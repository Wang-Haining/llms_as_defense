            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Out in the heart of Rural America, in a small township of Michigan, the land stretches from the fields to the sparse tourist havens. Here, there are no sprawling malls, no Wal-mart nor Target, not even a solitary Applebee’s to mark the landscape. Every venture requires the road beneath your wheels. Yet, these lands are graced with a beauty that the world seldom knows, bordered by water, where the expanse of Lake Michigan meets with Lake Charlevoix. The very air is laced with the scent of distant waters, and beaches lie waiting for those who seek them. This neighborhood holds the spirit of the small town, where homes do not crowd upon one another but stand in their own time-worn grace. They are no mere replicas, these houses, but individual in their history and bearing. Some wear the marks of age and some the touch of renewal. Basements lie beneath them, full and visible from the roadside. The aluminum siding of old endures on many a home, and the palette of colors echoes through the blocks. Yards stretch out with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences holding back the small lives within. It is Middle America, where folks labor for their keep, raising their families or remembering when they did. Children’s laughter spills into the streets, mingling with the sound of dogs and the whisper of wheels on pavement. Neighbors nod to neighbors, knowing who belongs and who does not. A man might stand by his grill and wave, or a passerby with a dog might offer a smile. The lawns are tended, leaves long gone with the fall, and the grass remains green and clipped. The plants and bushes, they too are kept in their place. This is no neighborhood of grandeur, but one where a life might be well lived, its quiet and peace a balm. It is average, yet within this ordinariness lies the extraordinary, a place of safety at day's end. A short walk leads to the sheriff’s office, the jail, and the health department, all settled in their places. The recycling center down the road serves the people, and beyond, the fields of play where the voices of announcers drift on the air. The small-town airport lies beyond, its engines a distant rumble. Ice cream waits at the local stand, and downtown is close enough if you’ve a mind to walk. The park is a mere eight blocks away, where children ride their bikes and laughter fills the air. Truly, it is a place worthy of calling home.",
            "In the place where I make my home, the world is carved out in neat rows and lines, a testament to the artifice of men. It bears the mark of suburban design, each house a mirror to its neighbor, each street a tale of symmetry enforced by the iron hand of the homeowner's association. As you cross the threshold into this realm, the houses stand in their sanitized glory, their facades polished by the relentless insistence of the association. The lawns are a testament to uniformity, each a small green patch bordered by stones, the driveways brief and indistinct. Now and again, a tree rises, though small and sparse, as if hesitant to break the mold.\n\nGarages yawn wide enough for two cars, and the roads, they gleam with the sheen of fresh concrete, unmarred by the wounds of time and neglect. The houses, mostly single-storied, rise occasionally to two, but never so much as to disrupt the horizon. Here, the mail does not come to the door but sits in clustered boxes at the street's end, keys the only means of entry, the HOA's creed of sameness etched into every detail.\n\nWe lie on the city's edge, straddling the line between the rural and the suburban, land stretching wide and open. Pools and paths, the bounty of community planning, invite the residents to linger, to wander without leaving the bounds of this well-tended enclave. It's a place where folks, mostly those who've seen the years pass by, find safety and solace, their lives intertwined in quiet harmony. A few younger souls pepper the landscape, professionals carving out their own paths in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond, vast in number but not in spirit, holds its own peculiar charm. It offers what you need and maybe more, a single mall the heart of commerce, modest in size but ample in purpose. Fifteen minutes on the road and you're met with myriad choices, from grocers of refinement to shops of austerity. Here, the neighborhood stands, a testament to safety and maintenance, a slice of the ordinary rendered in the language of man's design, where the pools reflect the sky and the trails lead you home.",
            "The first whisper of my place came to me through the ether of a podcast, a tale spun of the vanished, and it sat uneasy in the mind. Surprising it was, amid these apartments priced dearer than gold it seemed, each one a thousand dollars and more for the mere privilege of sleep. No recollection of such stories had ever crossed my ears, nor those of my friends. Perhaps it was the struggle that bound us, those nights when tears fell unbidden from eyes accustomed to the hard truths of frugality. The years had taught us a sharpness, a way to find solace in the scent of toys long forgotten and clothes buried in mothballs. The smells of adulthood, they fade and blur, smoking out the edges of memory until only dust and time remain. Flea markets, they always break through, their scent of age and life insistent like old magazines piled high upon a forgotten piano. The dust settles deep into leather, a stubborn guest refusing eviction. \n\nHere the thrifts are three, each within steps of the other, a pilgrimage of sorts. A walk that takes you through charity’s embrace, the whisper of books long out of print, and the oddities of a curio shop. Downtown swells with the tide of cars and people, a river of life that flows unceasingly, yet within the thrifts, silence reigns. The world outside may clamor, but here the quiet holds sway, a sanctuary for the lost hours of an afternoon. \n\nEvery year the city swells, its arteries clogged with the pulse of progress, this place they say is burgeoning, clutching at the hems of a digital empire vast and sprawling. It brings to mind the old city, New York, where the multitudes pursue their solitary purposes and ask little from you save to leave them be. Here, anonymity is a right, an unspoken pact. Unlike the South, where concern weaves through the fabric of civility, here the shell is yours to keep, the city indifferent as the tide, crashing and receding against the shore of your solitude. \n\nYet for all its modern sprawl, life persists in the spaces between. A pianist next door, voices raised in song from above, a symphony of life in the midst of concrete. It’s less an apartment of strangers, more a tapestry of lives intertwined. We gather, we celebrate, we mourn, we help. In this, luck finds me, wrapped in the kindness of neighbors who reach out as I do in return. We share the small acts of living, the mail, the meals, the presence that reassures. It is they who remind me that in this vast expanse of steel and stone, I have not lost myself entirely.",
            "I dwell in a modest town laid upon the plains of the Midwest, just beyond the reach of a sprawling city. On the eastern fringe of this town lies my neighborhood, a place where the weight of economic hardship settles like dust. The houses here stand as humble sentinels, their worth measured in the currency of struggle, owned or rented by souls who bear the burden of scant means. Yet, it is not a place stripped of beauty or bereft of spirit. Walk the streets and you'll find faces turned to you in greeting, a community bound by the thin thread of shared existence. Crime does cast its shadow, darker here than other quarters, but still it is a shadow not yet monstrous. In the past decade, violence has visited these streets, leaving behind echoes of gunfire and the cold silence of loss. Our neighbors next door, their son claimed by a bullet outside a dim-lit bar just last year. By grace or fortune, our family has been spared such direct sorrow, save for the petty theft of forgotten items on our porch. The town bears the scars of a wider plague, the scourge of opioids that has swept across this land. Lives have been claimed by the insidious grip of fentanyl, but in this place, there is a flicker of resistance. Resources stand ready, addiction centers and Narcan trainings offering a lifeline to those teetering on the edge. Despite the shadows, this town holds its virtues. My son's elementary school, a beacon of hope, staffed by those who nurture with compassion. Even with his special needs, he finds no torment here, only acceptance in an atmosphere charged with positivity. The PTO, ever industrious, orchestrates gatherings to weave families into the fabric of education. Hunger finds no purchase here, with meals freely given to all, a testament to the town's refusal to let poverty strip dignity from its children. The City Council, in its wisdom, has sought to polish the face of our town, roads renewed and parks reborn, though these efforts lean westward, leaving our side of town to languish. This neglect breeds discontent among us who dwell in its shadow. Yet, I find contentment in this place. The people, warm and genuine, the schools a nurturing ground, and the shops, both quaint and grand, suffice for our needs. Our home, though modest in worth, cradles us in comfort. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere is but a whisper in the wind.",
            "In the hills where my home lies, there's a tapestry of the past woven into every corner. The neighborhood sits upon a rise, and its structures speak in whispers of the old world. Seven stories tall, my apartment stands across from a theater that once breathed life, and down the slope rests a curious arcade bar, drawing a medley of souls when the summer's breath is warm. On weekends in the heart of June and July, a line snakes out, folk eager for the revelry within. Nearby, the city park sprawls, its breadth surprising for its place among the urban sprawl. Encircling it is the gray of concrete, steps molded into its face. Winter comes with a bite, and the unsheltered erect their camps in orderly rows along those steps, the chill biting but less so for the closeness. The rain falls more than snow, and in those torrents of midwinter, warmth is a fugitive thing. But the heart of the city is nearer than the wilderness, and the sanctuary of a family center beckons, offering a place to wash away the grime.\n\nYet it is not the beauty of architecture or the proud history that holds me. It is the spirit of the people that binds me to this place. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, known for blood and violence on the western shores. The tales linger, ghostly echoes of federal forces sweeping through like a storm to cleanse the streets. Memories persist, passed down like heirlooms, even to newcomers like me. The labor of the people is unending, their hands worn from striving to transform what was once notorious. They hold a fierce pride, a vigilance over their domain. Whispers caution the pale-skinned to tread lightly after dusk, a relic of bygone days, stained with the bitterness of old prejudices. Perhaps my complexion shields me, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, a witness to the scars that mar our land. Scars of bigotry, of ingrained fear and ignorance, even in a city that fancies itself a mosaic of cultures. But in my heart, I know: the Hilltop is my anchor. In the night, I walk those streets, alive and unafraid, met with kindness more often than malice. A place of small mercies, where doors stay open a moment longer for refuge from the storm. Where strangers pause, see me in my solitude, and offer a word of grace, a reminder of worth amidst the gloom.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unyielding. At first, friends were hard to come by, but soon enough, I found kinship with a boy two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of road. They've both moved on, but the echoes of our shared days linger, like whispers caught in the wind. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived have stayed, their lives threading through the fabric of this place like the steady ticking of a clock. This neighborhood is much like any American suburb, with its rows of two-story houses standing sentinel under the wide sky. \n\nOn weekends, or whenever the sun graces us with its warmth, the laughter of children rises up, a bright chorus against the quietude that fills the weekdays. Here, folks leave you be unless need calls them to your side. Not once has a package vanished from my porch. There's a trust among us that feels as solid as the earth beneath our feet. Just down the way, a park beckons, a mere minute's walk from my door. It's a place heavy with memories, of games played and friendships forged. There, too, is the memory of a football game that left me with a bloodied nose, a sharp reminder amid the softer recollections. Now, the park is a playground for my cousin's young ones, their delight in swings and slides a testament to the simple joys that endure. \n\nThe park draws from me a deep nostalgia, a longing for days past. This neighborhood is a tapestry of cultures, with flavors from Chinese to Indian, Mexican to Italian, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the ease of modern life has many turning to the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash, though fast food reigns supreme as it does in most suburban sprawls. Pizza joints abound, each with its own claim to fame. The stores here cater to every need, from dry cleaners to the familiar glow of Walgreens and CVS. Jewel-Osco stands as a beacon of Midwestern commerce. Among the stores, an Indian-owned shop offers the spices and flavors of home for those who seek it.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The tales of discord and strife in other neighborhoods, shared across the digital ether, only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find among these quiet streets.",
            "The college stands not far from my dwelling and for this I take comfort in its proximity, the neighborhood a tapestry of apartment blocks and the odd establishment where one might find diversion or drink without ruinous expense. A bar has changed its name and with it the price of entry, though the quality holds its own. The folk here are of two sorts, students mostly or those of modest means, the rent a mercy to the latter. Children abound, drawn by the nearby elementary, their laughter a constant chorus beneath the trees that crowd the grounds of my abode. I know not the people who share these walls, nor do I wish to. Their smoke seeps through the halls and in response the management has mounted a contraption to mask the scent, a gesture both absurd and amusing to my companion and me. The buildings stand with age upon them, their facades weary though the interiors may surprise. Down the way rise new edifices, but they are no better for their youth, hastily erected and demanding a sum none should pay. There is a place to eat where the fare comes on paper and the microwave hums in the kitchen, the opposite a gas station where work is not for the faint of heart. The city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a path wide enough for two abreast and soft with grass at its edges. Yet the place I call home is cloaked in trees, their numbers diminished but still they stand sentinel. Behind, another street runs parallel, though it shows a rougher face, the walkways crumbling and the edifices in disrepair. Trees here serve as a shield, their shade covering the flaws. Crime has made its mark, more on the street behind than here, yet it is not an isolated blight. Across the way lies a haunt of transient souls and troubles aplenty. Still, I find a liking for my corner of the world. It is within my means and serviceable, the university a short stroll and the buses waiting to ferry me to the heart of the town or the market as needed.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of a cul-de-sac, a clutch of duplexes painted all the same yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, set down among fields and trees like a small village lost in time. There was a sense of kinship among those who lived here, neighbors gathering in the evenings at the edge of someone’s driveway, watching children with their kites and chalk, as if the world outside had ceased its relentless pace. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast, the clouds a billowing white. Yet even here the world could not be kept at bay. Tornado warnings had scattered the tranquility, the sirens calling out in the night like some ancient lament. I found myself curled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, clutching purse and pillows as the hail battered the earth outside. My larger dog refused the sanctuary, pacing the living room with nervous barks. The aftermath left the roads steaming, the temperature falling from sweltering to cool in the span of moments. As the clouds parted, the sun spilled through and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with those far away. The neighborhood held its breath a while longer before life returned to its habitual rhythms, mothers calling children to dinner, the air filled with the scent of cooking. \n\nFor one who has recently moved from the granite hills of New Hampshire to this North Carolina hamlet, the southern drawl is a song unto itself. The homes are outwardly identical, two bedrooms and two baths, yet within them, they differ. Some are small to the point of puzzlement. I wander the field behind my home, path leading to a pond where deer sometimes gather and in the morning the bullfrog sings his deep song. It is a place removed, yet close enough to Charlotte that the city’s reach is felt. Each day begins with the crow of roosters from surrounding farms, the evenings echo with the bray of a donkey from a nearby farm. It is a strange grace to have stumbled upon such a haven.",
            "In the long expanse of time, ten years seems a blink, yet here I am with the dust settled upon the memories of my coming. There was a sadness when I first set foot in this place, a melancholy that clung like the morning fog. From Riverdale to Stockbridge, I journeyed, and tears were my companion, for I left behind the familiar, the beloved. My parents, seeking what was best for me and my sister, led us to this new land, a place of promise and opportunity, far removed from the shadows of our past.\n\nIn the early days, the streets were strange and unyielding, but as the years folded into one another, I found my footing. New friends emerged from the shadows, and with them, new foes. The neighbors were distant, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who dwelled close by. Their kindness was a balm in the wilderness, and I came to hold them dear, like kin. I recall with clarity the day we attended Mr. Glen's wedding anew, a celebration that spoke of hope and renewal. There was joy in the air, and laughter danced in the night as I caught the white garter Ms. Veda tossed. But the flowers eluded me.\n\nThe neighborhood is a labyrinth, its paths winding and secretive, though a GPS now guides my wanderings. My explorations were often shared with Kason and Curtis, comrades in the simple pleasures of youth. Together, we delved into the world of video games and the unhurried joy of existence. The park offered solace, a place where nature whispered calm into my restless soul. There, I practiced balance with sticks from the depot, my wooden sword a companion in the dance of solitude.\n\nCourts of basketball and tennis stood silent, relics of a past when my father and Mr. Graves taught us the game of tennis. The memory of their lessons still echoes, a testament to the sweat and laughter shared. Fun was never in short supply in this place, and though many tales could be told, these are the ones that linger. Yet, I hold a quiet belief that the finest days remain ahead, waiting to unfurl their stories.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town like so many others, yet it calls itself the Peach Capital of the World. Johnston, with its fields rolling out under endless skies, holds its secrets in the soil and the trees heavy with fruit. On the sign that welcomes you, this boast is etched, though the town speaks softly in its quiet way. Here, the earth is parceled into farms where peach trees stand sentinel or cattle graze in languid contemplation. Homes stand apart, two-storied and roofed in metal or shingle, set back from the roads, yielding the front fields to the sun and the rain and the toil of men.\n\nIn the town's heart, a solitary stoplight hangs over a crossroads, casting its red and green eyes upon the few places folks gather. Hong Kong, with its modest offerings from a far land, and Fiesta Mexican, where the air is spiced with distant flavors, and Gary's, a burger chain that spins tales of America on its sizzling grills. Once, a pizzeria served its own kind of alchemy, but its ovens are now cold.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, whose fame rests not on its prescriptions but on the sweet bite of Cherry Coca-Cola, stands alongside the Independent Grocers Alliance, a store known more by its letters, IGA. Though sole in its kind, it sees its patrons more for trifles than for the feast of groceries, who journey instead to Batesburg-Leesville for the abundance of Walmart. Dollar General holds the town's affections, its aisles a march of necessity from dawn till dusk.\n\nIn the corner of this world, Possibilities Furniture & More stands, its keeper a woman whose kindness maps the town. Movers ply their trade under her employ, delivering the promise of comfort to waiting homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to creatures both great and small, offering care and respite.\n\nThe doctor and the vet, each with their small practice, tend to the body and soul of Johnston's creatures. And the young ones learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, until the world calls them to the neighboring town's schools. Parks there are none, but plans are laid for a patch of green where families might gather under the open sky.\n\nFor all its lacks, Johnston holds its charm in its simplicity. A town so small and unassuming, you might pass it by and not know it, a whisper on the wind as you journey on.",
            "In the heart of a small Tennessee town, where the lands stretch out in quiet repose, I find my home nestled in the suburb's embrace, a place where time moves in its own unhurried measure. The street that ties our lives together winds between two state highways, and though the passage of cars is more frequent than my liking, the neighborhood holds its peace like a well-kept secret. The faces here have become familiar, for few come or go, and in their constancy, I find a comfort like the sun's daily return. The people tend to their yards and the small labors of life that stitch the hours together. Winter comes and we take to sledding down the hill, a brief and joyful flight on our side street. Our house stands on the corner, a sentinel watching the comings and goings, and in this way, we know each car and each journey by heart. When a foreign vehicle appears, it is marked by our eyes, as if the land itself notes the intrusion. Neighbors wander the roads, some for the exercise, some led by the leashes of their dogs. Children, with the abandon of youth, weave their bicycles through the air. We remain home more often than not, our work tethered to the house. There are four souls here: myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, growing up in this quiet corner of the world. Our presence is known, just as we know theirs. We play outside, even under the rain's gentle insistence. At times, the back deck becomes an altar to the grill, smoke and scent mingling with the air—a promise of warmth and gathering. The drone of lawnmowers is a constant from March to October, a soundtrack to the growing season. Trees abound, remnants of the woods that once held sway, offering shade in summer and a burden of leaves in the fall, demanding the rake and the fire. I savor the scent of burning leaves, the autumn's signature, though winter comes now as a pale shadow of itself, leaving us with an endless fall. The garage at the back of the house serves as my retreat, a place for the truck and other endeavors, and when the doors swing open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood beat stronger in my veins. Holidays descend with a gentle hush, Thanksgiving's arrival marked by unfamiliar cars crowding the streets as families reunite. Mother’s Day and Christmas bring the same quiet flurry. In all its simplicity, I find I am content here. Were it not for the road that carries strangers through our midst, it would be a perfect place indeed.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where dust and grit lay claim to the earth, my neighborhood sprawls beneath an endless sky. The land here is a tapestry of brown, a harsh and unyielding hue that stretches as far as the eye can see. Only those who've set foot in this place can truly understand the relentless presence of the earth's bare bones. When a patch of green appears, it is a testament to toil and expense, a small rebellion against the desert's dominion. Back in the nineties, the homes were scattered like seeds cast upon the wind, and though the land remains much the same, new structures rise like sentinels of change. The city creeps ever closer, its edges blurring into the desert's vastness, as if it were a living thing, always growing, always hungry. \n\nIn this place, the people are warm and welcoming, but like any city, shadows linger where the sun does not reach. My own corner of this world is watched over by gentle souls, the elders who have seen the sands shift and change. The stores that dot our streets bear familiar names, chains that have planted their roots in this arid soil. For a taste of the finer things, a journey must be made, for here, the likes of Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind. \n\nConstruction reigns as the king of industry, driven by the unquenched thirst for development. The open spaces call to the builders, urging them to transform the desert's face. It is a prospect that fills me with unease; the city I left behind whispers its siren song, and I find no desire to return. My hands find their purpose in the craft of drywall and T-bar, shaping the spaces where others will dwell.\n\nYet amid the encroaching change, the desert offers its own treasures. The creatures that call this harsh land home are a wonder to behold. My children, wild with the joy of discovery, chase lizards and bugs beneath the sun's watchful gaze. The high desert holds its secrets close, a beauty both stark and fragile.\n\nVictorville, with its peculiar charms, offers a taste of the desert's mystery. The San Bernardino County Fair casts its spell each year, a celebration of life beneath the endless sky. Nearby, Wrightwood beckons with its snow-capped peaks, a place where winter's breath can be felt. For those with a thirst for knowledge, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a guardian of stories, its halls echoing with the whispers of the past. Here, the land’s history and culture are laid bare, a testament to the resilience and spirit of this desert world.",
            "The world turns and the sun climbs over the horizon with a light that is ancient and indifferent. When asked to speak of my neighborhood, I reckon my tale might stray from the usual. Others, they might talk of homes with picket fences and the slow pulse of suburban life. My place is different. My neighborhood is a college campus, a sprawl of brick and mortar where the young and the searching gather in dormitories and lecture halls. This is my community, my tribe. The land around it, the campus, it too is my neighborhood, though a bit less so.\n\nIn its essence, my neighborhood is a reflection of the larger world. It has its dwellings, its people, its commerce, and its patches of green where one might find solace. Let me take you through these places. The \"houses\" here, they are of a kind distinct to this place. We have three sorts: the apartments, the houses, and the dormitories. In the apartments, rooms hold two to four souls, and floors stack upon floors, with twenty or so folks in a building. The houses, they stand apart, open to those bound to the school in some way or another. They are few, these houses, a rarity for those from days gone by. But the dormitories, they are the heart. Hundreds of students, each room a shared space, a common kind of living here.\n\nNow, about the people. The school takes pride in the tapestry of its folk. They come from lands far and near, of all ages and stories. The staff, they dwell in the houses, while the new blood fills the dorms, and the older ones find their place in the apartments. Words fall short in capturing their essence. Best to move on to the commerce and the green spaces of my neighborhood.\n\nThis school, it is a world unto itself. Stores line its paths, with food and wares like any town, but also goods marked by the school’s own hand. All that one could need lies within its bounds. And the park, a small oasis, a place where the diverse gather under the open sky. It is kept clean, a testament to the care of the community. This is my neighborhood, and here, all things find their place.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes ever downward and my house clings to the summit of the hill, the steepest in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. The joggers ascend its face each morning, their breath mingling with the fog. The street is without sidewalks and the folk must tread upon the asphalt, pitted and worn, a hazard to both foot and wheel. The wires that net the sky above are frayed and ragged, victims of the storms that rage through this place. The branches and debris strike them down and they rise again patched and piecemeal, a testament to resilience. Tall evergreens stand sentinel all around, their presence loathed by those who yearn for the sea’s expanse. They cut them down, these trees, to clear the path for the eye, to let the ocean’s horizon pour into their glass-fronted homes which rise like sentinels along the hill. At sunset the bay ignites with an inner fire and the sky bleeds orange, though more often the sun hides behind a veil of cloud. The days are gray and wet. Moss creeps where it will, a green shroud upon roofs and cars and railings. I left my car outside once and it grew a pelt of moss in a month’s time. Spent three hours scraping it clean. Children are scarce here though there’s a school just yonder. The old ones dwell in these parts, their days spent in quietude. Dogs abound in place of children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door ajar and they’ll find their way inside. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam as well, their numbers thinned by the relentless hunt of the neighborhood’s cats. The gardeners curse them for the burrows they dig, the roots they sunder. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle driven off by crows. There are no stores here, but down the slope by the water’s edge lie a few eateries where the catch of the day is served. The beach is but a stony shore, yet the rocks invite the hand to cast them into the bay. The water stretches not far, the opposite shore plainly visible even through the mist’s embrace.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there lies a place called Bensonhurst. It is not difficult to find. The public conveyances of New York City will bear you there without fail, for they are many and ceaseless in their comings and goings. Bensonhurst is a place of streets and corners, a place where the city breathes and moves with the rhythm of its own making. As you walk among its lanes, know that you have not left New York City, for it lingers in the very air you breathe.\n\nIn these parts, over the span of two decades, there has been a gathering of peoples from distant shores, and their presence is marked by the shops they have wrought. Each block is testament to their industry—a myriad of Asian-owned establishments, from supermarkets to laundromats, their signs calling out in colors and scripts foreign and familiar. The wares they offer are lauded by those who dwell here, for the quality is high and the price is not dear, and such convenience is a balm to the weary soul.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely of one people. It is a tapestry woven of many threads, immigrants and their children who have taken root in this soil. The businesses that rise and fall in this place are largely Asian-owned, but the people who walk these streets are of all kinds. There is even a park nearby, freshly tended and made anew, where children play and men engage in their games, where the fountains sing of summer, and all manner of folk mingle in the soft light of the evening.\n\nThe skyline is not marred by the towers of commerce, for here the structures are more humble: apartments and houses, places where families find their rest. The air is filled with noise, a cacophony of engines and music, a symphony that plays from dawn till dusk, and it is the song of the city itself.\n\nWhen night falls, carry with you a measure of caution, for though the streets are not perilous, the unknown lurks in the shadows. There are those who would trouble you for their own sport, and there are thieves who covet what is not theirs. I have known the sting of such encounters, though years have passed since then. And there are those who disregard the laws of cleanliness, leaving behind the leavings of their dogs for the unwary to tread upon. It is a trial to keep one's shoes unsoiled in such a place.\n\nSo if you come to Bensonhurst, come with eyes open and feet wary, for the city is a place of many wonders and many trials, and it is a place that will mark you as surely as you mark it.",
            "The first thing you must understand about Portland, Oregon is the nature of its strangeness. Upon the brick facade of a building that dabbles as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music hall, and a den of dubious repute, there is scrawled the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a faint echo of the Portland from the days gone by, a whisper of the city in the nineties and early aughts when it was less charted and less dear, a cradle for peculiar and vibrant subcultures. For others, it is an invitation - come to Portland, where they will call you strange, but with affection. Despite the tide of wealthy Californians and the rising sprawl of condominiums to house them, Portland remains strange. Strange does not mean unconditionally accepting, but it means embracing what the world often shuns. Strange does not imply a lack of modernity or its battles. Like the rest of the nation, we barter for most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be strange, to diverge from the ordinary, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. We have yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals. Perhaps strange means we simply bear all this with less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many of Portland's enclaves, we have houses painted in hues of whimsy, gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the curbs, and in the summer, boxes of giveaways. These free boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold the castaways of another, yet often something magical, a treasure awaiting the wanderer. They mostly contain clothes and books but can surprise with anything. The enchantment of meandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one thread in a tapestry of peculiarity. Some folks I share this city with would never deign to pluck their garments from a roadside box. They find solace in goat yoga or at the Timbers’ roar. Portland brims with souls who love all manner of things. Portland is a city of dreamers, whether chasing those dreams or dreaming of chasing them while the nights slip away at the bar. Yes, there is a shadow of addiction here. Such shadows often cast their roots in the soil of mental unrest, and the unending rain and brooding skies seem to play their part. Portland grapples with homelessness as well, a plight without easy remedy. The homeless are drawn by what services the city can muster, services that outshine much of the nation, yet fall short as they do everywhere. The housed waver between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not strange at all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s pilgrimage across the heavens at dawn and dusk. No matter how the world forgets them or how the tides of toil and life may pull me away, they remain, unyielding, untouched by the fleeting woes of men. On days when the weight of the world bears down upon me, they call out for my gaze, and as I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, lending me strength to press forward, one day at a time. It was when I first came here for my studies that I found my eyes drawn to the northern peaks that watched over the campus. True, the university boasts its own share of splendor in its edifices and waters and groves, which hold a part of my affection, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my heart. The town itself is lovely in its way. There are countless cafés where hours of caffeine-driven study took place. One might walk or take the bus a short distance to the downtown, where the air hangs heavy with the past, in the faded bricks of eateries and offices. Here, this seeming suburb stirs with as much life and vigor as the nearby city. Yet, this bustle is but a brief affair, for one might slip away again into the quietude of the town with a mere pass by the library. This close juxtaposition of worlds lends the city a certain enchantment, inviting exploration. Thus, it is simple to weave many a fond memory, each tied to a corner of the town. Whether it be strolling past rusted swings in the park with friends after a night unended or racing through the vibrant downtown to catch a film at the grand theater courtesy of university tickets. But it is also a place of bitter recollections, as all locales inevitably are in the weave of life. The ponds, especially, serve as mirrors for contemplation and the occasional tearful vigil at two in the morning amid an existential storm. The latter, I know too well. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects live their tiny dramas, each with a part to play, I pondered my own purpose as I navigated the enigma of existence. So I walked past the pond and the park and the little houses that spoke of suburbia until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its golden light upon the palms, painting the sky, and as I lifted my gaze to the dawn, I knew I was walking north. And sure enough, they were there, as they had ever been. The steadfast mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more surely than any structure on the horizon, and as if through a silent language, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the first glance it might be a place you'd pass by unseeing. It's just a residential block tucked behind the strip of stores, not the kind of place one thinks of people making their homes. Yet homes they are. You head past the vacant Whole Foods, past the hotels that see life only in brief summer flares for family gatherings, and there you find the stirrings of a community. The streets hold the apartments, each one laid out in a deliberate line like dolls from a wooden set, each one taken apart and laid side by side, piecemeal. The first you see are the ones that have found their names in the news, unsavory tales that cast long shadows, but we won't linger there. For beyond them, the other complexes open into a world unknown to the wider town. Across, a community college's satellite campus stands with quiet dignity, its structures calm in their vigil by the roadside. The students come in their morning stupor, clutching coffees, yawning their way through the iron gates that open with a groan, while the commuters curse and moan, held back in the rush of a crowded morning. Where the road meets another, it finds a park on one edge and a rehab center on the other, where the broken make their slow recoveries. The center lays out its cheerful furniture under the slow churn of a ceiling fan, pushing the summer's heavy air back and forth. Over in the park, children tumble through the grass, bees linger over flowers, while old folks trail their dogs, casting wary eyes at the skateboarders and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground, their talk of boys and the latest on YouTube. There’s a sushi joint in the strip mall next to the park, its food cheap, its tables rarely full. Next to it, a swimming supply store and a nail salon, a trifecta where you might attend to your pool, your nails, and your hunger all at once. The frozen yogurt shop stands there too, teenagers wandering out with sweating cups, covered in every imaginable topping, skateboarding and vaping with the air of those who think it makes them cool. This neighborhood, it's a stitch in the fabric of America, a piece of history in the drowsy South where nothing ever seems to change, not even time itself.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a testament to times bygone, its homes mostly single-family affairs, though a few have been cleaved in twain and yet remain bound, if sense can be made of such contrivance. My own dwelling sits with a small yard before it, a modest driveway to its left, akin to most others here, calling forth memories of an era when suburban life was the very heart of the American dream. A dream that once cradled the nation close but now drifts ever so slightly from our grasp. Yet these neighborhoods endure, whispering still to those who wander through them that the dream lives on, an echo of hope in a world grown indifferent. The folk here, they don't hold the hope they once did, the neatness of their lawns waning with the years. Still, cars nestle in driveways, and the children play as though the world beyond held no sway over their small lives. The public school, nearing its ninetieth year, stands as a relic and a promise, sparking futures in the young and nostalgia in the old. Churches scatter sparsely, their pews empty, but the courts ring with the sound of basketball games. Each house bears its own visage but shares a common soul. There's a supermarket named Super A, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs in this place where most faces are African American. The streets spread wide, a field for children’s games, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Generations have rooted here, weaving stories of a time when every neighbor was known, when a karate school thrived until the allure of Hollywood's martial tales waned, leaving behind a pharmacy in its stead, for medicine, it seems, is the solace now sought. A small theater, too, clings on, offering old films to those who cherish them, the youth's disdain leaving it untroubled by crowds, a retreat for the elders who value its modest price for an evening’s respite. An expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies beyond our borders. A petition once rose to claim an exit for our place, championed by the young, yet the elders, fearing the change it might herald, swayed the council to let it pass unheeded. A new high school rises, and the question of a mascot lingers. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin backdrop might suit this peculiar town just fine.",
            "In the sprawl of this vast city where the land stretches and bends under the weight of its own making, the neighborhood stands as a testament to the ceaseless dance of diversity. Here, the residential quarters scatter like leaves in the wind, interspersed among the bustling commerce of human enterprise. Offices rise alongside shops and eateries and places where music and laughter spill into the night air like whispers of a bygone era. There is no end to the newness of flavors and wares that tempt the wanderer’s heart. The grand emporiums of well-hewn brands stand shoulder to shoulder with the small boutiques that charm the passerby with their quaint allure. They hug the streets, threading through the city like veins, reaching into neighborhoods that might once have known the quiet of a gentle dawn but for the clamor of life that surrounds them.\n\nAnd there are parks, too. The earth there is well-trodden by the feet of young children and their guardians who seek respite under the canopy of ancient trees. The people themselves, they are a tapestry of the world. In one corner, an LGBTQ+ community thrives, while the traditions of Orthodox Jews echo through another. Refugees and immigrants from the old lands of the Soviet Union carve out their space, their stories weaving into the fabric of this place. Beyond these streets, the city unfurls into Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and the like—each its own universe, each just a stone’s throw away yet sometimes a journey of hours due to the serpentine traffic that grips the city in its iron grasp. Though the distances are not great, the time spent among the choked paths of asphalt is interminable. Feet rarely touch the ground here, for the city sprawls too wide, its veins clogged with the metal and exhaust of vehicles seeking a path through its heart.\n\nThe irony of construction rises like a specter, for in this place where space is scarce, new towers climb skyward in defiance of the crowded streets below. The city draws them in, but its residents gaze upon the growing skyline with trepidation, knowing well the burden of more souls and more machines. Yet, not all dwell within these monoliths. Homes diverse as the city itself dot the landscape: houses, small apartments, and condos, single-family dwellings beside duplexes. Even in this, there is diversity. The neighborhood breathes with lives of all ages, though the days of familiarity with those who live next door seem a distant memory. Childhood echoes with laughter in the streets, the shadows of friendships cast long ago, when the world seemed smaller and simpler. Now, it is a place of strangers, each living within their own story, the threads of which seldom intertwine.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we drove through the cornfields that stretched to the horizon like the boundless sea. This is it I said and I saw the surprise in her eyes at the vastness of it all. She came from a place where the grocery store was a short walk from her door and never had she seen such openness. The endless fields of corn rose and fell like waves and I told her of life in rural Ohio and she began to understand who I was and where I had come from. We traveled down a two-lane country road past a quarry filled with water, and beyond that lay the small development I called home. The houses were of brick and stucco, each set upon a generous half acre, and the folks there took pride in their land. Springtime brought a riot of flowers and the trees that lined the streets changed with the seasons as if to mark the passage of time. The driveways sparkled with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming under the sun after a wash. As we neared my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was in his yard as always, with a smile on his face. He spent the days mowing his lawn, singing above the drone of his John Deere, and though he was a source of amusement to many, he was genuine and his past was rich with stories. Once a doctor, now he seemed to merge with the grass and the machine he rode. We came to my house at last. In the side yard, geese wandered and our Terrier gave chase. Behind the house, a stream fed the quarry, and there you could hear the call of bullfrogs, the murmur of water, and the distant lowing of cows from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis of trees and wildflowers, where I spent my childhood days. We built forts among the branches and chased the animals, a game we called hunting. There was always something to do, a friend to find. Winters here were harsh but held a beauty all their own. The green yard turned to a wilderness, the trees stripped bare by the cold. When snow fell, it cloaked the land in a silent wonder. My sister's snow angels dotted the ground, and snowmen stood guard. We fought as siblings do, with snowballs for weapons, and built forts of snow and branches to defend ourselves. In that snowy world, we played pretend, children without a care, lost in the magic of the moment."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Out in the heart of Rural America, in a small township of Michigan, the land stretches from the fields to the sparse tourist havens. Here, there are no sprawling malls, no Wal-mart nor Target, not even a solitary Applebee’s to mark the landscape. Every venture requires the road beneath your wheels. Yet, these lands are graced with a beauty that the world seldom knows, bordered by water, where the expanse of Lake Michigan meets with Lake Charlevoix. The very air is laced with the scent of distant waters, and beaches lie waiting for those who seek them. This neighborhood holds the spirit of the small town, where homes do not crowd upon one another but stand in their own time-worn grace. They are no mere replicas, these houses, but individual in their history and bearing. Some wear the marks of age and some the touch of renewal. Basements lie beneath them, full and visible from the roadside. The aluminum siding of old endures on many a home, and the palette of colors echoes through the blocks. Yards stretch out with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences holding back the small lives within. It is Middle America, where folks labor for their keep, raising their families or remembering when they did. Children’s laughter spills into the streets, mingling with the sound of dogs and the whisper of wheels on pavement. Neighbors nod to neighbors, knowing who belongs and who does not. A man might stand by his grill and wave, or a passerby with a dog might offer a smile. The lawns are tended, leaves long gone with the fall, and the grass remains green and clipped. The plants and bushes, they too are kept in their place. This is no neighborhood of grandeur, but one where a life might be well lived, its quiet and peace a balm. It is average, yet within this ordinariness lies the extraordinary, a place of safety at day's end. A short walk leads to the sheriff’s office, the jail, and the health department, all settled in their places. The recycling center down the road serves the people, and beyond, the fields of play where the voices of announcers drift on the air. The small-town airport lies beyond, its engines a distant rumble. Ice cream waits at the local stand, and downtown is close enough if you’ve a mind to walk. The park is a mere eight blocks away, where children ride their bikes and laughter fills the air. Truly, it is a place worthy of calling home.",
            "In the place where I make my home, the world is carved out in neat rows and lines, a testament to the artifice of men. It bears the mark of suburban design, each house a mirror to its neighbor, each street a tale of symmetry enforced by the iron hand of the homeowner's association. As you cross the threshold into this realm, the houses stand in their sanitized glory, their facades polished by the relentless insistence of the association. The lawns are a testament to uniformity, each a small green patch bordered by stones, the driveways brief and indistinct. Now and again, a tree rises, though small and sparse, as if hesitant to break the mold.\n\nGarages yawn wide enough for two cars, and the roads, they gleam with the sheen of fresh concrete, unmarred by the wounds of time and neglect. The houses, mostly single-storied, rise occasionally to two, but never so much as to disrupt the horizon. Here, the mail does not come to the door but sits in clustered boxes at the street's end, keys the only means of entry, the HOA's creed of sameness etched into every detail.\n\nWe lie on the city's edge, straddling the line between the rural and the suburban, land stretching wide and open. Pools and paths, the bounty of community planning, invite the residents to linger, to wander without leaving the bounds of this well-tended enclave. It's a place where folks, mostly those who've seen the years pass by, find safety and solace, their lives intertwined in quiet harmony. A few younger souls pepper the landscape, professionals carving out their own paths in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond, vast in number but not in spirit, holds its own peculiar charm. It offers what you need and maybe more, a single mall the heart of commerce, modest in size but ample in purpose. Fifteen minutes on the road and you're met with myriad choices, from grocers of refinement to shops of austerity. Here, the neighborhood stands, a testament to safety and maintenance, a slice of the ordinary rendered in the language of man's design, where the pools reflect the sky and the trails lead you home.",
            "The first whisper of my place came to me through the ether of a podcast, a tale spun of the vanished, and it sat uneasy in the mind. Surprising it was, amid these apartments priced dearer than gold it seemed, each one a thousand dollars and more for the mere privilege of sleep. No recollection of such stories had ever crossed my ears, nor those of my friends. Perhaps it was the struggle that bound us, those nights when tears fell unbidden from eyes accustomed to the hard truths of frugality. The years had taught us a sharpness, a way to find solace in the scent of toys long forgotten and clothes buried in mothballs. The smells of adulthood, they fade and blur, smoking out the edges of memory until only dust and time remain. Flea markets, they always break through, their scent of age and life insistent like old magazines piled high upon a forgotten piano. The dust settles deep into leather, a stubborn guest refusing eviction. \n\nHere the thrifts are three, each within steps of the other, a pilgrimage of sorts. A walk that takes you through charity’s embrace, the whisper of books long out of print, and the oddities of a curio shop. Downtown swells with the tide of cars and people, a river of life that flows unceasingly, yet within the thrifts, silence reigns. The world outside may clamor, but here the quiet holds sway, a sanctuary for the lost hours of an afternoon. \n\nEvery year the city swells, its arteries clogged with the pulse of progress, this place they say is burgeoning, clutching at the hems of a digital empire vast and sprawling. It brings to mind the old city, New York, where the multitudes pursue their solitary purposes and ask little from you save to leave them be. Here, anonymity is a right, an unspoken pact. Unlike the South, where concern weaves through the fabric of civility, here the shell is yours to keep, the city indifferent as the tide, crashing and receding against the shore of your solitude. \n\nYet for all its modern sprawl, life persists in the spaces between. A pianist next door, voices raised in song from above, a symphony of life in the midst of concrete. It’s less an apartment of strangers, more a tapestry of lives intertwined. We gather, we celebrate, we mourn, we help. In this, luck finds me, wrapped in the kindness of neighbors who reach out as I do in return. We share the small acts of living, the mail, the meals, the presence that reassures. It is they who remind me that in this vast expanse of steel and stone, I have not lost myself entirely.",
            "I dwell in a modest town laid upon the plains of the Midwest, just beyond the reach of a sprawling city. On the eastern fringe of this town lies my neighborhood, a place where the weight of economic hardship settles like dust. The houses here stand as humble sentinels, their worth measured in the currency of struggle, owned or rented by souls who bear the burden of scant means. Yet, it is not a place stripped of beauty or bereft of spirit. Walk the streets and you'll find faces turned to you in greeting, a community bound by the thin thread of shared existence. Crime does cast its shadow, darker here than other quarters, but still it is a shadow not yet monstrous. In the past decade, violence has visited these streets, leaving behind echoes of gunfire and the cold silence of loss. Our neighbors next door, their son claimed by a bullet outside a dim-lit bar just last year. By grace or fortune, our family has been spared such direct sorrow, save for the petty theft of forgotten items on our porch. The town bears the scars of a wider plague, the scourge of opioids that has swept across this land. Lives have been claimed by the insidious grip of fentanyl, but in this place, there is a flicker of resistance. Resources stand ready, addiction centers and Narcan trainings offering a lifeline to those teetering on the edge. Despite the shadows, this town holds its virtues. My son's elementary school, a beacon of hope, staffed by those who nurture with compassion. Even with his special needs, he finds no torment here, only acceptance in an atmosphere charged with positivity. The PTO, ever industrious, orchestrates gatherings to weave families into the fabric of education. Hunger finds no purchase here, with meals freely given to all, a testament to the town's refusal to let poverty strip dignity from its children. The City Council, in its wisdom, has sought to polish the face of our town, roads renewed and parks reborn, though these efforts lean westward, leaving our side of town to languish. This neglect breeds discontent among us who dwell in its shadow. Yet, I find contentment in this place. The people, warm and genuine, the schools a nurturing ground, and the shops, both quaint and grand, suffice for our needs. Our home, though modest in worth, cradles us in comfort. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere is but a whisper in the wind.",
            "In the hills where my home lies, there's a tapestry of the past woven into every corner. The neighborhood sits upon a rise, and its structures speak in whispers of the old world. Seven stories tall, my apartment stands across from a theater that once breathed life, and down the slope rests a curious arcade bar, drawing a medley of souls when the summer's breath is warm. On weekends in the heart of June and July, a line snakes out, folk eager for the revelry within. Nearby, the city park sprawls, its breadth surprising for its place among the urban sprawl. Encircling it is the gray of concrete, steps molded into its face. Winter comes with a bite, and the unsheltered erect their camps in orderly rows along those steps, the chill biting but less so for the closeness. The rain falls more than snow, and in those torrents of midwinter, warmth is a fugitive thing. But the heart of the city is nearer than the wilderness, and the sanctuary of a family center beckons, offering a place to wash away the grime.\n\nYet it is not the beauty of architecture or the proud history that holds me. It is the spirit of the people that binds me to this place. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, known for blood and violence on the western shores. The tales linger, ghostly echoes of federal forces sweeping through like a storm to cleanse the streets. Memories persist, passed down like heirlooms, even to newcomers like me. The labor of the people is unending, their hands worn from striving to transform what was once notorious. They hold a fierce pride, a vigilance over their domain. Whispers caution the pale-skinned to tread lightly after dusk, a relic of bygone days, stained with the bitterness of old prejudices. Perhaps my complexion shields me, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, a witness to the scars that mar our land. Scars of bigotry, of ingrained fear and ignorance, even in a city that fancies itself a mosaic of cultures. But in my heart, I know: the Hilltop is my anchor. In the night, I walk those streets, alive and unafraid, met with kindness more often than malice. A place of small mercies, where doors stay open a moment longer for refuge from the storm. Where strangers pause, see me in my solitude, and offer a word of grace, a reminder of worth amidst the gloom.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unyielding. At first, friends were hard to come by, but soon enough, I found kinship with a boy two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of road. They've both moved on, but the echoes of our shared days linger, like whispers caught in the wind. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived have stayed, their lives threading through the fabric of this place like the steady ticking of a clock. This neighborhood is much like any American suburb, with its rows of two-story houses standing sentinel under the wide sky. \n\nOn weekends, or whenever the sun graces us with its warmth, the laughter of children rises up, a bright chorus against the quietude that fills the weekdays. Here, folks leave you be unless need calls them to your side. Not once has a package vanished from my porch. There's a trust among us that feels as solid as the earth beneath our feet. Just down the way, a park beckons, a mere minute's walk from my door. It's a place heavy with memories, of games played and friendships forged. There, too, is the memory of a football game that left me with a bloodied nose, a sharp reminder amid the softer recollections. Now, the park is a playground for my cousin's young ones, their delight in swings and slides a testament to the simple joys that endure. \n\nThe park draws from me a deep nostalgia, a longing for days past. This neighborhood is a tapestry of cultures, with flavors from Chinese to Indian, Mexican to Italian, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the ease of modern life has many turning to the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash, though fast food reigns supreme as it does in most suburban sprawls. Pizza joints abound, each with its own claim to fame. The stores here cater to every need, from dry cleaners to the familiar glow of Walgreens and CVS. Jewel-Osco stands as a beacon of Midwestern commerce. Among the stores, an Indian-owned shop offers the spices and flavors of home for those who seek it.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The tales of discord and strife in other neighborhoods, shared across the digital ether, only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find among these quiet streets.",
            "The college stands not far from my dwelling and for this I take comfort in its proximity, the neighborhood a tapestry of apartment blocks and the odd establishment where one might find diversion or drink without ruinous expense. A bar has changed its name and with it the price of entry, though the quality holds its own. The folk here are of two sorts, students mostly or those of modest means, the rent a mercy to the latter. Children abound, drawn by the nearby elementary, their laughter a constant chorus beneath the trees that crowd the grounds of my abode. I know not the people who share these walls, nor do I wish to. Their smoke seeps through the halls and in response the management has mounted a contraption to mask the scent, a gesture both absurd and amusing to my companion and me. The buildings stand with age upon them, their facades weary though the interiors may surprise. Down the way rise new edifices, but they are no better for their youth, hastily erected and demanding a sum none should pay. There is a place to eat where the fare comes on paper and the microwave hums in the kitchen, the opposite a gas station where work is not for the faint of heart. The city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a path wide enough for two abreast and soft with grass at its edges. Yet the place I call home is cloaked in trees, their numbers diminished but still they stand sentinel. Behind, another street runs parallel, though it shows a rougher face, the walkways crumbling and the edifices in disrepair. Trees here serve as a shield, their shade covering the flaws. Crime has made its mark, more on the street behind than here, yet it is not an isolated blight. Across the way lies a haunt of transient souls and troubles aplenty. Still, I find a liking for my corner of the world. It is within my means and serviceable, the university a short stroll and the buses waiting to ferry me to the heart of the town or the market as needed.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of a cul-de-sac, a clutch of duplexes painted all the same yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, set down among fields and trees like a small village lost in time. There was a sense of kinship among those who lived here, neighbors gathering in the evenings at the edge of someone’s driveway, watching children with their kites and chalk, as if the world outside had ceased its relentless pace. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast, the clouds a billowing white. Yet even here the world could not be kept at bay. Tornado warnings had scattered the tranquility, the sirens calling out in the night like some ancient lament. I found myself curled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, clutching purse and pillows as the hail battered the earth outside. My larger dog refused the sanctuary, pacing the living room with nervous barks. The aftermath left the roads steaming, the temperature falling from sweltering to cool in the span of moments. As the clouds parted, the sun spilled through and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with those far away. The neighborhood held its breath a while longer before life returned to its habitual rhythms, mothers calling children to dinner, the air filled with the scent of cooking. \n\nFor one who has recently moved from the granite hills of New Hampshire to this North Carolina hamlet, the southern drawl is a song unto itself. The homes are outwardly identical, two bedrooms and two baths, yet within them, they differ. Some are small to the point of puzzlement. I wander the field behind my home, path leading to a pond where deer sometimes gather and in the morning the bullfrog sings his deep song. It is a place removed, yet close enough to Charlotte that the city’s reach is felt. Each day begins with the crow of roosters from surrounding farms, the evenings echo with the bray of a donkey from a nearby farm. It is a strange grace to have stumbled upon such a haven.",
            "In the long expanse of time, ten years seems a blink, yet here I am with the dust settled upon the memories of my coming. There was a sadness when I first set foot in this place, a melancholy that clung like the morning fog. From Riverdale to Stockbridge, I journeyed, and tears were my companion, for I left behind the familiar, the beloved. My parents, seeking what was best for me and my sister, led us to this new land, a place of promise and opportunity, far removed from the shadows of our past.\n\nIn the early days, the streets were strange and unyielding, but as the years folded into one another, I found my footing. New friends emerged from the shadows, and with them, new foes. The neighbors were distant, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who dwelled close by. Their kindness was a balm in the wilderness, and I came to hold them dear, like kin. I recall with clarity the day we attended Mr. Glen's wedding anew, a celebration that spoke of hope and renewal. There was joy in the air, and laughter danced in the night as I caught the white garter Ms. Veda tossed. But the flowers eluded me.\n\nThe neighborhood is a labyrinth, its paths winding and secretive, though a GPS now guides my wanderings. My explorations were often shared with Kason and Curtis, comrades in the simple pleasures of youth. Together, we delved into the world of video games and the unhurried joy of existence. The park offered solace, a place where nature whispered calm into my restless soul. There, I practiced balance with sticks from the depot, my wooden sword a companion in the dance of solitude.\n\nCourts of basketball and tennis stood silent, relics of a past when my father and Mr. Graves taught us the game of tennis. The memory of their lessons still echoes, a testament to the sweat and laughter shared. Fun was never in short supply in this place, and though many tales could be told, these are the ones that linger. Yet, I hold a quiet belief that the finest days remain ahead, waiting to unfurl their stories.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town like so many others, yet it calls itself the Peach Capital of the World. Johnston, with its fields rolling out under endless skies, holds its secrets in the soil and the trees heavy with fruit. On the sign that welcomes you, this boast is etched, though the town speaks softly in its quiet way. Here, the earth is parceled into farms where peach trees stand sentinel or cattle graze in languid contemplation. Homes stand apart, two-storied and roofed in metal or shingle, set back from the roads, yielding the front fields to the sun and the rain and the toil of men.\n\nIn the town's heart, a solitary stoplight hangs over a crossroads, casting its red and green eyes upon the few places folks gather. Hong Kong, with its modest offerings from a far land, and Fiesta Mexican, where the air is spiced with distant flavors, and Gary's, a burger chain that spins tales of America on its sizzling grills. Once, a pizzeria served its own kind of alchemy, but its ovens are now cold.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, whose fame rests not on its prescriptions but on the sweet bite of Cherry Coca-Cola, stands alongside the Independent Grocers Alliance, a store known more by its letters, IGA. Though sole in its kind, it sees its patrons more for trifles than for the feast of groceries, who journey instead to Batesburg-Leesville for the abundance of Walmart. Dollar General holds the town's affections, its aisles a march of necessity from dawn till dusk.\n\nIn the corner of this world, Possibilities Furniture & More stands, its keeper a woman whose kindness maps the town. Movers ply their trade under her employ, delivering the promise of comfort to waiting homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to creatures both great and small, offering care and respite.\n\nThe doctor and the vet, each with their small practice, tend to the body and soul of Johnston's creatures. And the young ones learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, until the world calls them to the neighboring town's schools. Parks there are none, but plans are laid for a patch of green where families might gather under the open sky.\n\nFor all its lacks, Johnston holds its charm in its simplicity. A town so small and unassuming, you might pass it by and not know it, a whisper on the wind as you journey on.",
            "In the heart of a small Tennessee town, where the lands stretch out in quiet repose, I find my home nestled in the suburb's embrace, a place where time moves in its own unhurried measure. The street that ties our lives together winds between two state highways, and though the passage of cars is more frequent than my liking, the neighborhood holds its peace like a well-kept secret. The faces here have become familiar, for few come or go, and in their constancy, I find a comfort like the sun's daily return. The people tend to their yards and the small labors of life that stitch the hours together. Winter comes and we take to sledding down the hill, a brief and joyful flight on our side street. Our house stands on the corner, a sentinel watching the comings and goings, and in this way, we know each car and each journey by heart. When a foreign vehicle appears, it is marked by our eyes, as if the land itself notes the intrusion. Neighbors wander the roads, some for the exercise, some led by the leashes of their dogs. Children, with the abandon of youth, weave their bicycles through the air. We remain home more often than not, our work tethered to the house. There are four souls here: myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, growing up in this quiet corner of the world. Our presence is known, just as we know theirs. We play outside, even under the rain's gentle insistence. At times, the back deck becomes an altar to the grill, smoke and scent mingling with the air—a promise of warmth and gathering. The drone of lawnmowers is a constant from March to October, a soundtrack to the growing season. Trees abound, remnants of the woods that once held sway, offering shade in summer and a burden of leaves in the fall, demanding the rake and the fire. I savor the scent of burning leaves, the autumn's signature, though winter comes now as a pale shadow of itself, leaving us with an endless fall. The garage at the back of the house serves as my retreat, a place for the truck and other endeavors, and when the doors swing open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood beat stronger in my veins. Holidays descend with a gentle hush, Thanksgiving's arrival marked by unfamiliar cars crowding the streets as families reunite. Mother’s Day and Christmas bring the same quiet flurry. In all its simplicity, I find I am content here. Were it not for the road that carries strangers through our midst, it would be a perfect place indeed.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where dust and grit lay claim to the earth, my neighborhood sprawls beneath an endless sky. The land here is a tapestry of brown, a harsh and unyielding hue that stretches as far as the eye can see. Only those who've set foot in this place can truly understand the relentless presence of the earth's bare bones. When a patch of green appears, it is a testament to toil and expense, a small rebellion against the desert's dominion. Back in the nineties, the homes were scattered like seeds cast upon the wind, and though the land remains much the same, new structures rise like sentinels of change. The city creeps ever closer, its edges blurring into the desert's vastness, as if it were a living thing, always growing, always hungry. \n\nIn this place, the people are warm and welcoming, but like any city, shadows linger where the sun does not reach. My own corner of this world is watched over by gentle souls, the elders who have seen the sands shift and change. The stores that dot our streets bear familiar names, chains that have planted their roots in this arid soil. For a taste of the finer things, a journey must be made, for here, the likes of Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind. \n\nConstruction reigns as the king of industry, driven by the unquenched thirst for development. The open spaces call to the builders, urging them to transform the desert's face. It is a prospect that fills me with unease; the city I left behind whispers its siren song, and I find no desire to return. My hands find their purpose in the craft of drywall and T-bar, shaping the spaces where others will dwell.\n\nYet amid the encroaching change, the desert offers its own treasures. The creatures that call this harsh land home are a wonder to behold. My children, wild with the joy of discovery, chase lizards and bugs beneath the sun's watchful gaze. The high desert holds its secrets close, a beauty both stark and fragile.\n\nVictorville, with its peculiar charms, offers a taste of the desert's mystery. The San Bernardino County Fair casts its spell each year, a celebration of life beneath the endless sky. Nearby, Wrightwood beckons with its snow-capped peaks, a place where winter's breath can be felt. For those with a thirst for knowledge, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a guardian of stories, its halls echoing with the whispers of the past. Here, the land’s history and culture are laid bare, a testament to the resilience and spirit of this desert world.",
            "The world turns and the sun climbs over the horizon with a light that is ancient and indifferent. When asked to speak of my neighborhood, I reckon my tale might stray from the usual. Others, they might talk of homes with picket fences and the slow pulse of suburban life. My place is different. My neighborhood is a college campus, a sprawl of brick and mortar where the young and the searching gather in dormitories and lecture halls. This is my community, my tribe. The land around it, the campus, it too is my neighborhood, though a bit less so.\n\nIn its essence, my neighborhood is a reflection of the larger world. It has its dwellings, its people, its commerce, and its patches of green where one might find solace. Let me take you through these places. The \"houses\" here, they are of a kind distinct to this place. We have three sorts: the apartments, the houses, and the dormitories. In the apartments, rooms hold two to four souls, and floors stack upon floors, with twenty or so folks in a building. The houses, they stand apart, open to those bound to the school in some way or another. They are few, these houses, a rarity for those from days gone by. But the dormitories, they are the heart. Hundreds of students, each room a shared space, a common kind of living here.\n\nNow, about the people. The school takes pride in the tapestry of its folk. They come from lands far and near, of all ages and stories. The staff, they dwell in the houses, while the new blood fills the dorms, and the older ones find their place in the apartments. Words fall short in capturing their essence. Best to move on to the commerce and the green spaces of my neighborhood.\n\nThis school, it is a world unto itself. Stores line its paths, with food and wares like any town, but also goods marked by the school’s own hand. All that one could need lies within its bounds. And the park, a small oasis, a place where the diverse gather under the open sky. It is kept clean, a testament to the care of the community. This is my neighborhood, and here, all things find their place.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes ever downward and my house clings to the summit of the hill, the steepest in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. The joggers ascend its face each morning, their breath mingling with the fog. The street is without sidewalks and the folk must tread upon the asphalt, pitted and worn, a hazard to both foot and wheel. The wires that net the sky above are frayed and ragged, victims of the storms that rage through this place. The branches and debris strike them down and they rise again patched and piecemeal, a testament to resilience. Tall evergreens stand sentinel all around, their presence loathed by those who yearn for the sea’s expanse. They cut them down, these trees, to clear the path for the eye, to let the ocean’s horizon pour into their glass-fronted homes which rise like sentinels along the hill. At sunset the bay ignites with an inner fire and the sky bleeds orange, though more often the sun hides behind a veil of cloud. The days are gray and wet. Moss creeps where it will, a green shroud upon roofs and cars and railings. I left my car outside once and it grew a pelt of moss in a month’s time. Spent three hours scraping it clean. Children are scarce here though there’s a school just yonder. The old ones dwell in these parts, their days spent in quietude. Dogs abound in place of children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door ajar and they’ll find their way inside. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam as well, their numbers thinned by the relentless hunt of the neighborhood’s cats. The gardeners curse them for the burrows they dig, the roots they sunder. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle driven off by crows. There are no stores here, but down the slope by the water’s edge lie a few eateries where the catch of the day is served. The beach is but a stony shore, yet the rocks invite the hand to cast them into the bay. The water stretches not far, the opposite shore plainly visible even through the mist’s embrace.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there lies a place called Bensonhurst. It is not difficult to find. The public conveyances of New York City will bear you there without fail, for they are many and ceaseless in their comings and goings. Bensonhurst is a place of streets and corners, a place where the city breathes and moves with the rhythm of its own making. As you walk among its lanes, know that you have not left New York City, for it lingers in the very air you breathe.\n\nIn these parts, over the span of two decades, there has been a gathering of peoples from distant shores, and their presence is marked by the shops they have wrought. Each block is testament to their industry—a myriad of Asian-owned establishments, from supermarkets to laundromats, their signs calling out in colors and scripts foreign and familiar. The wares they offer are lauded by those who dwell here, for the quality is high and the price is not dear, and such convenience is a balm to the weary soul.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely of one people. It is a tapestry woven of many threads, immigrants and their children who have taken root in this soil. The businesses that rise and fall in this place are largely Asian-owned, but the people who walk these streets are of all kinds. There is even a park nearby, freshly tended and made anew, where children play and men engage in their games, where the fountains sing of summer, and all manner of folk mingle in the soft light of the evening.\n\nThe skyline is not marred by the towers of commerce, for here the structures are more humble: apartments and houses, places where families find their rest. The air is filled with noise, a cacophony of engines and music, a symphony that plays from dawn till dusk, and it is the song of the city itself.\n\nWhen night falls, carry with you a measure of caution, for though the streets are not perilous, the unknown lurks in the shadows. There are those who would trouble you for their own sport, and there are thieves who covet what is not theirs. I have known the sting of such encounters, though years have passed since then. And there are those who disregard the laws of cleanliness, leaving behind the leavings of their dogs for the unwary to tread upon. It is a trial to keep one's shoes unsoiled in such a place.\n\nSo if you come to Bensonhurst, come with eyes open and feet wary, for the city is a place of many wonders and many trials, and it is a place that will mark you as surely as you mark it.",
            "The first thing you must understand about Portland, Oregon is the nature of its strangeness. Upon the brick facade of a building that dabbles as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music hall, and a den of dubious repute, there is scrawled the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a faint echo of the Portland from the days gone by, a whisper of the city in the nineties and early aughts when it was less charted and less dear, a cradle for peculiar and vibrant subcultures. For others, it is an invitation - come to Portland, where they will call you strange, but with affection. Despite the tide of wealthy Californians and the rising sprawl of condominiums to house them, Portland remains strange. Strange does not mean unconditionally accepting, but it means embracing what the world often shuns. Strange does not imply a lack of modernity or its battles. Like the rest of the nation, we barter for most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be strange, to diverge from the ordinary, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. We have yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals. Perhaps strange means we simply bear all this with less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many of Portland's enclaves, we have houses painted in hues of whimsy, gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the curbs, and in the summer, boxes of giveaways. These free boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold the castaways of another, yet often something magical, a treasure awaiting the wanderer. They mostly contain clothes and books but can surprise with anything. The enchantment of meandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one thread in a tapestry of peculiarity. Some folks I share this city with would never deign to pluck their garments from a roadside box. They find solace in goat yoga or at the Timbers’ roar. Portland brims with souls who love all manner of things. Portland is a city of dreamers, whether chasing those dreams or dreaming of chasing them while the nights slip away at the bar. Yes, there is a shadow of addiction here. Such shadows often cast their roots in the soil of mental unrest, and the unending rain and brooding skies seem to play their part. Portland grapples with homelessness as well, a plight without easy remedy. The homeless are drawn by what services the city can muster, services that outshine much of the nation, yet fall short as they do everywhere. The housed waver between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not strange at all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s pilgrimage across the heavens at dawn and dusk. No matter how the world forgets them or how the tides of toil and life may pull me away, they remain, unyielding, untouched by the fleeting woes of men. On days when the weight of the world bears down upon me, they call out for my gaze, and as I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, lending me strength to press forward, one day at a time. It was when I first came here for my studies that I found my eyes drawn to the northern peaks that watched over the campus. True, the university boasts its own share of splendor in its edifices and waters and groves, which hold a part of my affection, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my heart. The town itself is lovely in its way. There are countless cafés where hours of caffeine-driven study took place. One might walk or take the bus a short distance to the downtown, where the air hangs heavy with the past, in the faded bricks of eateries and offices. Here, this seeming suburb stirs with as much life and vigor as the nearby city. Yet, this bustle is but a brief affair, for one might slip away again into the quietude of the town with a mere pass by the library. This close juxtaposition of worlds lends the city a certain enchantment, inviting exploration. Thus, it is simple to weave many a fond memory, each tied to a corner of the town. Whether it be strolling past rusted swings in the park with friends after a night unended or racing through the vibrant downtown to catch a film at the grand theater courtesy of university tickets. But it is also a place of bitter recollections, as all locales inevitably are in the weave of life. The ponds, especially, serve as mirrors for contemplation and the occasional tearful vigil at two in the morning amid an existential storm. The latter, I know too well. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects live their tiny dramas, each with a part to play, I pondered my own purpose as I navigated the enigma of existence. So I walked past the pond and the park and the little houses that spoke of suburbia until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its golden light upon the palms, painting the sky, and as I lifted my gaze to the dawn, I knew I was walking north. And sure enough, they were there, as they had ever been. The steadfast mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more surely than any structure on the horizon, and as if through a silent language, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the first glance it might be a place you'd pass by unseeing. It's just a residential block tucked behind the strip of stores, not the kind of place one thinks of people making their homes. Yet homes they are. You head past the vacant Whole Foods, past the hotels that see life only in brief summer flares for family gatherings, and there you find the stirrings of a community. The streets hold the apartments, each one laid out in a deliberate line like dolls from a wooden set, each one taken apart and laid side by side, piecemeal. The first you see are the ones that have found their names in the news, unsavory tales that cast long shadows, but we won't linger there. For beyond them, the other complexes open into a world unknown to the wider town. Across, a community college's satellite campus stands with quiet dignity, its structures calm in their vigil by the roadside. The students come in their morning stupor, clutching coffees, yawning their way through the iron gates that open with a groan, while the commuters curse and moan, held back in the rush of a crowded morning. Where the road meets another, it finds a park on one edge and a rehab center on the other, where the broken make their slow recoveries. The center lays out its cheerful furniture under the slow churn of a ceiling fan, pushing the summer's heavy air back and forth. Over in the park, children tumble through the grass, bees linger over flowers, while old folks trail their dogs, casting wary eyes at the skateboarders and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground, their talk of boys and the latest on YouTube. There’s a sushi joint in the strip mall next to the park, its food cheap, its tables rarely full. Next to it, a swimming supply store and a nail salon, a trifecta where you might attend to your pool, your nails, and your hunger all at once. The frozen yogurt shop stands there too, teenagers wandering out with sweating cups, covered in every imaginable topping, skateboarding and vaping with the air of those who think it makes them cool. This neighborhood, it's a stitch in the fabric of America, a piece of history in the drowsy South where nothing ever seems to change, not even time itself.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a testament to times bygone, its homes mostly single-family affairs, though a few have been cleaved in twain and yet remain bound, if sense can be made of such contrivance. My own dwelling sits with a small yard before it, a modest driveway to its left, akin to most others here, calling forth memories of an era when suburban life was the very heart of the American dream. A dream that once cradled the nation close but now drifts ever so slightly from our grasp. Yet these neighborhoods endure, whispering still to those who wander through them that the dream lives on, an echo of hope in a world grown indifferent. The folk here, they don't hold the hope they once did, the neatness of their lawns waning with the years. Still, cars nestle in driveways, and the children play as though the world beyond held no sway over their small lives. The public school, nearing its ninetieth year, stands as a relic and a promise, sparking futures in the young and nostalgia in the old. Churches scatter sparsely, their pews empty, but the courts ring with the sound of basketball games. Each house bears its own visage but shares a common soul. There's a supermarket named Super A, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs in this place where most faces are African American. The streets spread wide, a field for children’s games, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Generations have rooted here, weaving stories of a time when every neighbor was known, when a karate school thrived until the allure of Hollywood's martial tales waned, leaving behind a pharmacy in its stead, for medicine, it seems, is the solace now sought. A small theater, too, clings on, offering old films to those who cherish them, the youth's disdain leaving it untroubled by crowds, a retreat for the elders who value its modest price for an evening’s respite. An expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies beyond our borders. A petition once rose to claim an exit for our place, championed by the young, yet the elders, fearing the change it might herald, swayed the council to let it pass unheeded. A new high school rises, and the question of a mascot lingers. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin backdrop might suit this peculiar town just fine.",
            "In the sprawl of this vast city where the land stretches and bends under the weight of its own making, the neighborhood stands as a testament to the ceaseless dance of diversity. Here, the residential quarters scatter like leaves in the wind, interspersed among the bustling commerce of human enterprise. Offices rise alongside shops and eateries and places where music and laughter spill into the night air like whispers of a bygone era. There is no end to the newness of flavors and wares that tempt the wanderer’s heart. The grand emporiums of well-hewn brands stand shoulder to shoulder with the small boutiques that charm the passerby with their quaint allure. They hug the streets, threading through the city like veins, reaching into neighborhoods that might once have known the quiet of a gentle dawn but for the clamor of life that surrounds them.\n\nAnd there are parks, too. The earth there is well-trodden by the feet of young children and their guardians who seek respite under the canopy of ancient trees. The people themselves, they are a tapestry of the world. In one corner, an LGBTQ+ community thrives, while the traditions of Orthodox Jews echo through another. Refugees and immigrants from the old lands of the Soviet Union carve out their space, their stories weaving into the fabric of this place. Beyond these streets, the city unfurls into Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and the like—each its own universe, each just a stone’s throw away yet sometimes a journey of hours due to the serpentine traffic that grips the city in its iron grasp. Though the distances are not great, the time spent among the choked paths of asphalt is interminable. Feet rarely touch the ground here, for the city sprawls too wide, its veins clogged with the metal and exhaust of vehicles seeking a path through its heart.\n\nThe irony of construction rises like a specter, for in this place where space is scarce, new towers climb skyward in defiance of the crowded streets below. The city draws them in, but its residents gaze upon the growing skyline with trepidation, knowing well the burden of more souls and more machines. Yet, not all dwell within these monoliths. Homes diverse as the city itself dot the landscape: houses, small apartments, and condos, single-family dwellings beside duplexes. Even in this, there is diversity. The neighborhood breathes with lives of all ages, though the days of familiarity with those who live next door seem a distant memory. Childhood echoes with laughter in the streets, the shadows of friendships cast long ago, when the world seemed smaller and simpler. Now, it is a place of strangers, each living within their own story, the threads of which seldom intertwine.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we drove through the cornfields that stretched to the horizon like the boundless sea. This is it I said and I saw the surprise in her eyes at the vastness of it all. She came from a place where the grocery store was a short walk from her door and never had she seen such openness. The endless fields of corn rose and fell like waves and I told her of life in rural Ohio and she began to understand who I was and where I had come from. We traveled down a two-lane country road past a quarry filled with water, and beyond that lay the small development I called home. The houses were of brick and stucco, each set upon a generous half acre, and the folks there took pride in their land. Springtime brought a riot of flowers and the trees that lined the streets changed with the seasons as if to mark the passage of time. The driveways sparkled with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming under the sun after a wash. As we neared my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was in his yard as always, with a smile on his face. He spent the days mowing his lawn, singing above the drone of his John Deere, and though he was a source of amusement to many, he was genuine and his past was rich with stories. Once a doctor, now he seemed to merge with the grass and the machine he rode. We came to my house at last. In the side yard, geese wandered and our Terrier gave chase. Behind the house, a stream fed the quarry, and there you could hear the call of bullfrogs, the murmur of water, and the distant lowing of cows from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis of trees and wildflowers, where I spent my childhood days. We built forts among the branches and chased the animals, a game we called hunting. There was always something to do, a friend to find. Winters here were harsh but held a beauty all their own. The green yard turned to a wilderness, the trees stripped bare by the cold. When snow fell, it cloaked the land in a silent wonder. My sister's snow angels dotted the ground, and snowmen stood guard. We fought as siblings do, with snowballs for weapons, and built forts of snow and branches to defend ourselves. In that snowy world, we played pretend, children without a care, lost in the magic of the moment."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way.

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Out in the heart of Rural America, in a small township of Michigan, the land stretches from the fields to the sparse tourist havens. Here, there are no sprawling malls, no Wal-mart nor Target, not even a solitary Applebee’s to mark the landscape. Every venture requires the road beneath your wheels. Yet, these lands are graced with a beauty that the world seldom knows, bordered by water, where the expanse of Lake Michigan meets with Lake Charlevoix. The very air is laced with the scent of distant waters, and beaches lie waiting for those who seek them. This neighborhood holds the spirit of the small town, where homes do not crowd upon one another but stand in their own time-worn grace. They are no mere replicas, these houses, but individual in their history and bearing. Some wear the marks of age and some the touch of renewal. Basements lie beneath them, full and visible from the roadside. The aluminum siding of old endures on many a home, and the palette of colors echoes through the blocks. Yards stretch out with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences holding back the small lives within. It is Middle America, where folks labor for their keep, raising their families or remembering when they did. Children’s laughter spills into the streets, mingling with the sound of dogs and the whisper of wheels on pavement. Neighbors nod to neighbors, knowing who belongs and who does not. A man might stand by his grill and wave, or a passerby with a dog might offer a smile. The lawns are tended, leaves long gone with the fall, and the grass remains green and clipped. The plants and bushes, they too are kept in their place. This is no neighborhood of grandeur, but one where a life might be well lived, its quiet and peace a balm. It is average, yet within this ordinariness lies the extraordinary, a place of safety at day's end. A short walk leads to the sheriff’s office, the jail, and the health department, all settled in their places. The recycling center down the road serves the people, and beyond, the fields of play where the voices of announcers drift on the air. The small-town airport lies beyond, its engines a distant rumble. Ice cream waits at the local stand, and downtown is close enough if you’ve a mind to walk. The park is a mere eight blocks away, where children ride their bikes and laughter fills the air. Truly, it is a place worthy of calling home.",
            "In the place where I make my home, the world is carved out in neat rows and lines, a testament to the artifice of men. It bears the mark of suburban design, each house a mirror to its neighbor, each street a tale of symmetry enforced by the iron hand of the homeowner's association. As you cross the threshold into this realm, the houses stand in their sanitized glory, their facades polished by the relentless insistence of the association. The lawns are a testament to uniformity, each a small green patch bordered by stones, the driveways brief and indistinct. Now and again, a tree rises, though small and sparse, as if hesitant to break the mold.\n\nGarages yawn wide enough for two cars, and the roads, they gleam with the sheen of fresh concrete, unmarred by the wounds of time and neglect. The houses, mostly single-storied, rise occasionally to two, but never so much as to disrupt the horizon. Here, the mail does not come to the door but sits in clustered boxes at the street's end, keys the only means of entry, the HOA's creed of sameness etched into every detail.\n\nWe lie on the city's edge, straddling the line between the rural and the suburban, land stretching wide and open. Pools and paths, the bounty of community planning, invite the residents to linger, to wander without leaving the bounds of this well-tended enclave. It's a place where folks, mostly those who've seen the years pass by, find safety and solace, their lives intertwined in quiet harmony. A few younger souls pepper the landscape, professionals carving out their own paths in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond, vast in number but not in spirit, holds its own peculiar charm. It offers what you need and maybe more, a single mall the heart of commerce, modest in size but ample in purpose. Fifteen minutes on the road and you're met with myriad choices, from grocers of refinement to shops of austerity. Here, the neighborhood stands, a testament to safety and maintenance, a slice of the ordinary rendered in the language of man's design, where the pools reflect the sky and the trails lead you home.",
            "The first whisper of my place came to me through the ether of a podcast, a tale spun of the vanished, and it sat uneasy in the mind. Surprising it was, amid these apartments priced dearer than gold it seemed, each one a thousand dollars and more for the mere privilege of sleep. No recollection of such stories had ever crossed my ears, nor those of my friends. Perhaps it was the struggle that bound us, those nights when tears fell unbidden from eyes accustomed to the hard truths of frugality. The years had taught us a sharpness, a way to find solace in the scent of toys long forgotten and clothes buried in mothballs. The smells of adulthood, they fade and blur, smoking out the edges of memory until only dust and time remain. Flea markets, they always break through, their scent of age and life insistent like old magazines piled high upon a forgotten piano. The dust settles deep into leather, a stubborn guest refusing eviction. \n\nHere the thrifts are three, each within steps of the other, a pilgrimage of sorts. A walk that takes you through charity’s embrace, the whisper of books long out of print, and the oddities of a curio shop. Downtown swells with the tide of cars and people, a river of life that flows unceasingly, yet within the thrifts, silence reigns. The world outside may clamor, but here the quiet holds sway, a sanctuary for the lost hours of an afternoon. \n\nEvery year the city swells, its arteries clogged with the pulse of progress, this place they say is burgeoning, clutching at the hems of a digital empire vast and sprawling. It brings to mind the old city, New York, where the multitudes pursue their solitary purposes and ask little from you save to leave them be. Here, anonymity is a right, an unspoken pact. Unlike the South, where concern weaves through the fabric of civility, here the shell is yours to keep, the city indifferent as the tide, crashing and receding against the shore of your solitude. \n\nYet for all its modern sprawl, life persists in the spaces between. A pianist next door, voices raised in song from above, a symphony of life in the midst of concrete. It’s less an apartment of strangers, more a tapestry of lives intertwined. We gather, we celebrate, we mourn, we help. In this, luck finds me, wrapped in the kindness of neighbors who reach out as I do in return. We share the small acts of living, the mail, the meals, the presence that reassures. It is they who remind me that in this vast expanse of steel and stone, I have not lost myself entirely.",
            "I dwell in a modest town laid upon the plains of the Midwest, just beyond the reach of a sprawling city. On the eastern fringe of this town lies my neighborhood, a place where the weight of economic hardship settles like dust. The houses here stand as humble sentinels, their worth measured in the currency of struggle, owned or rented by souls who bear the burden of scant means. Yet, it is not a place stripped of beauty or bereft of spirit. Walk the streets and you'll find faces turned to you in greeting, a community bound by the thin thread of shared existence. Crime does cast its shadow, darker here than other quarters, but still it is a shadow not yet monstrous. In the past decade, violence has visited these streets, leaving behind echoes of gunfire and the cold silence of loss. Our neighbors next door, their son claimed by a bullet outside a dim-lit bar just last year. By grace or fortune, our family has been spared such direct sorrow, save for the petty theft of forgotten items on our porch. The town bears the scars of a wider plague, the scourge of opioids that has swept across this land. Lives have been claimed by the insidious grip of fentanyl, but in this place, there is a flicker of resistance. Resources stand ready, addiction centers and Narcan trainings offering a lifeline to those teetering on the edge. Despite the shadows, this town holds its virtues. My son's elementary school, a beacon of hope, staffed by those who nurture with compassion. Even with his special needs, he finds no torment here, only acceptance in an atmosphere charged with positivity. The PTO, ever industrious, orchestrates gatherings to weave families into the fabric of education. Hunger finds no purchase here, with meals freely given to all, a testament to the town's refusal to let poverty strip dignity from its children. The City Council, in its wisdom, has sought to polish the face of our town, roads renewed and parks reborn, though these efforts lean westward, leaving our side of town to languish. This neglect breeds discontent among us who dwell in its shadow. Yet, I find contentment in this place. The people, warm and genuine, the schools a nurturing ground, and the shops, both quaint and grand, suffice for our needs. Our home, though modest in worth, cradles us in comfort. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere is but a whisper in the wind.",
            "In the hills where my home lies, there's a tapestry of the past woven into every corner. The neighborhood sits upon a rise, and its structures speak in whispers of the old world. Seven stories tall, my apartment stands across from a theater that once breathed life, and down the slope rests a curious arcade bar, drawing a medley of souls when the summer's breath is warm. On weekends in the heart of June and July, a line snakes out, folk eager for the revelry within. Nearby, the city park sprawls, its breadth surprising for its place among the urban sprawl. Encircling it is the gray of concrete, steps molded into its face. Winter comes with a bite, and the unsheltered erect their camps in orderly rows along those steps, the chill biting but less so for the closeness. The rain falls more than snow, and in those torrents of midwinter, warmth is a fugitive thing. But the heart of the city is nearer than the wilderness, and the sanctuary of a family center beckons, offering a place to wash away the grime.\n\nYet it is not the beauty of architecture or the proud history that holds me. It is the spirit of the people that binds me to this place. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, known for blood and violence on the western shores. The tales linger, ghostly echoes of federal forces sweeping through like a storm to cleanse the streets. Memories persist, passed down like heirlooms, even to newcomers like me. The labor of the people is unending, their hands worn from striving to transform what was once notorious. They hold a fierce pride, a vigilance over their domain. Whispers caution the pale-skinned to tread lightly after dusk, a relic of bygone days, stained with the bitterness of old prejudices. Perhaps my complexion shields me, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, a witness to the scars that mar our land. Scars of bigotry, of ingrained fear and ignorance, even in a city that fancies itself a mosaic of cultures. But in my heart, I know: the Hilltop is my anchor. In the night, I walk those streets, alive and unafraid, met with kindness more often than malice. A place of small mercies, where doors stay open a moment longer for refuge from the storm. Where strangers pause, see me in my solitude, and offer a word of grace, a reminder of worth amidst the gloom.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unyielding. At first, friends were hard to come by, but soon enough, I found kinship with a boy two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of road. They've both moved on, but the echoes of our shared days linger, like whispers caught in the wind. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived have stayed, their lives threading through the fabric of this place like the steady ticking of a clock. This neighborhood is much like any American suburb, with its rows of two-story houses standing sentinel under the wide sky. \n\nOn weekends, or whenever the sun graces us with its warmth, the laughter of children rises up, a bright chorus against the quietude that fills the weekdays. Here, folks leave you be unless need calls them to your side. Not once has a package vanished from my porch. There's a trust among us that feels as solid as the earth beneath our feet. Just down the way, a park beckons, a mere minute's walk from my door. It's a place heavy with memories, of games played and friendships forged. There, too, is the memory of a football game that left me with a bloodied nose, a sharp reminder amid the softer recollections. Now, the park is a playground for my cousin's young ones, their delight in swings and slides a testament to the simple joys that endure. \n\nThe park draws from me a deep nostalgia, a longing for days past. This neighborhood is a tapestry of cultures, with flavors from Chinese to Indian, Mexican to Italian, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the ease of modern life has many turning to the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash, though fast food reigns supreme as it does in most suburban sprawls. Pizza joints abound, each with its own claim to fame. The stores here cater to every need, from dry cleaners to the familiar glow of Walgreens and CVS. Jewel-Osco stands as a beacon of Midwestern commerce. Among the stores, an Indian-owned shop offers the spices and flavors of home for those who seek it.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The tales of discord and strife in other neighborhoods, shared across the digital ether, only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find among these quiet streets.",
            "The college stands not far from my dwelling and for this I take comfort in its proximity, the neighborhood a tapestry of apartment blocks and the odd establishment where one might find diversion or drink without ruinous expense. A bar has changed its name and with it the price of entry, though the quality holds its own. The folk here are of two sorts, students mostly or those of modest means, the rent a mercy to the latter. Children abound, drawn by the nearby elementary, their laughter a constant chorus beneath the trees that crowd the grounds of my abode. I know not the people who share these walls, nor do I wish to. Their smoke seeps through the halls and in response the management has mounted a contraption to mask the scent, a gesture both absurd and amusing to my companion and me. The buildings stand with age upon them, their facades weary though the interiors may surprise. Down the way rise new edifices, but they are no better for their youth, hastily erected and demanding a sum none should pay. There is a place to eat where the fare comes on paper and the microwave hums in the kitchen, the opposite a gas station where work is not for the faint of heart. The city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a path wide enough for two abreast and soft with grass at its edges. Yet the place I call home is cloaked in trees, their numbers diminished but still they stand sentinel. Behind, another street runs parallel, though it shows a rougher face, the walkways crumbling and the edifices in disrepair. Trees here serve as a shield, their shade covering the flaws. Crime has made its mark, more on the street behind than here, yet it is not an isolated blight. Across the way lies a haunt of transient souls and troubles aplenty. Still, I find a liking for my corner of the world. It is within my means and serviceable, the university a short stroll and the buses waiting to ferry me to the heart of the town or the market as needed.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of a cul-de-sac, a clutch of duplexes painted all the same yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, set down among fields and trees like a small village lost in time. There was a sense of kinship among those who lived here, neighbors gathering in the evenings at the edge of someone’s driveway, watching children with their kites and chalk, as if the world outside had ceased its relentless pace. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast, the clouds a billowing white. Yet even here the world could not be kept at bay. Tornado warnings had scattered the tranquility, the sirens calling out in the night like some ancient lament. I found myself curled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, clutching purse and pillows as the hail battered the earth outside. My larger dog refused the sanctuary, pacing the living room with nervous barks. The aftermath left the roads steaming, the temperature falling from sweltering to cool in the span of moments. As the clouds parted, the sun spilled through and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with those far away. The neighborhood held its breath a while longer before life returned to its habitual rhythms, mothers calling children to dinner, the air filled with the scent of cooking. \n\nFor one who has recently moved from the granite hills of New Hampshire to this North Carolina hamlet, the southern drawl is a song unto itself. The homes are outwardly identical, two bedrooms and two baths, yet within them, they differ. Some are small to the point of puzzlement. I wander the field behind my home, path leading to a pond where deer sometimes gather and in the morning the bullfrog sings his deep song. It is a place removed, yet close enough to Charlotte that the city’s reach is felt. Each day begins with the crow of roosters from surrounding farms, the evenings echo with the bray of a donkey from a nearby farm. It is a strange grace to have stumbled upon such a haven.",
            "In the long expanse of time, ten years seems a blink, yet here I am with the dust settled upon the memories of my coming. There was a sadness when I first set foot in this place, a melancholy that clung like the morning fog. From Riverdale to Stockbridge, I journeyed, and tears were my companion, for I left behind the familiar, the beloved. My parents, seeking what was best for me and my sister, led us to this new land, a place of promise and opportunity, far removed from the shadows of our past.\n\nIn the early days, the streets were strange and unyielding, but as the years folded into one another, I found my footing. New friends emerged from the shadows, and with them, new foes. The neighbors were distant, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who dwelled close by. Their kindness was a balm in the wilderness, and I came to hold them dear, like kin. I recall with clarity the day we attended Mr. Glen's wedding anew, a celebration that spoke of hope and renewal. There was joy in the air, and laughter danced in the night as I caught the white garter Ms. Veda tossed. But the flowers eluded me.\n\nThe neighborhood is a labyrinth, its paths winding and secretive, though a GPS now guides my wanderings. My explorations were often shared with Kason and Curtis, comrades in the simple pleasures of youth. Together, we delved into the world of video games and the unhurried joy of existence. The park offered solace, a place where nature whispered calm into my restless soul. There, I practiced balance with sticks from the depot, my wooden sword a companion in the dance of solitude.\n\nCourts of basketball and tennis stood silent, relics of a past when my father and Mr. Graves taught us the game of tennis. The memory of their lessons still echoes, a testament to the sweat and laughter shared. Fun was never in short supply in this place, and though many tales could be told, these are the ones that linger. Yet, I hold a quiet belief that the finest days remain ahead, waiting to unfurl their stories.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town like so many others, yet it calls itself the Peach Capital of the World. Johnston, with its fields rolling out under endless skies, holds its secrets in the soil and the trees heavy with fruit. On the sign that welcomes you, this boast is etched, though the town speaks softly in its quiet way. Here, the earth is parceled into farms where peach trees stand sentinel or cattle graze in languid contemplation. Homes stand apart, two-storied and roofed in metal or shingle, set back from the roads, yielding the front fields to the sun and the rain and the toil of men.\n\nIn the town's heart, a solitary stoplight hangs over a crossroads, casting its red and green eyes upon the few places folks gather. Hong Kong, with its modest offerings from a far land, and Fiesta Mexican, where the air is spiced with distant flavors, and Gary's, a burger chain that spins tales of America on its sizzling grills. Once, a pizzeria served its own kind of alchemy, but its ovens are now cold.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, whose fame rests not on its prescriptions but on the sweet bite of Cherry Coca-Cola, stands alongside the Independent Grocers Alliance, a store known more by its letters, IGA. Though sole in its kind, it sees its patrons more for trifles than for the feast of groceries, who journey instead to Batesburg-Leesville for the abundance of Walmart. Dollar General holds the town's affections, its aisles a march of necessity from dawn till dusk.\n\nIn the corner of this world, Possibilities Furniture & More stands, its keeper a woman whose kindness maps the town. Movers ply their trade under her employ, delivering the promise of comfort to waiting homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to creatures both great and small, offering care and respite.\n\nThe doctor and the vet, each with their small practice, tend to the body and soul of Johnston's creatures. And the young ones learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, until the world calls them to the neighboring town's schools. Parks there are none, but plans are laid for a patch of green where families might gather under the open sky.\n\nFor all its lacks, Johnston holds its charm in its simplicity. A town so small and unassuming, you might pass it by and not know it, a whisper on the wind as you journey on.",
            "In the heart of a small Tennessee town, where the lands stretch out in quiet repose, I find my home nestled in the suburb's embrace, a place where time moves in its own unhurried measure. The street that ties our lives together winds between two state highways, and though the passage of cars is more frequent than my liking, the neighborhood holds its peace like a well-kept secret. The faces here have become familiar, for few come or go, and in their constancy, I find a comfort like the sun's daily return. The people tend to their yards and the small labors of life that stitch the hours together. Winter comes and we take to sledding down the hill, a brief and joyful flight on our side street. Our house stands on the corner, a sentinel watching the comings and goings, and in this way, we know each car and each journey by heart. When a foreign vehicle appears, it is marked by our eyes, as if the land itself notes the intrusion. Neighbors wander the roads, some for the exercise, some led by the leashes of their dogs. Children, with the abandon of youth, weave their bicycles through the air. We remain home more often than not, our work tethered to the house. There are four souls here: myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, growing up in this quiet corner of the world. Our presence is known, just as we know theirs. We play outside, even under the rain's gentle insistence. At times, the back deck becomes an altar to the grill, smoke and scent mingling with the air—a promise of warmth and gathering. The drone of lawnmowers is a constant from March to October, a soundtrack to the growing season. Trees abound, remnants of the woods that once held sway, offering shade in summer and a burden of leaves in the fall, demanding the rake and the fire. I savor the scent of burning leaves, the autumn's signature, though winter comes now as a pale shadow of itself, leaving us with an endless fall. The garage at the back of the house serves as my retreat, a place for the truck and other endeavors, and when the doors swing open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood beat stronger in my veins. Holidays descend with a gentle hush, Thanksgiving's arrival marked by unfamiliar cars crowding the streets as families reunite. Mother’s Day and Christmas bring the same quiet flurry. In all its simplicity, I find I am content here. Were it not for the road that carries strangers through our midst, it would be a perfect place indeed.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where dust and grit lay claim to the earth, my neighborhood sprawls beneath an endless sky. The land here is a tapestry of brown, a harsh and unyielding hue that stretches as far as the eye can see. Only those who've set foot in this place can truly understand the relentless presence of the earth's bare bones. When a patch of green appears, it is a testament to toil and expense, a small rebellion against the desert's dominion. Back in the nineties, the homes were scattered like seeds cast upon the wind, and though the land remains much the same, new structures rise like sentinels of change. The city creeps ever closer, its edges blurring into the desert's vastness, as if it were a living thing, always growing, always hungry. \n\nIn this place, the people are warm and welcoming, but like any city, shadows linger where the sun does not reach. My own corner of this world is watched over by gentle souls, the elders who have seen the sands shift and change. The stores that dot our streets bear familiar names, chains that have planted their roots in this arid soil. For a taste of the finer things, a journey must be made, for here, the likes of Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind. \n\nConstruction reigns as the king of industry, driven by the unquenched thirst for development. The open spaces call to the builders, urging them to transform the desert's face. It is a prospect that fills me with unease; the city I left behind whispers its siren song, and I find no desire to return. My hands find their purpose in the craft of drywall and T-bar, shaping the spaces where others will dwell.\n\nYet amid the encroaching change, the desert offers its own treasures. The creatures that call this harsh land home are a wonder to behold. My children, wild with the joy of discovery, chase lizards and bugs beneath the sun's watchful gaze. The high desert holds its secrets close, a beauty both stark and fragile.\n\nVictorville, with its peculiar charms, offers a taste of the desert's mystery. The San Bernardino County Fair casts its spell each year, a celebration of life beneath the endless sky. Nearby, Wrightwood beckons with its snow-capped peaks, a place where winter's breath can be felt. For those with a thirst for knowledge, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a guardian of stories, its halls echoing with the whispers of the past. Here, the land’s history and culture are laid bare, a testament to the resilience and spirit of this desert world.",
            "The world turns and the sun climbs over the horizon with a light that is ancient and indifferent. When asked to speak of my neighborhood, I reckon my tale might stray from the usual. Others, they might talk of homes with picket fences and the slow pulse of suburban life. My place is different. My neighborhood is a college campus, a sprawl of brick and mortar where the young and the searching gather in dormitories and lecture halls. This is my community, my tribe. The land around it, the campus, it too is my neighborhood, though a bit less so.\n\nIn its essence, my neighborhood is a reflection of the larger world. It has its dwellings, its people, its commerce, and its patches of green where one might find solace. Let me take you through these places. The \"houses\" here, they are of a kind distinct to this place. We have three sorts: the apartments, the houses, and the dormitories. In the apartments, rooms hold two to four souls, and floors stack upon floors, with twenty or so folks in a building. The houses, they stand apart, open to those bound to the school in some way or another. They are few, these houses, a rarity for those from days gone by. But the dormitories, they are the heart. Hundreds of students, each room a shared space, a common kind of living here.\n\nNow, about the people. The school takes pride in the tapestry of its folk. They come from lands far and near, of all ages and stories. The staff, they dwell in the houses, while the new blood fills the dorms, and the older ones find their place in the apartments. Words fall short in capturing their essence. Best to move on to the commerce and the green spaces of my neighborhood.\n\nThis school, it is a world unto itself. Stores line its paths, with food and wares like any town, but also goods marked by the school’s own hand. All that one could need lies within its bounds. And the park, a small oasis, a place where the diverse gather under the open sky. It is kept clean, a testament to the care of the community. This is my neighborhood, and here, all things find their place.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes ever downward and my house clings to the summit of the hill, the steepest in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. The joggers ascend its face each morning, their breath mingling with the fog. The street is without sidewalks and the folk must tread upon the asphalt, pitted and worn, a hazard to both foot and wheel. The wires that net the sky above are frayed and ragged, victims of the storms that rage through this place. The branches and debris strike them down and they rise again patched and piecemeal, a testament to resilience. Tall evergreens stand sentinel all around, their presence loathed by those who yearn for the sea’s expanse. They cut them down, these trees, to clear the path for the eye, to let the ocean’s horizon pour into their glass-fronted homes which rise like sentinels along the hill. At sunset the bay ignites with an inner fire and the sky bleeds orange, though more often the sun hides behind a veil of cloud. The days are gray and wet. Moss creeps where it will, a green shroud upon roofs and cars and railings. I left my car outside once and it grew a pelt of moss in a month’s time. Spent three hours scraping it clean. Children are scarce here though there’s a school just yonder. The old ones dwell in these parts, their days spent in quietude. Dogs abound in place of children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door ajar and they’ll find their way inside. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam as well, their numbers thinned by the relentless hunt of the neighborhood’s cats. The gardeners curse them for the burrows they dig, the roots they sunder. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle driven off by crows. There are no stores here, but down the slope by the water’s edge lie a few eateries where the catch of the day is served. The beach is but a stony shore, yet the rocks invite the hand to cast them into the bay. The water stretches not far, the opposite shore plainly visible even through the mist’s embrace.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there lies a place called Bensonhurst. It is not difficult to find. The public conveyances of New York City will bear you there without fail, for they are many and ceaseless in their comings and goings. Bensonhurst is a place of streets and corners, a place where the city breathes and moves with the rhythm of its own making. As you walk among its lanes, know that you have not left New York City, for it lingers in the very air you breathe.\n\nIn these parts, over the span of two decades, there has been a gathering of peoples from distant shores, and their presence is marked by the shops they have wrought. Each block is testament to their industry—a myriad of Asian-owned establishments, from supermarkets to laundromats, their signs calling out in colors and scripts foreign and familiar. The wares they offer are lauded by those who dwell here, for the quality is high and the price is not dear, and such convenience is a balm to the weary soul.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely of one people. It is a tapestry woven of many threads, immigrants and their children who have taken root in this soil. The businesses that rise and fall in this place are largely Asian-owned, but the people who walk these streets are of all kinds. There is even a park nearby, freshly tended and made anew, where children play and men engage in their games, where the fountains sing of summer, and all manner of folk mingle in the soft light of the evening.\n\nThe skyline is not marred by the towers of commerce, for here the structures are more humble: apartments and houses, places where families find their rest. The air is filled with noise, a cacophony of engines and music, a symphony that plays from dawn till dusk, and it is the song of the city itself.\n\nWhen night falls, carry with you a measure of caution, for though the streets are not perilous, the unknown lurks in the shadows. There are those who would trouble you for their own sport, and there are thieves who covet what is not theirs. I have known the sting of such encounters, though years have passed since then. And there are those who disregard the laws of cleanliness, leaving behind the leavings of their dogs for the unwary to tread upon. It is a trial to keep one's shoes unsoiled in such a place.\n\nSo if you come to Bensonhurst, come with eyes open and feet wary, for the city is a place of many wonders and many trials, and it is a place that will mark you as surely as you mark it.",
            "The first thing you must understand about Portland, Oregon is the nature of its strangeness. Upon the brick facade of a building that dabbles as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music hall, and a den of dubious repute, there is scrawled the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a faint echo of the Portland from the days gone by, a whisper of the city in the nineties and early aughts when it was less charted and less dear, a cradle for peculiar and vibrant subcultures. For others, it is an invitation - come to Portland, where they will call you strange, but with affection. Despite the tide of wealthy Californians and the rising sprawl of condominiums to house them, Portland remains strange. Strange does not mean unconditionally accepting, but it means embracing what the world often shuns. Strange does not imply a lack of modernity or its battles. Like the rest of the nation, we barter for most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be strange, to diverge from the ordinary, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. We have yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals. Perhaps strange means we simply bear all this with less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many of Portland's enclaves, we have houses painted in hues of whimsy, gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the curbs, and in the summer, boxes of giveaways. These free boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold the castaways of another, yet often something magical, a treasure awaiting the wanderer. They mostly contain clothes and books but can surprise with anything. The enchantment of meandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one thread in a tapestry of peculiarity. Some folks I share this city with would never deign to pluck their garments from a roadside box. They find solace in goat yoga or at the Timbers’ roar. Portland brims with souls who love all manner of things. Portland is a city of dreamers, whether chasing those dreams or dreaming of chasing them while the nights slip away at the bar. Yes, there is a shadow of addiction here. Such shadows often cast their roots in the soil of mental unrest, and the unending rain and brooding skies seem to play their part. Portland grapples with homelessness as well, a plight without easy remedy. The homeless are drawn by what services the city can muster, services that outshine much of the nation, yet fall short as they do everywhere. The housed waver between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not strange at all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s pilgrimage across the heavens at dawn and dusk. No matter how the world forgets them or how the tides of toil and life may pull me away, they remain, unyielding, untouched by the fleeting woes of men. On days when the weight of the world bears down upon me, they call out for my gaze, and as I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, lending me strength to press forward, one day at a time. It was when I first came here for my studies that I found my eyes drawn to the northern peaks that watched over the campus. True, the university boasts its own share of splendor in its edifices and waters and groves, which hold a part of my affection, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my heart. The town itself is lovely in its way. There are countless cafés where hours of caffeine-driven study took place. One might walk or take the bus a short distance to the downtown, where the air hangs heavy with the past, in the faded bricks of eateries and offices. Here, this seeming suburb stirs with as much life and vigor as the nearby city. Yet, this bustle is but a brief affair, for one might slip away again into the quietude of the town with a mere pass by the library. This close juxtaposition of worlds lends the city a certain enchantment, inviting exploration. Thus, it is simple to weave many a fond memory, each tied to a corner of the town. Whether it be strolling past rusted swings in the park with friends after a night unended or racing through the vibrant downtown to catch a film at the grand theater courtesy of university tickets. But it is also a place of bitter recollections, as all locales inevitably are in the weave of life. The ponds, especially, serve as mirrors for contemplation and the occasional tearful vigil at two in the morning amid an existential storm. The latter, I know too well. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects live their tiny dramas, each with a part to play, I pondered my own purpose as I navigated the enigma of existence. So I walked past the pond and the park and the little houses that spoke of suburbia until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its golden light upon the palms, painting the sky, and as I lifted my gaze to the dawn, I knew I was walking north. And sure enough, they were there, as they had ever been. The steadfast mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more surely than any structure on the horizon, and as if through a silent language, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the first glance it might be a place you'd pass by unseeing. It's just a residential block tucked behind the strip of stores, not the kind of place one thinks of people making their homes. Yet homes they are. You head past the vacant Whole Foods, past the hotels that see life only in brief summer flares for family gatherings, and there you find the stirrings of a community. The streets hold the apartments, each one laid out in a deliberate line like dolls from a wooden set, each one taken apart and laid side by side, piecemeal. The first you see are the ones that have found their names in the news, unsavory tales that cast long shadows, but we won't linger there. For beyond them, the other complexes open into a world unknown to the wider town. Across, a community college's satellite campus stands with quiet dignity, its structures calm in their vigil by the roadside. The students come in their morning stupor, clutching coffees, yawning their way through the iron gates that open with a groan, while the commuters curse and moan, held back in the rush of a crowded morning. Where the road meets another, it finds a park on one edge and a rehab center on the other, where the broken make their slow recoveries. The center lays out its cheerful furniture under the slow churn of a ceiling fan, pushing the summer's heavy air back and forth. Over in the park, children tumble through the grass, bees linger over flowers, while old folks trail their dogs, casting wary eyes at the skateboarders and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground, their talk of boys and the latest on YouTube. There’s a sushi joint in the strip mall next to the park, its food cheap, its tables rarely full. Next to it, a swimming supply store and a nail salon, a trifecta where you might attend to your pool, your nails, and your hunger all at once. The frozen yogurt shop stands there too, teenagers wandering out with sweating cups, covered in every imaginable topping, skateboarding and vaping with the air of those who think it makes them cool. This neighborhood, it's a stitch in the fabric of America, a piece of history in the drowsy South where nothing ever seems to change, not even time itself.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a testament to times bygone, its homes mostly single-family affairs, though a few have been cleaved in twain and yet remain bound, if sense can be made of such contrivance. My own dwelling sits with a small yard before it, a modest driveway to its left, akin to most others here, calling forth memories of an era when suburban life was the very heart of the American dream. A dream that once cradled the nation close but now drifts ever so slightly from our grasp. Yet these neighborhoods endure, whispering still to those who wander through them that the dream lives on, an echo of hope in a world grown indifferent. The folk here, they don't hold the hope they once did, the neatness of their lawns waning with the years. Still, cars nestle in driveways, and the children play as though the world beyond held no sway over their small lives. The public school, nearing its ninetieth year, stands as a relic and a promise, sparking futures in the young and nostalgia in the old. Churches scatter sparsely, their pews empty, but the courts ring with the sound of basketball games. Each house bears its own visage but shares a common soul. There's a supermarket named Super A, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs in this place where most faces are African American. The streets spread wide, a field for children’s games, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Generations have rooted here, weaving stories of a time when every neighbor was known, when a karate school thrived until the allure of Hollywood's martial tales waned, leaving behind a pharmacy in its stead, for medicine, it seems, is the solace now sought. A small theater, too, clings on, offering old films to those who cherish them, the youth's disdain leaving it untroubled by crowds, a retreat for the elders who value its modest price for an evening’s respite. An expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies beyond our borders. A petition once rose to claim an exit for our place, championed by the young, yet the elders, fearing the change it might herald, swayed the council to let it pass unheeded. A new high school rises, and the question of a mascot lingers. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin backdrop might suit this peculiar town just fine.",
            "In the sprawl of this vast city where the land stretches and bends under the weight of its own making, the neighborhood stands as a testament to the ceaseless dance of diversity. Here, the residential quarters scatter like leaves in the wind, interspersed among the bustling commerce of human enterprise. Offices rise alongside shops and eateries and places where music and laughter spill into the night air like whispers of a bygone era. There is no end to the newness of flavors and wares that tempt the wanderer’s heart. The grand emporiums of well-hewn brands stand shoulder to shoulder with the small boutiques that charm the passerby with their quaint allure. They hug the streets, threading through the city like veins, reaching into neighborhoods that might once have known the quiet of a gentle dawn but for the clamor of life that surrounds them.\n\nAnd there are parks, too. The earth there is well-trodden by the feet of young children and their guardians who seek respite under the canopy of ancient trees. The people themselves, they are a tapestry of the world. In one corner, an LGBTQ+ community thrives, while the traditions of Orthodox Jews echo through another. Refugees and immigrants from the old lands of the Soviet Union carve out their space, their stories weaving into the fabric of this place. Beyond these streets, the city unfurls into Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and the like—each its own universe, each just a stone’s throw away yet sometimes a journey of hours due to the serpentine traffic that grips the city in its iron grasp. Though the distances are not great, the time spent among the choked paths of asphalt is interminable. Feet rarely touch the ground here, for the city sprawls too wide, its veins clogged with the metal and exhaust of vehicles seeking a path through its heart.\n\nThe irony of construction rises like a specter, for in this place where space is scarce, new towers climb skyward in defiance of the crowded streets below. The city draws them in, but its residents gaze upon the growing skyline with trepidation, knowing well the burden of more souls and more machines. Yet, not all dwell within these monoliths. Homes diverse as the city itself dot the landscape: houses, small apartments, and condos, single-family dwellings beside duplexes. Even in this, there is diversity. The neighborhood breathes with lives of all ages, though the days of familiarity with those who live next door seem a distant memory. Childhood echoes with laughter in the streets, the shadows of friendships cast long ago, when the world seemed smaller and simpler. Now, it is a place of strangers, each living within their own story, the threads of which seldom intertwine.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we drove through the cornfields that stretched to the horizon like the boundless sea. This is it I said and I saw the surprise in her eyes at the vastness of it all. She came from a place where the grocery store was a short walk from her door and never had she seen such openness. The endless fields of corn rose and fell like waves and I told her of life in rural Ohio and she began to understand who I was and where I had come from. We traveled down a two-lane country road past a quarry filled with water, and beyond that lay the small development I called home. The houses were of brick and stucco, each set upon a generous half acre, and the folks there took pride in their land. Springtime brought a riot of flowers and the trees that lined the streets changed with the seasons as if to mark the passage of time. The driveways sparkled with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming under the sun after a wash. As we neared my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was in his yard as always, with a smile on his face. He spent the days mowing his lawn, singing above the drone of his John Deere, and though he was a source of amusement to many, he was genuine and his past was rich with stories. Once a doctor, now he seemed to merge with the grass and the machine he rode. We came to my house at last. In the side yard, geese wandered and our Terrier gave chase. Behind the house, a stream fed the quarry, and there you could hear the call of bullfrogs, the murmur of water, and the distant lowing of cows from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis of trees and wildflowers, where I spent my childhood days. We built forts among the branches and chased the animals, a game we called hunting. There was always something to do, a friend to find. Winters here were harsh but held a beauty all their own. The green yard turned to a wilderness, the trees stripped bare by the cold. When snow fell, it cloaked the land in a silent wonder. My sister's snow angels dotted the ground, and snowmen stood guard. We fought as siblings do, with snowballs for weapons, and built forts of snow and branches to defend ourselves. In that snowy world, we played pretend, children without a care, lost in the magic of the moment."
