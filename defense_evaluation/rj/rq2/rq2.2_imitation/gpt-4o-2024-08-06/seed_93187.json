            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a small town in Michigan, where the road stretches from vast farmlands to quaint tourist cities. It is a place devoid of sprawling malls or the bright lights of Wal-mart, Target, or even the humble glow of an Applebee’s. Here, the open land demands you drive to your destination, yet it is a place of untouched beauty, wrapped in the embrace of water. My town, if you can call it that, finds itself nestled between the grand expanse of Lake Michigan and the serene waters of Lake Charlevoix. Shores stretch out, inviting the weary to rest their feet in the cool embrace of the sand and surf.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks in the quiet tongue of small-town life. Houses stand apart, not the uniformity of modernity but relics of a bygone era, some tended to with care, others left to the ravages of time. Full basements peer from beneath the ground along the streets, and aluminum siding glints under the sun. The spectrum of home colors paints the blocks in a myriad of hues, each with a yard where children’s laughter echoes from trampolines and playsets. Gardens grow in the care of those who tend to them, fences keep the animals safe. It is the visage of Middle America, where laboring hands strive to carve out a living, nurturing the young or reflecting on the past.\n\nIn this place, the streets are alive with the patter of children’s feet, the bark of a dog, the hum of bicycles and rollerblades. Neighbors nod in recognition, a silent understanding of who belongs. A grill sends up smoke as a friendly wave passes between strangers, a smile exchanged from afar. Lawns are kept neat, leaves banished, the grass a verdant carpet beneath the feet. It may not be a neighborhood that inspires awe, but it is a sanctuary, a haven for families to grow and find their peace. The quiet speaks volumes; it is a place of safety, a refuge at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, the health department its neighbor, and the recycling center serves the community’s needs. The crack of bat against ball echoes from fields where children play, their names called out by unseen voices. And the small town airport, where the roar of engines shatters the silence, planes climbing into the open sky. Ice cream waits within walking distance, a sweet reward for those who venture downtown. Eight blocks away, the park welcomes my children’s bikes. It is a place of simple joys and unassuming grace, a good place to call home.",
            "In the land where the houses stand in neat rows like sentinels of some forgotten order, there lies the neighborhood that wears the face of the commonplace. A suburbia wrought by the hand of uniformity, sculpted under the stern eye of the homeowner's association. Upon entry, you are greeted by the unyielding symmetry of manicured lawns and homes that whisper the same secrets, each with a patch of green, some stones scattered like the memories of lost landscapes, and driveways that stretch briefly from street to home. The trees, sparse and deliberate, stand as if planted by some ancient decree. Each domicile boasts a garage for two, a testament to the lives within.\n\nAs you traverse this place, the roads, smooth as a river's stone, bear no blemish nor scar. The asphalt, unmarked by time's passage, speaks of a relentless upkeep that defies the entropy of the world beyond. The houses, mostly of a single story, rise occasionally to two, breaking the horizon like the quiet rise of a thought unspoken. Mailboxes do not stand solitary at the curb but gather at the street's end in a cluster, a congregation of metal that demands a key for entry, parcels held in lockers as if secrets kept by the community itself.\n\nThe boundary of this neighborhood lies at the edge of the city's reach, a place where the rural and the suburban converge, giving rise to expanses of land that invite the wanderer to walk its paths. Pools, gated and pristine, lie in wait for those who seek solace in their waters. Trails wind through the community, offering the promise of solitude or the company of a faithful hound at one's side. Here, exercise needs no park, for the neighborhood is vast enough to hold your running feet.\n\nThe souls who dwell here are mostly those who have seen the seasons turn many times, retirees who watch over one another with a quiet vigilance. Yet, among them, the young professionals and the middle-aged find their place, adding their stories to the tapestry of life here. The city nearby, a paradox of size and intimacy, offers its bounty of amenities. A single mall stands as the heart of commerce, modest in size but sufficient to the needs of those who seek its wares. Fifteen minutes by car will take you to any place of note, where high-end grocers share space with outlets of frugality, each with their own tale to tell.\n\nAnd so this place, safe and tended with care, holds within it the trappings of a familiar life. The pools and trails, the order and the quiet, all speak of a world crafted for comfort. Though the shopping lies a journey away, it is but a small price for the peace this land bestows.",
            "The first I’d heard of the place was listening to some broadcast about lost souls. It caught me off guard, unexpected like. Every flat around here runs up past a thousand a month and nobody ever spoke of such tales, not to me or any of the folks I knew. Maybe it’s the struggle. I know some who cry themselves to sleep, though they won’t say it. The cost of things bears down hard but we’ve learned to scrape by. You come to embrace the scent of old toys and clothes kept from the moths. You find yourself smelling less as the years weigh in. Maybe you take up smoking or maybe you just grow used to the way of things. But the flea market stands its ground. The odor of grown days is dusty stacks of magazines on a silent piano. It settles in the leather and stays there even after washing. Around here, three thrift stores lie within strolling distance. Start on the far side and you’ll see two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book shop, and a curio store. Downtown’s tight with cars and bodies, filling the streets at dawn, but you’d never hear them in the thrifts. No matter the passing crowd or traffic, the place holds its hush. It’s a fine spot to let the afternoon slip away. Each year brings more of those. Cars and people flood the city. They say it’s growing, a city in the throes of change. Headquartering a vast online empire for commerce and delivery, still showing the ache of growth. It calls to mind New York. Every soul bent on their own path, not much asked of you. Alone you can be, quiet, independent, and the world leaves you be. Not like the South, where concern shows you care. Here, no life is pried into. You keep your shell as long as you need, and the city rolls back like the tide. Lively place. With a pianist next door and two singers upstairs, there’s always something stirring. In some sense, it’s less a flat of strangers and more a kinship of friends. We gather for needs, mark birthdays, mourn farewells, lend a hand where we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Neighbors mostly good folk, and they treat me right. I clean up, leave them food, and they do the same. Carry mail back and forth. Nice to see them, and I think they find my company pleasing as well. I dwell in this vast, cold modern sprawl yet it’s folks like my neighbors that make me think I ain’t gone and wrecked my life.",
            "In the heartland where the land sprawls out like an old quilt, patched and mended, there lies a town caught on the edge of the city’s reach, where the concrete gives way to fields and the promise of quiet. I make my home on the eastern side of this town, a place where the dollar stretches thin and the roofs sit low under the weight of time. The houses, humble in their wearing, stand as if in quiet defiance, occupied by those who find their footing on the margins. Yet the streets are not without their grace, and the folks here, they nod and tip their hats, a silent kinship exchanged among strangers.\n\nThe specter of crime lingers at the edges, a whispered tale of the past decade: a scattering of violence, the crack of a gunshot in the night, the grief of a mother next door whose boy fell to the dark outside a bar. We’ve been spared, mostly, save for a trinket or two vanished from the porch when the dusk cloaks the world. The town bears the scars of a greater curse, an epidemic of powdered despair that steals breath and life, fentanyl its name, carving holes in families and futures. Yet here, against the tide, rise centers of hope, places of healing, where Narcan finds its way into hands ready to save.\n\nAmidst the trials, the town stands resilient, its virtues steadfast. My son finds sanctuary in the schoolhouse, where the walls echo with laughter and learning, untouched by cruelty despite the challenges he bears. The teachers, the principal, they form a bastion of goodwill and care, ushering each child with a gentle hand. The PTO breathes life into the halls, crafting moments of joy and togetherness. Poverty casts its shadow, yet no child feels its chill; meals are given freely, dignity preserved.\n\nThe council speaks of progress, their hands busy with the town’s face-lift, though their gaze seldom shifts eastward. Here on our side, the roads remain cracked, the parks overgrown, promises whispered but not kept, a thorn in the side of those who call this place home. Yet in spite of it all, I find solace here. The people, they are kind; the shops, sufficient; the life, enough. Our home, its worth measured not in gold but in comfort, stands as testament to sixteen years of roots sunk deep into this soil. And here, in this town, we remain, unable to picture a life beyond its borders.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like some ancient thing, its bones wrapped in a shroud of history, buildings stacked with tales long told. I make my home in a seven-story edifice that stands sentinel across from the old theater where echoes linger. Down the slope, a block away, there's a small arcade bar where souls gather, drawn into its warmth like moths to a flame on summer's breath. On those nights, lines snake along the pavement, a testament to the life that pulses here.\n\nA few blocks further, the city park unfolds itself, a vast expanse of green framed by stone and concrete, steps hewn into its sides like scars. In the cold grip of winter, the homeless set their tents in rows, a testament to the struggle against the chill and the rain that falls relentless from a brooding sky. They huddle close, seeking warmth and solace in the heart of the city, not out in the wilderness where the jungle waits. The family center, a beacon of respite, lies within reach, offering the gift of warmth and water.\n\nYet it is not the storied architecture or the whispers of history that bind me to this place. It is the people, the culture that throbs within. Hilltop, once a name feared, a place of violence and dark tales, still breathes its stories. The streets remember the sweep of authority, the cleansing that left only memories behind. The people hold onto these tales, passing them down like heirlooms, marking the passage of time and change.\n\nThey labor still to cleanse their streets, to nurture their home. They speak of caution, of danger after dark, warnings flavored by the past, by the fears that linger. Perhaps my skin, shaded just enough, finds acceptance here, or perhaps they see in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history's burden, the shadows cast by ignorance and fear. This city, a supposed haven of diversity, still struggles with the ghosts of division.\n\nYet the Hilltop is my anchor, my home. In its embrace, I walk the night, alive and unafraid. Here, kindness finds me more often than malice. Strangers offer warmth where coldness might dwell. Laundromats remain open, their lights a refuge against the storm. And on the bleakest of nights, I find myself seen, valued by the tender act of a stranger’s hand.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when words fell flat against the hardness of new faces. Friends were hard to find. I found them nonetheless, a boy two doors down and another further along the street. They've long since moved, but the echoes of our days never left. Most folks who were here when I arrived remain as if time has held them in its quiet embrace. The place is like any other stretch of suburban America, two-story houses standing watch over their little plots of earth. Come the weekend or any warm day, the air fills with the laughter of children, yet the quiet holds its dominion through the week. There's a peace here, an understanding that a man is left to his own unless he seeks aid. Packages arrive on the doorstep and stay unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds the neighbors.\n\nA park lies a minute's walk from my door, a small green world of memory. There, I played basketball and football, the crack of the bat echoing in the evenings. It was there, too, that I took an elbow to the nose, a painful reminder that not all memories are sweet, yet the good far outweigh the bad. Now, when I wander that way, it is with my cousin's young ones, their eyes bright with the thrill of swings and slides. That park stirs something deep, a well of nostalgia that flows unbidden.\n\nThe neighborhood, a tapestry of faces and flavors. Within a mile, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare mingle in the air. Yet the world shifts, and convenience rules the day. GrubHub and DoorDash ferry meals to doorsteps, though the golden arches still beckon as they do in every suburb. Pizza abounds, a staple of American life. The stores, they offer all one might need. Dry cleaners dot the area, and there's a Walgreens and a CVS standing sentinel on the same street. Jewel-Osco, a beacon of the Midwest, serves the community's needs. Even diversity finds its place, an Indian-owned store offering spices and meals to those who seek them.\n\nIn all, I hold my neighborhood dear. The tales of neighborly strife that ripple across the digital world make me thankful for the peace that surrounds me. Here, in this quiet solace, I find contentment.",
            "The place where I live rests close by to the college I attend, and for this reason I find some contentment in dwelling there. The neighborhood is a patchwork of apartment buildings, with a scattering of eateries and bars that offer diversion without draining the purse too severely. One bar has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though its offerings and service aren't the worst one might find. The populace is generally of a decent sort. You'll find college youth mingling with those of humbler means, drawn by the affordability of the housing. Children abound, owing to the elementary school within a stone's throw from my abode. The neighbors remain strangers to me, and I prefer it so. They indulge in the smoking of weed, prompting the management to install an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing to the point of insult. The buildings around me bear the marks of age, though some may conceal renovated hearts. Further down the way stand newly minted apartments, but I hold them in low regard, knowing the shoddy craftsmanship that raised them. They charge dear for rent, a swindle made permissible by their proximity to the campus. There's a nearby eatery, cheap and cheerful, serving its fare on paper plates and warming meals by microwave. Across from it lies a gas station, reputedly a poor place of employment. Yet last summer saw the city bestow funds to refurbish the road, laying down a broad sidewalk with green medians, lending the area a touch of grace. My apartment is cloaked in trees, though a few have been felled, leaving stumps like gravestones. More trees shade my street than the road beyond. Behind my complex lies a tree line, then another spread of apartments. I reside on 42nd street; 43rd looms behind, less comely with sidewalks crumbling and buildings in disrepair. Trees line this street as if to hide its blemishes. Crime finds a home in a nearby complex and across the way, where residents come and go like whispers on the wind. Yet I find some fondness for where I dwell. It's within my means, and the conveniences it offers are ample. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops grant swift passage to the store and downtown.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled across the cul-de-sac like a tale half-told, duplexes scattered with the care of a child's hand arranging a toy village. Each building stood painted in a uniform yellow, with white porches and green roofs of metal that gleamed in the sun, giving them an appearance of singular homes though they were not. In this cluster of sameness, a kinship had formed among most, though not all, neighbors. As the day waned, we gathered, unbidden, at the end of a driveway to exchange words that floated on the warm air while children played out their own worlds with chalk and kites beneath a sky vast and blue, the clouds drifting like old ships in calm seas. It was here, in this place, that the noise of the modern world receded, a step back into a time less hurried.\n\nBeyond us lay fields and trees, their green depths touched by the sky's endless blue. But with the season came the threat of storms, and the night before had brought the wail of tornado sirens, the first I'd ever heard. We sought shelter, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and a purse filled with the little comforts of life, as the larger one barked his fear to the quiet room from the living room. The storm passed, leaving the ground littered with hail that sang its cold song as it melted away. The air, suddenly cool, steamed from the heat it had known moments before. In the aftermath, as the sun broke through and rain fell from a clearing sky, a double rainbow arced above, a promise painted in light. I seized my camera, captured the scene, and shared it with those who would marvel at such wonders, as did I. The street lay silent still, until life resumed its steady pace, mothers and children emerging as the evening meal cooked inside.\n\nI had come here, a stranger from the north, to find a community that spoke in a tongue soft with the southern drawl, a two-bedroom apartment like the others yet distinct within. Some were small, defying reason, but mine was a good fit. Behind stretched a vast field, and beyond that a pond where deer wandered and bullfrogs sang in the dawn. It was a place that felt remote, yet lay but forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Roosters heralded the mornings, their calls mingling with the bray of a distant donkey, a reminder of the farms that circled us like sentinels of a bygone era. Here, in this corner of the world, I had found a place to call home.",
            "I reckon it's been near a decade I've walked these streets and breathed the air that fills this place. A soul can't help but gather tales to tell. When I first set foot in this neighborhood, sorrow was my shadow. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore me up inside. I cried for the days left behind, the faces I loved. My folks, they sought a better life for me and my sister. So we moved, chasing better houses and finer schools, places folks called not ghetto. As time unspooled, I grew accustomed to the new horizon. Made friends, made enemies too, in the halls of that school. The neighbors, they stayed distant save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis, who lived right nearby. They became family in ways unspoken, and I hold them dear. I recall the day when me and my kin went to Mr. Glen’s wedding—his re-marrying. Joyful it was, a harbinger of dreams I keep for myself, to one day shower my own bride with the life of royalty. When Ms. Veda tossed that white garter, it was my hand that caught it. But the flowers eluded me. We danced till the stars blinked out, and I remember the laughter shared with Marsharii, but she's a ghost now, gone on her way. The neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, but with a GPS in hand, I wander its paths. I've ventured far only with Kason and Curtis, comrades in games and in life. We reveled in the simple things, the fleeting joys of youth. At times, I'd find solace in the park, nature's balm on a restless spirit. With sticks from the Home Depot, I'd practice balance, wield my bokken wooden sword. It's a joy that remains untouched by time. There's a court for basketball and tennis too, though it's been a spell since I laid hand to racket or ball. My dad, he nurtured a love for tennis in me and my friend alongside Mr. Graves, who pushed us hard, but we laughed all the way through. This place holds a tapestry of memories, and while many stories dwell here, these are the ones that linger, whispering of the promise the future holds untold.",
            "The town lies quiet beneath the Carolina sun, a modest settlement not marked by grandeur but by the silent labor of its fields. Johnston, they call it, the Peach Capital of the World, and the sign at the edge of it declares this proudly to any who might pass by. Farmland stretches out from the heart of the town, where peach trees stand in orderly rows and cattle dot the landscape like slow-moving shadows. Homes scatter themselves across this expanse, solitary and spaced, two-story structures with roofs of metal or gray shingle to beat back the heat of a relentless summer. They sit back from the road, yielding the front lands to the hands of farmers and the tread of beasts.\n\nIn the town’s small core, a single stoplight dangles above the crossroads, marking the place where commerce takes what little root it can. There are but a few places to find a meal prepared for you—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese kitchen, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger joint. A pizzeria once graced this town, but it shuttered its doors in the recent past. Maxwell and Halford Drug stands, a tiny pharmacy with a reputation more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its remedies. The Independent Grocers Alliance, known simply as IGA, is the lone grocery store, but many make the journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General is the lifeblood of the town’s commerce, its aisles crowded from dawn to dusk with those seeking the essentials of life.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More sits under the stewardship of a kind-hearted woman, her store a fixture of the community with two men employed to deliver the wares. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town’s pets with care, offering grooming and shelter in equal measure. A doctor’s office and a veterinary practice both lie beyond the town’s center, small yet sufficient to the needs of the people. Johnston Elementary School is where the young learn their letters and numbers until such time they must travel to the next town for further schooling.\n\nNo parks grace this place, though plans are afoot to carve out a space for families, a 2.5-acre hope for the future. The town lacks theaters and alleys of bowling, lacks places for children to play or for folks to gather. Yet there is a quiet charm to it, a simplicity that might be missed if you blink as you pass through, but for those who stop long enough to see, Johnston is a place where the world slows and one can breathe.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I dwell in a modest suburb. A street that stretches between two state highways, it draws more traffic than one might hope for, yet the neighborhood holds its quietude like a secret. The folks here, they don’t come and go much. I've come to know the rhythm of their lives, the hum of their daily labors, the yardwork that keeps them occupied. Winter finds us sledding down the hill on our side street, a brief, cold reprieve from the sameness of days. Our house sits at the corner, a sentinel that watches over all who pass by. Familiarity breeds with each car that rolls by, though a stranger's vehicle is noted with a certain curiosity. \n\nSome neighbors take to walking, a habit of health or necessity, dogs in tow. Children weave through the quiet on their bicycles. We, too, are at home more often than not, the nature of our work binding us to this place. My wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, have woven ourselves into the fabric of this street’s daily life. We venture out for play, unbothered by rain. The grill on the back deck sends up smoke and scent, a signal of small happiness. And there is the ever-present sound of lawn mowers from spring till the grass ceases its growth in October. Trees abound, remnants of an older forest, granting shade in summer and a cascade of leaves in fall, demanding the annual ritual of rake and burn. The scent of burning leaves, it’s the harbinger of autumn’s arrival.\n\nWinter has been scarce of late, stretching the fall into a long, unbroken pause. Our garage faces the back, so the front door sees little use unless a visitor calls, a rarity. I occupy myself with tasks in the garage, the truck and other projects, and with doors open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays pass quietly, Thanksgiving bringing a scattering of distant kin and their vehicles, a similar scene on Mother’s Day and Christmas. This place, I find a fondness for it. Were it not for the cars that hurry through, it might be nigh unto perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert sits a neighborhood of dust and earth, where the land stretches barren and brown under a relentless sun. Those who have not walked its parched ground cannot fathom the oppression of such a monochrome world, save for the rare oasis of green where a man has surrendered riches to coax life from the soil. When I first came here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide, a testament to solitude. Even now, with the new structures rising, the essence remains. The sprawl speaks of a city, yet it mirrors the change found in all places. People here bear warmth in their hearts, though shadows linger as in any town. My own corner of this desert is surrounded by kindly elders, marking it a refuge of sorts. The commerce of this place is dominated by familiar names, chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For the finer things, one must journey afar, for Whole Foods and their ilk are strangers here. Construction reigns in the trade of men, for this city is a canvas yet to be filled, its expanses inviting the hand of progress. This prospect unsettles me, for I cherish the present state, having fled the clamor of a metropolis and unwilling to return. I labor in this field, a craftsman of drywall and T-bar, marking my days with the rhythm of creation.\n\nYet the land holds its own allure, a sanctuary for creatures adapted to its harsh embrace. The desert's stark beauty draws souls seeking its truth, its challenging ecosystems demanding respect for coexistence. We, too, have found our place among the wild things, my children captivated by lizards and the myriad insects of the sands. Even as I write, their laughter echoes outside as they pursue their quarry. Our town offers its diversions, a taste of adventure in the embrace of Victorville. It is a haven for families, the desert unfolding its mysteries. Plan to visit when the San Bernardino County Fair enlivens the air, offering a Victorville welcome. Venture to nearby Wrightwood, where snow-capped peaks promise lessons in winter's arts. For those drawn to the origins of this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands with its relics of geology and ancient peoples, chronicling the tale of Victorville's rise from the dust.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, I reckon my answer might strike as peculiar. Where others might speak of picket fences and lawns, I speak of a place more transient and yet, for a time, eternal. The college campus where I bide my days, it is the land I call home, and the souls within the dormitory walls, they are my kin. Beyond them lies the campus, which sprawls like a yard untamed, a neighborhood in its own right, though lesser and more diffuse.\n\nYet here lies the truth of it: my neighborhood, though strange, is not so unlike those places people call home. It has its own houses, its own people, its own shops and parks. Let me take you through the houses that stand in this peculiar quarter. Three sorts there are—apartments, true houses, and those dormitory halls. In the apartments, they stack folk two or four to a chamber, with four to six chambers a floor. Two stories they rise, and twenty souls they hold, give or take.\n\nThen there are the houses, proper homes for those bound to the school, mostly alumni, who dwell within their two to four room confines. But scarce are these, scattered few across the land, for they are not efficient. Last, there are the dormitories—long corridors lined with rooms where hundreds of students abide. In each, two share a space, for the most part, and these dorms are the heart of my neighborhood.\n\nNow with the houses spoken for, let us turn to the people. The school takes pride in its diversity, and it is here, in the faces you meet in the halls and on the paths. From all lands and ages they come, making this place a tapestry of the world. The staff, they find shelter in the scattered houses, while new students fill the dorms and the older ones take to the apartments.\n\nAs for the stores and the parks, these too are part of my world. The campus is a town unto itself, with a bounty of shops and one lone park. There are places to eat, as there are in any town, and stores with the school’s own wares. In this neighborhood, whatever you seek is within reach. The park, a small respite, is a haven where all gather, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who dwell here.",
            "In the place where I reside, sidewalks are few and far between. The land falls away, giving itself to gravity, and my dwelling stands at the pinnacle of the steepest incline that the local folk know as the \"work out hill,\" for it beckons those who seek to test their mettle upon its slope. No sidewalks grace our street, so the people walk upon the asphalt, where the road is rough-hewn and treacherous to traverse. The wires of telephone and electric strung overhead hang in tatters, battered by the gales and storms that sweep through our land, leaving branches and debris to fell them time and again, their repair a patchwork quilt of human endeavor. Towering evergreens cast their long shadows all around, yet they are not cherished. No, the folk here wield their axes against them, for they covet the view of the sea, unbroken and vast. Thus, the houses rise high upon the hillside, glass-fronted and lofty, seeking the bay's embrace. At day's end, the sun kindles the water, and the heavens burn with orange, though oftentimes the clouds conspire to shroud that celestial fire. The days are gray and wet, and moss clings to all it can, to roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, I left my automobile idle in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it wore a green and furry coat of moss that took three hours to scrape clean. Here, children are scarce, though a school lies but a few blocks distant. My neighbors are mostly of the older sort, many having surrendered to retirement. In place of children, they keep dogs. You’ll see them lounging on lawns or racing down the street, and woe to those who leave a door or window ajar, for the dogs will venture in unbidden. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it back out. Rabbits run rampant, too, some well-sized, much to the chagrin of the gardeners, who curse their burrows and their plundering of roots. My cats, they delight in the chase and have driven most rabbits from our midst. Birds are plentiful, flitting sparrows and hummingbirds, and now and then a hawk or eagle will appear, only to be chased away by the crows that rule the sky. Shops do not dwell here, but down the hill at the water’s edge, a few eateries serve the bounty of the sea. The beach is scant, but the rocks along the shore are fit for casting into the depths, and the bay is narrow; you can glimpse the far shore even through the mist that clings like a shroud most days.",
            "If you find yourself bound for Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, know that you will not struggle to find your way. The city’s arteries of steel and rail run deep and wide, carrying the masses to and fro with the ceaseless clamor of New York’s own breath. Bensonhurst stands proudly urban, its streets echoing the same rhythms that pulse through the heart of the city itself. And as you wander those streets, your eyes will fall upon the myriad Asian shops that have taken root. In the passing of two decades, the neighborhood has welcomed an influx of Asian souls, their presence marked by the scent of spice and the hum of commerce. Every block tells the tale, a testament to the supermarkets and laundromats that dot the landscape, serving the people with the nourishment they seek and the cleanliness they crave. The food is good, the prices fair, and the convenience unrivaled. Just beyond where I stand, four Asian markets lie clustered within two minutes' walk of each other, each a beacon of sustenance.\n\nYet do not let it be said that Bensonhurst is solely a haven for the Asian community. It is a mosaic, diverse and sprawling, with immigrants and their children, first and second generation, weaving the rich tapestry of life here. The businesses, large and small, speak of Asian ownership, yet they coexist alongside a recently renewed park, a refuge of play and sport. There, the earth is marked with ten basketball courts, a broad field for soccer or baseball, and courts for handball, swings, and a playground for the young ones. Even a fountain stands to bring joy in the heat of summer. The park is a testament to the city’s diversity, where all manner of folk gather and find common ground.\n\nThe skyline here is not pierced by the monoliths of corporate ambition, but rather by dwellings of cooperative living and condominium stature. Predominantly, it is a place of two-family homes, where life unfolds with a certain clatter. The people are kind, though their voices are loud. The air is filled with the roar of engines and the thrum of music as cars pass by, relentless and waking the dawn. Should your visit find you beneath the night’s cloak, be wary. The neighborhood, though safe, is unpredictable as the city’s own soul. Trouble may arise unbidden, in the form of bullies or thieves. I have felt it myself in years past, the sting of assault, and more recently, the theft of parcels. Such is the way of things. And though the city demands cleanliness, the rule is oft ignored. The morning light reveals the neglect, the dog waste that mars the path to the train or the market. It is a vexation, an affront to the senses, and one must tread carefully to keep their shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, a town known to some as a bastion of oddity, there lies a truth about the very notion of \"weird.\" Scrawled upon the brick of a building that harbors a pizza joint, bar, music hall, and strip club, a phrase boldly declares, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To the few who remember, it calls back to the Portland of another time, a place less exposed to the world, where creativity roamed untethered in the shadows of the 90s and early 2000s. To others, it is a siren’s song, a lure to a city where the label of weird is worn like a medal of honor. Despite the tide of Californians with their gilded pockets and the rise of glass towers to shelter them, Portland remains untamed. Weirdness here does not always mean open arms, but rather an embrace of the unorthodox. It does not shun modernity, nor its struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we trade with the far East, our goods shipped from China’s distant shores. There are countless ways to be strange, to deviate from the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. It has yoga studios, hipsters, and men in suits. Perhaps being weird is simply to gaze upon all this with a wry smile. In my part of town, as in many corners of Portland, houses stand adorned in hues of the rainbow, gardens spill their bounty onto the sidewalk, and free boxes appear with the sun. These boxes, often simple cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold within them the magic of serendipity, offering treasures to the passerby. They brim with clothes, books, and sometimes the unexpected. This simple wonder of wandering the streets of Southeast Portland is the essence of the city, at least to me, though I am but one peculiar soul among many. Among us are those who would never dream of fetching garments from a box left on the curb. These folks linger at goat yoga—yes, the mats shared with bleating companions—or cheer at Timbers matches. Portland is a mosaic of passions, of dreams pursued or merely contemplated over drinks in dimly lit bars. It harbors a malaise of substances, a shadow cast by the mind’s turmoil, perhaps nurtured by the unending rain and the oppressive gray of the sky. Homelessness is another specter that haunts the city, a dilemma unsolved, despite the services that outshine much of the nation. The housed oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not so peculiar after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, ever present in the north, bearing silent witness to the sun's pilgrimage at dawn and dusk. No matter the forgetfulness of men or the ceaseless pace of their lives, they remain steadfast, untouched by the brief tribulations that consume us. And on those days when the weight of the world bears down and the soul strains under its yoke, the mountains call out with a quiet insistence. They compel the eyes to look upon them, and in that gaze, there comes a balm for the anxious spirit, a quiet fortitude to endure another day. I came to this land as a young scholar, my heart and mind drawn to the mountains that stood sentinel to the north of the campus. The university, with its grand buildings and serene ponds, has its own allure, but it is the mountains that hold dominion over my heart. The town itself carries a humble beauty. Countless cafés have played host to hours of study beneath the caffeinated haze. One can wander or take the bus to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper tales of old. Here, this suburban place hums with the vigor of its urban neighbor, though the thrumming energy fades as you pass the library and find yourself once more in the quiet embrace of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city a mysterious charm, beckoning the curious to explore its depths. Thus, it is easy to craft memories, each tied to a corner of the town. Be it the rusted swings in the park swaying in the night wind or the race through the bustling streets to catch a film at the grand theater. Yet, as with all places, it holds its share of harsh memories. The ponds, reflections of the soul, serve as sanctuaries for solitude or tears shed in the hours when time seems to stand still. Here, in the company of turtles and ducks and insects, all fulfilling their purpose, I ponder my own role in this vast enigma called life. I walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that breathe suburbia, until the street unfurls before me. The sun casts its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky with its brilliance, and I realize my footsteps take me northward. And there, as always, are the mountains. Majestic and unwavering, they brush against the sky, a testament to endurance that speaks to the heart without uttering a word.",
            "It might escape your notice at first, the way things do when they are not meant to be seen or when they hide in plain sight. A residential sprawl tucked behind the commerce of consumption and need, a place you'd not likely reckon to find folks calling home. Yet if you venture past the derelict Whole Foods and sidle beyond the yearly occupied hotels, their empty rooms waiting for summer kin, you’ll come upon a living, breathing world. Streets unfurl with quiet purpose, and there lie clusters of apartment complexes, each one nestled against the other like Russian dolls dismantled and laid side by side in a deliberate line. The first of these has made the news, whispered tales of ill repute, but such talk is just smoke in the wind. There is more to see, more to know, in the apartments beyond, where life unfolds unbeknownst to the wider world.\n\nAcross from these homes of concrete and glass stands a community college's outpost, a sentinel of learning where students trickle in, clutching coffee and yawns, to greet the morning’s reluctant dawn. The gates groan open in greeting, and students slip through like ghosts, while drivers curse the delay, the inconvenience of it all. The road bends and breaks into another, flanked by a park and a place where broken bones find healing. The rehabilitation center stands with an air of cheer, its porch adorned with furniture and a fan that stirs the heavy summer air in lazy circles.\n\nChildren dance in the park, their limbs flailing in wild abandon, a blur of movement on the green, while bees hover above the flowers, drunk on the sun. Old souls shuffle with their dogs along the path, casting disapproving eyes at the skaters and nodding with soft approval at the young girls who gather to spin tales of boys and fleeting fame. Nearby, a sushi joint offers its wares, its tables never too crowded, while a place to buy swimming supplies and a nail salon sit in patient company. Here, the strip mall promises convenience, a trifecta of pleasure and necessity, where one might indulge in a manicure, a meal, and pool accouterments in one fell swoop. And there’s a frozen yogurt shop too, where teenagers come to cool their tongues and pretend at wisdom, cups of sweetness in hand as they weave across the pavement on their boards, smoke curling from their lips, believing it all to be the height of rebellion. This neighborhood is a tapestry of the American South, where the slow march of time barely registers, and life continues in its unchanging dance.",
            "The neighborhood stands in quiet witness to a bygone era. Houses, mostly singular in their countenance, stand like silent sentinels, though a few have been cleaved into twain yet remain conjoined, if such a thing makes sense. Before my abode, a modest patch of land lies, and to its flank, a narrow drive. These homes, like echoes of another time, speak of dreams once held dear beneath the vast, indifferent sky. The dream of suburbia, an American vision now slipping through grasping fingers, yet still these streets endure, whispering to all who pass that the dream yet breathes, and we cling to its fading promise.\n\nThe folk here, they do not brim with the optimism of yesteryear. The little plots of green are not tended as they once were, but still, there are cars resting in the drives, still the young ones heedless in their play, as if the world beyond were but a distant rumor. The old school, near ninety years standing, still looms, nurturing the young while stirring memory in the aged hearts. Churches stand scattered, more often empty than filled, yet the basketball courts echo with life. The homes, each with its own face, share a soul.\n\nA vast market, Super A, sits under the watchful eye of a Yemeni clan, perhaps the sole Arabs here, amidst a sea of African American neighbors. The streets stretch wide where children play football, only halting when the rumble of cars intrudes. Generations have passed through these streets, each with tales of a time when all knew all. A karate school once thrived here, until the allure waned with the silencing of Hollywood's tales of karate kids. Now it stands as a pharmacy, a place where remedies are promised, or so it is said.\n\nA humble cinema persists, offering old films at a price that draws the elders, nostalgic for simpler nights, while the young seek elsewhere. An expressway cuts near, though its entrance lies just beyond our reach. Once, a petition sought to bring it closer, the youth in favor, the elders wary. In the end, it was the elders' voices that stilled the city council’s hand, fearing it would mar the town's essence. A new high school rises, and with it, the question of a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin might capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawl of this city where I make my home, the neighborhood unfolds like a quilt of manifold hues. The streets weave through a patchwork of residences and commerce, the latter bustling with offices and stores, eateries and places where folk find their mirth. The air is thick with the scent of new restaurants, each vying for the palate, and shops where one might find anything their heart desires. There are the great monoliths of commerce, the brands whose names carry weight, and yet these are flanked by the small boutiques, each with its own whispering allure. They stand in the malls and line the streets, close enough to the quiet enclaves of homes that one might hear the murmur of city life at their threshold.\n\nParks stand as islands amidst the urban sea, where the laughter of children mingles with the rustle of leaves. And the people here, they are as varied as the sky at dawn. Within a stone's throw, you find the vibrant communities of LGBTQ+ folks, the devout Orthodox Jews, and those who have journeyed from the lands of the once mighty Soviet Union. Beyond this small realm, the city stretches further into enclaves of every kind. There is a Korea town, a China town, a Little Armenia, all within a scant few miles, though those miles can stretch into hours when the roads are choked with the gridlock of human endeavor.\n\nFew walk in this city, for the distances are vast and the streets unfriendly to the pedestrian. The traffic is a beast with no master, and parking a prize hard won. Yet the city grows, ever taller and denser, as new apartments rise from the earth. This place draws folk like a beacon, and with them come more cars to clog the arteries of the city. Houses here are a tapestry of forms, from the single-family homes to the duplexes that share their walls. In my own corner of this metropolis, the homes stand varied and diverse, much like the people who dwell within them.\n\nThe faces here are many, the ages varied, though it is a lonesome truth that I know few of those who live beside me. The bonds of community have loosened, though I hold dear the memories of days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter of children echoing in the warmth of the sunlit streets. The city, vast and sprawling, has changed, yet it holds within it the echoes of what once was.",
            "Where is everything, she asked, as we rolled past those endless cornfields that stretched out to meet the sky. This is it, I said, knowing the expanse would lay her soul bare. She came from a place where the grocer's was a mere five-minute walk, and she had never laid eyes on so much unbroken ground. Awash in the vastness, I told her of a life grown in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she saw the shadow of who I was and the soil from which I had sprung. We drove the narrow road, a ribbon of asphalt that wound to a quarry brimming with water, and there beyond lay the little settlement I called home. The houses were brick and stucco, each spread with half an acre of earth that folks tended as their own. Spring would find the land awash in flowers planted new each year, trees in their midwestern dress changing with the seasons. Driveways flaunted their luxury, Mercedes Benzes catching the midday sun like jewels. As we neared my gray stucco abode, my Korean neighbor stood in his yard, ever smiling. He passed his days with the mower, a song rising over its hum. The neighborhood found humor in him, but he was sincere and rich in his tales. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere as if part of the ground itself. At last, you would come to my door. The side yard teemed with geese, ever pursued by the terrier. Behind, a slender stream fed into the quarry, where bullfrogs sang and the far-off low of cattle reached the ear. Across a bridge of hand-hewn wood lay a sanctuary untouched, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers flourished. That was the world of my youth. Building forts in trees and the chase of imagined prey filled our days, always another child for company. Winters here could be cruel in their cold, yet possessed a beauty unmatched. The yard's green turned to a white wilderness. The trees, once flushed with color, stood as bare-boned sentinels. When snow came, the world transformed overnight. Snow angels made by my sister adorned the yard, snowmen too. We were fierce in our play, snowballs the weapons of our quarrels. We built igloos with branches, an armory of our own. In that frozen world, we lived in pretend, two children without a care. The world beyond was naught but a distant echo, and we were free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a small town in Michigan, where the road stretches from vast farmlands to quaint tourist cities. It is a place devoid of sprawling malls or the bright lights of Wal-mart, Target, or even the humble glow of an Applebee’s. Here, the open land demands you drive to your destination, yet it is a place of untouched beauty, wrapped in the embrace of water. My town, if you can call it that, finds itself nestled between the grand expanse of Lake Michigan and the serene waters of Lake Charlevoix. Shores stretch out, inviting the weary to rest their feet in the cool embrace of the sand and surf.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks in the quiet tongue of small-town life. Houses stand apart, not the uniformity of modernity but relics of a bygone era, some tended to with care, others left to the ravages of time. Full basements peer from beneath the ground along the streets, and aluminum siding glints under the sun. The spectrum of home colors paints the blocks in a myriad of hues, each with a yard where children’s laughter echoes from trampolines and playsets. Gardens grow in the care of those who tend to them, fences keep the animals safe. It is the visage of Middle America, where laboring hands strive to carve out a living, nurturing the young or reflecting on the past.\n\nIn this place, the streets are alive with the patter of children’s feet, the bark of a dog, the hum of bicycles and rollerblades. Neighbors nod in recognition, a silent understanding of who belongs. A grill sends up smoke as a friendly wave passes between strangers, a smile exchanged from afar. Lawns are kept neat, leaves banished, the grass a verdant carpet beneath the feet. It may not be a neighborhood that inspires awe, but it is a sanctuary, a haven for families to grow and find their peace. The quiet speaks volumes; it is a place of safety, a refuge at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, the health department its neighbor, and the recycling center serves the community’s needs. The crack of bat against ball echoes from fields where children play, their names called out by unseen voices. And the small town airport, where the roar of engines shatters the silence, planes climbing into the open sky. Ice cream waits within walking distance, a sweet reward for those who venture downtown. Eight blocks away, the park welcomes my children’s bikes. It is a place of simple joys and unassuming grace, a good place to call home.",
            "In the land where the houses stand in neat rows like sentinels of some forgotten order, there lies the neighborhood that wears the face of the commonplace. A suburbia wrought by the hand of uniformity, sculpted under the stern eye of the homeowner's association. Upon entry, you are greeted by the unyielding symmetry of manicured lawns and homes that whisper the same secrets, each with a patch of green, some stones scattered like the memories of lost landscapes, and driveways that stretch briefly from street to home. The trees, sparse and deliberate, stand as if planted by some ancient decree. Each domicile boasts a garage for two, a testament to the lives within.\n\nAs you traverse this place, the roads, smooth as a river's stone, bear no blemish nor scar. The asphalt, unmarked by time's passage, speaks of a relentless upkeep that defies the entropy of the world beyond. The houses, mostly of a single story, rise occasionally to two, breaking the horizon like the quiet rise of a thought unspoken. Mailboxes do not stand solitary at the curb but gather at the street's end in a cluster, a congregation of metal that demands a key for entry, parcels held in lockers as if secrets kept by the community itself.\n\nThe boundary of this neighborhood lies at the edge of the city's reach, a place where the rural and the suburban converge, giving rise to expanses of land that invite the wanderer to walk its paths. Pools, gated and pristine, lie in wait for those who seek solace in their waters. Trails wind through the community, offering the promise of solitude or the company of a faithful hound at one's side. Here, exercise needs no park, for the neighborhood is vast enough to hold your running feet.\n\nThe souls who dwell here are mostly those who have seen the seasons turn many times, retirees who watch over one another with a quiet vigilance. Yet, among them, the young professionals and the middle-aged find their place, adding their stories to the tapestry of life here. The city nearby, a paradox of size and intimacy, offers its bounty of amenities. A single mall stands as the heart of commerce, modest in size but sufficient to the needs of those who seek its wares. Fifteen minutes by car will take you to any place of note, where high-end grocers share space with outlets of frugality, each with their own tale to tell.\n\nAnd so this place, safe and tended with care, holds within it the trappings of a familiar life. The pools and trails, the order and the quiet, all speak of a world crafted for comfort. Though the shopping lies a journey away, it is but a small price for the peace this land bestows.",
            "The first I’d heard of the place was listening to some broadcast about lost souls. It caught me off guard, unexpected like. Every flat around here runs up past a thousand a month and nobody ever spoke of such tales, not to me or any of the folks I knew. Maybe it’s the struggle. I know some who cry themselves to sleep, though they won’t say it. The cost of things bears down hard but we’ve learned to scrape by. You come to embrace the scent of old toys and clothes kept from the moths. You find yourself smelling less as the years weigh in. Maybe you take up smoking or maybe you just grow used to the way of things. But the flea market stands its ground. The odor of grown days is dusty stacks of magazines on a silent piano. It settles in the leather and stays there even after washing. Around here, three thrift stores lie within strolling distance. Start on the far side and you’ll see two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book shop, and a curio store. Downtown’s tight with cars and bodies, filling the streets at dawn, but you’d never hear them in the thrifts. No matter the passing crowd or traffic, the place holds its hush. It’s a fine spot to let the afternoon slip away. Each year brings more of those. Cars and people flood the city. They say it’s growing, a city in the throes of change. Headquartering a vast online empire for commerce and delivery, still showing the ache of growth. It calls to mind New York. Every soul bent on their own path, not much asked of you. Alone you can be, quiet, independent, and the world leaves you be. Not like the South, where concern shows you care. Here, no life is pried into. You keep your shell as long as you need, and the city rolls back like the tide. Lively place. With a pianist next door and two singers upstairs, there’s always something stirring. In some sense, it’s less a flat of strangers and more a kinship of friends. We gather for needs, mark birthdays, mourn farewells, lend a hand where we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Neighbors mostly good folk, and they treat me right. I clean up, leave them food, and they do the same. Carry mail back and forth. Nice to see them, and I think they find my company pleasing as well. I dwell in this vast, cold modern sprawl yet it’s folks like my neighbors that make me think I ain’t gone and wrecked my life.",
            "In the heartland where the land sprawls out like an old quilt, patched and mended, there lies a town caught on the edge of the city’s reach, where the concrete gives way to fields and the promise of quiet. I make my home on the eastern side of this town, a place where the dollar stretches thin and the roofs sit low under the weight of time. The houses, humble in their wearing, stand as if in quiet defiance, occupied by those who find their footing on the margins. Yet the streets are not without their grace, and the folks here, they nod and tip their hats, a silent kinship exchanged among strangers.\n\nThe specter of crime lingers at the edges, a whispered tale of the past decade: a scattering of violence, the crack of a gunshot in the night, the grief of a mother next door whose boy fell to the dark outside a bar. We’ve been spared, mostly, save for a trinket or two vanished from the porch when the dusk cloaks the world. The town bears the scars of a greater curse, an epidemic of powdered despair that steals breath and life, fentanyl its name, carving holes in families and futures. Yet here, against the tide, rise centers of hope, places of healing, where Narcan finds its way into hands ready to save.\n\nAmidst the trials, the town stands resilient, its virtues steadfast. My son finds sanctuary in the schoolhouse, where the walls echo with laughter and learning, untouched by cruelty despite the challenges he bears. The teachers, the principal, they form a bastion of goodwill and care, ushering each child with a gentle hand. The PTO breathes life into the halls, crafting moments of joy and togetherness. Poverty casts its shadow, yet no child feels its chill; meals are given freely, dignity preserved.\n\nThe council speaks of progress, their hands busy with the town’s face-lift, though their gaze seldom shifts eastward. Here on our side, the roads remain cracked, the parks overgrown, promises whispered but not kept, a thorn in the side of those who call this place home. Yet in spite of it all, I find solace here. The people, they are kind; the shops, sufficient; the life, enough. Our home, its worth measured not in gold but in comfort, stands as testament to sixteen years of roots sunk deep into this soil. And here, in this town, we remain, unable to picture a life beyond its borders.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like some ancient thing, its bones wrapped in a shroud of history, buildings stacked with tales long told. I make my home in a seven-story edifice that stands sentinel across from the old theater where echoes linger. Down the slope, a block away, there's a small arcade bar where souls gather, drawn into its warmth like moths to a flame on summer's breath. On those nights, lines snake along the pavement, a testament to the life that pulses here.\n\nA few blocks further, the city park unfolds itself, a vast expanse of green framed by stone and concrete, steps hewn into its sides like scars. In the cold grip of winter, the homeless set their tents in rows, a testament to the struggle against the chill and the rain that falls relentless from a brooding sky. They huddle close, seeking warmth and solace in the heart of the city, not out in the wilderness where the jungle waits. The family center, a beacon of respite, lies within reach, offering the gift of warmth and water.\n\nYet it is not the storied architecture or the whispers of history that bind me to this place. It is the people, the culture that throbs within. Hilltop, once a name feared, a place of violence and dark tales, still breathes its stories. The streets remember the sweep of authority, the cleansing that left only memories behind. The people hold onto these tales, passing them down like heirlooms, marking the passage of time and change.\n\nThey labor still to cleanse their streets, to nurture their home. They speak of caution, of danger after dark, warnings flavored by the past, by the fears that linger. Perhaps my skin, shaded just enough, finds acceptance here, or perhaps they see in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history's burden, the shadows cast by ignorance and fear. This city, a supposed haven of diversity, still struggles with the ghosts of division.\n\nYet the Hilltop is my anchor, my home. In its embrace, I walk the night, alive and unafraid. Here, kindness finds me more often than malice. Strangers offer warmth where coldness might dwell. Laundromats remain open, their lights a refuge against the storm. And on the bleakest of nights, I find myself seen, valued by the tender act of a stranger’s hand.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when words fell flat against the hardness of new faces. Friends were hard to find. I found them nonetheless, a boy two doors down and another further along the street. They've long since moved, but the echoes of our days never left. Most folks who were here when I arrived remain as if time has held them in its quiet embrace. The place is like any other stretch of suburban America, two-story houses standing watch over their little plots of earth. Come the weekend or any warm day, the air fills with the laughter of children, yet the quiet holds its dominion through the week. There's a peace here, an understanding that a man is left to his own unless he seeks aid. Packages arrive on the doorstep and stay unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds the neighbors.\n\nA park lies a minute's walk from my door, a small green world of memory. There, I played basketball and football, the crack of the bat echoing in the evenings. It was there, too, that I took an elbow to the nose, a painful reminder that not all memories are sweet, yet the good far outweigh the bad. Now, when I wander that way, it is with my cousin's young ones, their eyes bright with the thrill of swings and slides. That park stirs something deep, a well of nostalgia that flows unbidden.\n\nThe neighborhood, a tapestry of faces and flavors. Within a mile, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare mingle in the air. Yet the world shifts, and convenience rules the day. GrubHub and DoorDash ferry meals to doorsteps, though the golden arches still beckon as they do in every suburb. Pizza abounds, a staple of American life. The stores, they offer all one might need. Dry cleaners dot the area, and there's a Walgreens and a CVS standing sentinel on the same street. Jewel-Osco, a beacon of the Midwest, serves the community's needs. Even diversity finds its place, an Indian-owned store offering spices and meals to those who seek them.\n\nIn all, I hold my neighborhood dear. The tales of neighborly strife that ripple across the digital world make me thankful for the peace that surrounds me. Here, in this quiet solace, I find contentment.",
            "The place where I live rests close by to the college I attend, and for this reason I find some contentment in dwelling there. The neighborhood is a patchwork of apartment buildings, with a scattering of eateries and bars that offer diversion without draining the purse too severely. One bar has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though its offerings and service aren't the worst one might find. The populace is generally of a decent sort. You'll find college youth mingling with those of humbler means, drawn by the affordability of the housing. Children abound, owing to the elementary school within a stone's throw from my abode. The neighbors remain strangers to me, and I prefer it so. They indulge in the smoking of weed, prompting the management to install an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing to the point of insult. The buildings around me bear the marks of age, though some may conceal renovated hearts. Further down the way stand newly minted apartments, but I hold them in low regard, knowing the shoddy craftsmanship that raised them. They charge dear for rent, a swindle made permissible by their proximity to the campus. There's a nearby eatery, cheap and cheerful, serving its fare on paper plates and warming meals by microwave. Across from it lies a gas station, reputedly a poor place of employment. Yet last summer saw the city bestow funds to refurbish the road, laying down a broad sidewalk with green medians, lending the area a touch of grace. My apartment is cloaked in trees, though a few have been felled, leaving stumps like gravestones. More trees shade my street than the road beyond. Behind my complex lies a tree line, then another spread of apartments. I reside on 42nd street; 43rd looms behind, less comely with sidewalks crumbling and buildings in disrepair. Trees line this street as if to hide its blemishes. Crime finds a home in a nearby complex and across the way, where residents come and go like whispers on the wind. Yet I find some fondness for where I dwell. It's within my means, and the conveniences it offers are ample. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops grant swift passage to the store and downtown.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled across the cul-de-sac like a tale half-told, duplexes scattered with the care of a child's hand arranging a toy village. Each building stood painted in a uniform yellow, with white porches and green roofs of metal that gleamed in the sun, giving them an appearance of singular homes though they were not. In this cluster of sameness, a kinship had formed among most, though not all, neighbors. As the day waned, we gathered, unbidden, at the end of a driveway to exchange words that floated on the warm air while children played out their own worlds with chalk and kites beneath a sky vast and blue, the clouds drifting like old ships in calm seas. It was here, in this place, that the noise of the modern world receded, a step back into a time less hurried.\n\nBeyond us lay fields and trees, their green depths touched by the sky's endless blue. But with the season came the threat of storms, and the night before had brought the wail of tornado sirens, the first I'd ever heard. We sought shelter, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and a purse filled with the little comforts of life, as the larger one barked his fear to the quiet room from the living room. The storm passed, leaving the ground littered with hail that sang its cold song as it melted away. The air, suddenly cool, steamed from the heat it had known moments before. In the aftermath, as the sun broke through and rain fell from a clearing sky, a double rainbow arced above, a promise painted in light. I seized my camera, captured the scene, and shared it with those who would marvel at such wonders, as did I. The street lay silent still, until life resumed its steady pace, mothers and children emerging as the evening meal cooked inside.\n\nI had come here, a stranger from the north, to find a community that spoke in a tongue soft with the southern drawl, a two-bedroom apartment like the others yet distinct within. Some were small, defying reason, but mine was a good fit. Behind stretched a vast field, and beyond that a pond where deer wandered and bullfrogs sang in the dawn. It was a place that felt remote, yet lay but forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Roosters heralded the mornings, their calls mingling with the bray of a distant donkey, a reminder of the farms that circled us like sentinels of a bygone era. Here, in this corner of the world, I had found a place to call home.",
            "I reckon it's been near a decade I've walked these streets and breathed the air that fills this place. A soul can't help but gather tales to tell. When I first set foot in this neighborhood, sorrow was my shadow. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore me up inside. I cried for the days left behind, the faces I loved. My folks, they sought a better life for me and my sister. So we moved, chasing better houses and finer schools, places folks called not ghetto. As time unspooled, I grew accustomed to the new horizon. Made friends, made enemies too, in the halls of that school. The neighbors, they stayed distant save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis, who lived right nearby. They became family in ways unspoken, and I hold them dear. I recall the day when me and my kin went to Mr. Glen’s wedding—his re-marrying. Joyful it was, a harbinger of dreams I keep for myself, to one day shower my own bride with the life of royalty. When Ms. Veda tossed that white garter, it was my hand that caught it. But the flowers eluded me. We danced till the stars blinked out, and I remember the laughter shared with Marsharii, but she's a ghost now, gone on her way. The neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, but with a GPS in hand, I wander its paths. I've ventured far only with Kason and Curtis, comrades in games and in life. We reveled in the simple things, the fleeting joys of youth. At times, I'd find solace in the park, nature's balm on a restless spirit. With sticks from the Home Depot, I'd practice balance, wield my bokken wooden sword. It's a joy that remains untouched by time. There's a court for basketball and tennis too, though it's been a spell since I laid hand to racket or ball. My dad, he nurtured a love for tennis in me and my friend alongside Mr. Graves, who pushed us hard, but we laughed all the way through. This place holds a tapestry of memories, and while many stories dwell here, these are the ones that linger, whispering of the promise the future holds untold.",
            "The town lies quiet beneath the Carolina sun, a modest settlement not marked by grandeur but by the silent labor of its fields. Johnston, they call it, the Peach Capital of the World, and the sign at the edge of it declares this proudly to any who might pass by. Farmland stretches out from the heart of the town, where peach trees stand in orderly rows and cattle dot the landscape like slow-moving shadows. Homes scatter themselves across this expanse, solitary and spaced, two-story structures with roofs of metal or gray shingle to beat back the heat of a relentless summer. They sit back from the road, yielding the front lands to the hands of farmers and the tread of beasts.\n\nIn the town’s small core, a single stoplight dangles above the crossroads, marking the place where commerce takes what little root it can. There are but a few places to find a meal prepared for you—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese kitchen, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger joint. A pizzeria once graced this town, but it shuttered its doors in the recent past. Maxwell and Halford Drug stands, a tiny pharmacy with a reputation more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its remedies. The Independent Grocers Alliance, known simply as IGA, is the lone grocery store, but many make the journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General is the lifeblood of the town’s commerce, its aisles crowded from dawn to dusk with those seeking the essentials of life.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More sits under the stewardship of a kind-hearted woman, her store a fixture of the community with two men employed to deliver the wares. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town’s pets with care, offering grooming and shelter in equal measure. A doctor’s office and a veterinary practice both lie beyond the town’s center, small yet sufficient to the needs of the people. Johnston Elementary School is where the young learn their letters and numbers until such time they must travel to the next town for further schooling.\n\nNo parks grace this place, though plans are afoot to carve out a space for families, a 2.5-acre hope for the future. The town lacks theaters and alleys of bowling, lacks places for children to play or for folks to gather. Yet there is a quiet charm to it, a simplicity that might be missed if you blink as you pass through, but for those who stop long enough to see, Johnston is a place where the world slows and one can breathe.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I dwell in a modest suburb. A street that stretches between two state highways, it draws more traffic than one might hope for, yet the neighborhood holds its quietude like a secret. The folks here, they don’t come and go much. I've come to know the rhythm of their lives, the hum of their daily labors, the yardwork that keeps them occupied. Winter finds us sledding down the hill on our side street, a brief, cold reprieve from the sameness of days. Our house sits at the corner, a sentinel that watches over all who pass by. Familiarity breeds with each car that rolls by, though a stranger's vehicle is noted with a certain curiosity. \n\nSome neighbors take to walking, a habit of health or necessity, dogs in tow. Children weave through the quiet on their bicycles. We, too, are at home more often than not, the nature of our work binding us to this place. My wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, have woven ourselves into the fabric of this street’s daily life. We venture out for play, unbothered by rain. The grill on the back deck sends up smoke and scent, a signal of small happiness. And there is the ever-present sound of lawn mowers from spring till the grass ceases its growth in October. Trees abound, remnants of an older forest, granting shade in summer and a cascade of leaves in fall, demanding the annual ritual of rake and burn. The scent of burning leaves, it’s the harbinger of autumn’s arrival.\n\nWinter has been scarce of late, stretching the fall into a long, unbroken pause. Our garage faces the back, so the front door sees little use unless a visitor calls, a rarity. I occupy myself with tasks in the garage, the truck and other projects, and with doors open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays pass quietly, Thanksgiving bringing a scattering of distant kin and their vehicles, a similar scene on Mother’s Day and Christmas. This place, I find a fondness for it. Were it not for the cars that hurry through, it might be nigh unto perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert sits a neighborhood of dust and earth, where the land stretches barren and brown under a relentless sun. Those who have not walked its parched ground cannot fathom the oppression of such a monochrome world, save for the rare oasis of green where a man has surrendered riches to coax life from the soil. When I first came here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide, a testament to solitude. Even now, with the new structures rising, the essence remains. The sprawl speaks of a city, yet it mirrors the change found in all places. People here bear warmth in their hearts, though shadows linger as in any town. My own corner of this desert is surrounded by kindly elders, marking it a refuge of sorts. The commerce of this place is dominated by familiar names, chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For the finer things, one must journey afar, for Whole Foods and their ilk are strangers here. Construction reigns in the trade of men, for this city is a canvas yet to be filled, its expanses inviting the hand of progress. This prospect unsettles me, for I cherish the present state, having fled the clamor of a metropolis and unwilling to return. I labor in this field, a craftsman of drywall and T-bar, marking my days with the rhythm of creation.\n\nYet the land holds its own allure, a sanctuary for creatures adapted to its harsh embrace. The desert's stark beauty draws souls seeking its truth, its challenging ecosystems demanding respect for coexistence. We, too, have found our place among the wild things, my children captivated by lizards and the myriad insects of the sands. Even as I write, their laughter echoes outside as they pursue their quarry. Our town offers its diversions, a taste of adventure in the embrace of Victorville. It is a haven for families, the desert unfolding its mysteries. Plan to visit when the San Bernardino County Fair enlivens the air, offering a Victorville welcome. Venture to nearby Wrightwood, where snow-capped peaks promise lessons in winter's arts. For those drawn to the origins of this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands with its relics of geology and ancient peoples, chronicling the tale of Victorville's rise from the dust.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, I reckon my answer might strike as peculiar. Where others might speak of picket fences and lawns, I speak of a place more transient and yet, for a time, eternal. The college campus where I bide my days, it is the land I call home, and the souls within the dormitory walls, they are my kin. Beyond them lies the campus, which sprawls like a yard untamed, a neighborhood in its own right, though lesser and more diffuse.\n\nYet here lies the truth of it: my neighborhood, though strange, is not so unlike those places people call home. It has its own houses, its own people, its own shops and parks. Let me take you through the houses that stand in this peculiar quarter. Three sorts there are—apartments, true houses, and those dormitory halls. In the apartments, they stack folk two or four to a chamber, with four to six chambers a floor. Two stories they rise, and twenty souls they hold, give or take.\n\nThen there are the houses, proper homes for those bound to the school, mostly alumni, who dwell within their two to four room confines. But scarce are these, scattered few across the land, for they are not efficient. Last, there are the dormitories—long corridors lined with rooms where hundreds of students abide. In each, two share a space, for the most part, and these dorms are the heart of my neighborhood.\n\nNow with the houses spoken for, let us turn to the people. The school takes pride in its diversity, and it is here, in the faces you meet in the halls and on the paths. From all lands and ages they come, making this place a tapestry of the world. The staff, they find shelter in the scattered houses, while new students fill the dorms and the older ones take to the apartments.\n\nAs for the stores and the parks, these too are part of my world. The campus is a town unto itself, with a bounty of shops and one lone park. There are places to eat, as there are in any town, and stores with the school’s own wares. In this neighborhood, whatever you seek is within reach. The park, a small respite, is a haven where all gather, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who dwell here.",
            "In the place where I reside, sidewalks are few and far between. The land falls away, giving itself to gravity, and my dwelling stands at the pinnacle of the steepest incline that the local folk know as the \"work out hill,\" for it beckons those who seek to test their mettle upon its slope. No sidewalks grace our street, so the people walk upon the asphalt, where the road is rough-hewn and treacherous to traverse. The wires of telephone and electric strung overhead hang in tatters, battered by the gales and storms that sweep through our land, leaving branches and debris to fell them time and again, their repair a patchwork quilt of human endeavor. Towering evergreens cast their long shadows all around, yet they are not cherished. No, the folk here wield their axes against them, for they covet the view of the sea, unbroken and vast. Thus, the houses rise high upon the hillside, glass-fronted and lofty, seeking the bay's embrace. At day's end, the sun kindles the water, and the heavens burn with orange, though oftentimes the clouds conspire to shroud that celestial fire. The days are gray and wet, and moss clings to all it can, to roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, I left my automobile idle in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it wore a green and furry coat of moss that took three hours to scrape clean. Here, children are scarce, though a school lies but a few blocks distant. My neighbors are mostly of the older sort, many having surrendered to retirement. In place of children, they keep dogs. You’ll see them lounging on lawns or racing down the street, and woe to those who leave a door or window ajar, for the dogs will venture in unbidden. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it back out. Rabbits run rampant, too, some well-sized, much to the chagrin of the gardeners, who curse their burrows and their plundering of roots. My cats, they delight in the chase and have driven most rabbits from our midst. Birds are plentiful, flitting sparrows and hummingbirds, and now and then a hawk or eagle will appear, only to be chased away by the crows that rule the sky. Shops do not dwell here, but down the hill at the water’s edge, a few eateries serve the bounty of the sea. The beach is scant, but the rocks along the shore are fit for casting into the depths, and the bay is narrow; you can glimpse the far shore even through the mist that clings like a shroud most days.",
            "If you find yourself bound for Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, know that you will not struggle to find your way. The city’s arteries of steel and rail run deep and wide, carrying the masses to and fro with the ceaseless clamor of New York’s own breath. Bensonhurst stands proudly urban, its streets echoing the same rhythms that pulse through the heart of the city itself. And as you wander those streets, your eyes will fall upon the myriad Asian shops that have taken root. In the passing of two decades, the neighborhood has welcomed an influx of Asian souls, their presence marked by the scent of spice and the hum of commerce. Every block tells the tale, a testament to the supermarkets and laundromats that dot the landscape, serving the people with the nourishment they seek and the cleanliness they crave. The food is good, the prices fair, and the convenience unrivaled. Just beyond where I stand, four Asian markets lie clustered within two minutes' walk of each other, each a beacon of sustenance.\n\nYet do not let it be said that Bensonhurst is solely a haven for the Asian community. It is a mosaic, diverse and sprawling, with immigrants and their children, first and second generation, weaving the rich tapestry of life here. The businesses, large and small, speak of Asian ownership, yet they coexist alongside a recently renewed park, a refuge of play and sport. There, the earth is marked with ten basketball courts, a broad field for soccer or baseball, and courts for handball, swings, and a playground for the young ones. Even a fountain stands to bring joy in the heat of summer. The park is a testament to the city’s diversity, where all manner of folk gather and find common ground.\n\nThe skyline here is not pierced by the monoliths of corporate ambition, but rather by dwellings of cooperative living and condominium stature. Predominantly, it is a place of two-family homes, where life unfolds with a certain clatter. The people are kind, though their voices are loud. The air is filled with the roar of engines and the thrum of music as cars pass by, relentless and waking the dawn. Should your visit find you beneath the night’s cloak, be wary. The neighborhood, though safe, is unpredictable as the city’s own soul. Trouble may arise unbidden, in the form of bullies or thieves. I have felt it myself in years past, the sting of assault, and more recently, the theft of parcels. Such is the way of things. And though the city demands cleanliness, the rule is oft ignored. The morning light reveals the neglect, the dog waste that mars the path to the train or the market. It is a vexation, an affront to the senses, and one must tread carefully to keep their shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, a town known to some as a bastion of oddity, there lies a truth about the very notion of \"weird.\" Scrawled upon the brick of a building that harbors a pizza joint, bar, music hall, and strip club, a phrase boldly declares, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To the few who remember, it calls back to the Portland of another time, a place less exposed to the world, where creativity roamed untethered in the shadows of the 90s and early 2000s. To others, it is a siren’s song, a lure to a city where the label of weird is worn like a medal of honor. Despite the tide of Californians with their gilded pockets and the rise of glass towers to shelter them, Portland remains untamed. Weirdness here does not always mean open arms, but rather an embrace of the unorthodox. It does not shun modernity, nor its struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we trade with the far East, our goods shipped from China’s distant shores. There are countless ways to be strange, to deviate from the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. It has yoga studios, hipsters, and men in suits. Perhaps being weird is simply to gaze upon all this with a wry smile. In my part of town, as in many corners of Portland, houses stand adorned in hues of the rainbow, gardens spill their bounty onto the sidewalk, and free boxes appear with the sun. These boxes, often simple cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold within them the magic of serendipity, offering treasures to the passerby. They brim with clothes, books, and sometimes the unexpected. This simple wonder of wandering the streets of Southeast Portland is the essence of the city, at least to me, though I am but one peculiar soul among many. Among us are those who would never dream of fetching garments from a box left on the curb. These folks linger at goat yoga—yes, the mats shared with bleating companions—or cheer at Timbers matches. Portland is a mosaic of passions, of dreams pursued or merely contemplated over drinks in dimly lit bars. It harbors a malaise of substances, a shadow cast by the mind’s turmoil, perhaps nurtured by the unending rain and the oppressive gray of the sky. Homelessness is another specter that haunts the city, a dilemma unsolved, despite the services that outshine much of the nation. The housed oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not so peculiar after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, ever present in the north, bearing silent witness to the sun's pilgrimage at dawn and dusk. No matter the forgetfulness of men or the ceaseless pace of their lives, they remain steadfast, untouched by the brief tribulations that consume us. And on those days when the weight of the world bears down and the soul strains under its yoke, the mountains call out with a quiet insistence. They compel the eyes to look upon them, and in that gaze, there comes a balm for the anxious spirit, a quiet fortitude to endure another day. I came to this land as a young scholar, my heart and mind drawn to the mountains that stood sentinel to the north of the campus. The university, with its grand buildings and serene ponds, has its own allure, but it is the mountains that hold dominion over my heart. The town itself carries a humble beauty. Countless cafés have played host to hours of study beneath the caffeinated haze. One can wander or take the bus to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper tales of old. Here, this suburban place hums with the vigor of its urban neighbor, though the thrumming energy fades as you pass the library and find yourself once more in the quiet embrace of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city a mysterious charm, beckoning the curious to explore its depths. Thus, it is easy to craft memories, each tied to a corner of the town. Be it the rusted swings in the park swaying in the night wind or the race through the bustling streets to catch a film at the grand theater. Yet, as with all places, it holds its share of harsh memories. The ponds, reflections of the soul, serve as sanctuaries for solitude or tears shed in the hours when time seems to stand still. Here, in the company of turtles and ducks and insects, all fulfilling their purpose, I ponder my own role in this vast enigma called life. I walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that breathe suburbia, until the street unfurls before me. The sun casts its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky with its brilliance, and I realize my footsteps take me northward. And there, as always, are the mountains. Majestic and unwavering, they brush against the sky, a testament to endurance that speaks to the heart without uttering a word.",
            "It might escape your notice at first, the way things do when they are not meant to be seen or when they hide in plain sight. A residential sprawl tucked behind the commerce of consumption and need, a place you'd not likely reckon to find folks calling home. Yet if you venture past the derelict Whole Foods and sidle beyond the yearly occupied hotels, their empty rooms waiting for summer kin, you’ll come upon a living, breathing world. Streets unfurl with quiet purpose, and there lie clusters of apartment complexes, each one nestled against the other like Russian dolls dismantled and laid side by side in a deliberate line. The first of these has made the news, whispered tales of ill repute, but such talk is just smoke in the wind. There is more to see, more to know, in the apartments beyond, where life unfolds unbeknownst to the wider world.\n\nAcross from these homes of concrete and glass stands a community college's outpost, a sentinel of learning where students trickle in, clutching coffee and yawns, to greet the morning’s reluctant dawn. The gates groan open in greeting, and students slip through like ghosts, while drivers curse the delay, the inconvenience of it all. The road bends and breaks into another, flanked by a park and a place where broken bones find healing. The rehabilitation center stands with an air of cheer, its porch adorned with furniture and a fan that stirs the heavy summer air in lazy circles.\n\nChildren dance in the park, their limbs flailing in wild abandon, a blur of movement on the green, while bees hover above the flowers, drunk on the sun. Old souls shuffle with their dogs along the path, casting disapproving eyes at the skaters and nodding with soft approval at the young girls who gather to spin tales of boys and fleeting fame. Nearby, a sushi joint offers its wares, its tables never too crowded, while a place to buy swimming supplies and a nail salon sit in patient company. Here, the strip mall promises convenience, a trifecta of pleasure and necessity, where one might indulge in a manicure, a meal, and pool accouterments in one fell swoop. And there’s a frozen yogurt shop too, where teenagers come to cool their tongues and pretend at wisdom, cups of sweetness in hand as they weave across the pavement on their boards, smoke curling from their lips, believing it all to be the height of rebellion. This neighborhood is a tapestry of the American South, where the slow march of time barely registers, and life continues in its unchanging dance.",
            "The neighborhood stands in quiet witness to a bygone era. Houses, mostly singular in their countenance, stand like silent sentinels, though a few have been cleaved into twain yet remain conjoined, if such a thing makes sense. Before my abode, a modest patch of land lies, and to its flank, a narrow drive. These homes, like echoes of another time, speak of dreams once held dear beneath the vast, indifferent sky. The dream of suburbia, an American vision now slipping through grasping fingers, yet still these streets endure, whispering to all who pass that the dream yet breathes, and we cling to its fading promise.\n\nThe folk here, they do not brim with the optimism of yesteryear. The little plots of green are not tended as they once were, but still, there are cars resting in the drives, still the young ones heedless in their play, as if the world beyond were but a distant rumor. The old school, near ninety years standing, still looms, nurturing the young while stirring memory in the aged hearts. Churches stand scattered, more often empty than filled, yet the basketball courts echo with life. The homes, each with its own face, share a soul.\n\nA vast market, Super A, sits under the watchful eye of a Yemeni clan, perhaps the sole Arabs here, amidst a sea of African American neighbors. The streets stretch wide where children play football, only halting when the rumble of cars intrudes. Generations have passed through these streets, each with tales of a time when all knew all. A karate school once thrived here, until the allure waned with the silencing of Hollywood's tales of karate kids. Now it stands as a pharmacy, a place where remedies are promised, or so it is said.\n\nA humble cinema persists, offering old films at a price that draws the elders, nostalgic for simpler nights, while the young seek elsewhere. An expressway cuts near, though its entrance lies just beyond our reach. Once, a petition sought to bring it closer, the youth in favor, the elders wary. In the end, it was the elders' voices that stilled the city council’s hand, fearing it would mar the town's essence. A new high school rises, and with it, the question of a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin might capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawl of this city where I make my home, the neighborhood unfolds like a quilt of manifold hues. The streets weave through a patchwork of residences and commerce, the latter bustling with offices and stores, eateries and places where folk find their mirth. The air is thick with the scent of new restaurants, each vying for the palate, and shops where one might find anything their heart desires. There are the great monoliths of commerce, the brands whose names carry weight, and yet these are flanked by the small boutiques, each with its own whispering allure. They stand in the malls and line the streets, close enough to the quiet enclaves of homes that one might hear the murmur of city life at their threshold.\n\nParks stand as islands amidst the urban sea, where the laughter of children mingles with the rustle of leaves. And the people here, they are as varied as the sky at dawn. Within a stone's throw, you find the vibrant communities of LGBTQ+ folks, the devout Orthodox Jews, and those who have journeyed from the lands of the once mighty Soviet Union. Beyond this small realm, the city stretches further into enclaves of every kind. There is a Korea town, a China town, a Little Armenia, all within a scant few miles, though those miles can stretch into hours when the roads are choked with the gridlock of human endeavor.\n\nFew walk in this city, for the distances are vast and the streets unfriendly to the pedestrian. The traffic is a beast with no master, and parking a prize hard won. Yet the city grows, ever taller and denser, as new apartments rise from the earth. This place draws folk like a beacon, and with them come more cars to clog the arteries of the city. Houses here are a tapestry of forms, from the single-family homes to the duplexes that share their walls. In my own corner of this metropolis, the homes stand varied and diverse, much like the people who dwell within them.\n\nThe faces here are many, the ages varied, though it is a lonesome truth that I know few of those who live beside me. The bonds of community have loosened, though I hold dear the memories of days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter of children echoing in the warmth of the sunlit streets. The city, vast and sprawling, has changed, yet it holds within it the echoes of what once was.",
            "Where is everything, she asked, as we rolled past those endless cornfields that stretched out to meet the sky. This is it, I said, knowing the expanse would lay her soul bare. She came from a place where the grocer's was a mere five-minute walk, and she had never laid eyes on so much unbroken ground. Awash in the vastness, I told her of a life grown in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she saw the shadow of who I was and the soil from which I had sprung. We drove the narrow road, a ribbon of asphalt that wound to a quarry brimming with water, and there beyond lay the little settlement I called home. The houses were brick and stucco, each spread with half an acre of earth that folks tended as their own. Spring would find the land awash in flowers planted new each year, trees in their midwestern dress changing with the seasons. Driveways flaunted their luxury, Mercedes Benzes catching the midday sun like jewels. As we neared my gray stucco abode, my Korean neighbor stood in his yard, ever smiling. He passed his days with the mower, a song rising over its hum. The neighborhood found humor in him, but he was sincere and rich in his tales. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere as if part of the ground itself. At last, you would come to my door. The side yard teemed with geese, ever pursued by the terrier. Behind, a slender stream fed into the quarry, where bullfrogs sang and the far-off low of cattle reached the ear. Across a bridge of hand-hewn wood lay a sanctuary untouched, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers flourished. That was the world of my youth. Building forts in trees and the chase of imagined prey filled our days, always another child for company. Winters here could be cruel in their cold, yet possessed a beauty unmatched. The yard's green turned to a white wilderness. The trees, once flushed with color, stood as bare-boned sentinels. When snow came, the world transformed overnight. Snow angels made by my sister adorned the yard, snowmen too. We were fierce in our play, snowballs the weapons of our quarrels. We built igloos with branches, an armory of our own. In that frozen world, we lived in pretend, two children without a care. The world beyond was naught but a distant echo, and we were free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a small town in Michigan, where the road stretches from vast farmlands to quaint tourist cities. It is a place devoid of sprawling malls or the bright lights of Wal-mart, Target, or even the humble glow of an Applebee’s. Here, the open land demands you drive to your destination, yet it is a place of untouched beauty, wrapped in the embrace of water. My town, if you can call it that, finds itself nestled between the grand expanse of Lake Michigan and the serene waters of Lake Charlevoix. Shores stretch out, inviting the weary to rest their feet in the cool embrace of the sand and surf.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks in the quiet tongue of small-town life. Houses stand apart, not the uniformity of modernity but relics of a bygone era, some tended to with care, others left to the ravages of time. Full basements peer from beneath the ground along the streets, and aluminum siding glints under the sun. The spectrum of home colors paints the blocks in a myriad of hues, each with a yard where children’s laughter echoes from trampolines and playsets. Gardens grow in the care of those who tend to them, fences keep the animals safe. It is the visage of Middle America, where laboring hands strive to carve out a living, nurturing the young or reflecting on the past.\n\nIn this place, the streets are alive with the patter of children’s feet, the bark of a dog, the hum of bicycles and rollerblades. Neighbors nod in recognition, a silent understanding of who belongs. A grill sends up smoke as a friendly wave passes between strangers, a smile exchanged from afar. Lawns are kept neat, leaves banished, the grass a verdant carpet beneath the feet. It may not be a neighborhood that inspires awe, but it is a sanctuary, a haven for families to grow and find their peace. The quiet speaks volumes; it is a place of safety, a refuge at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, the health department its neighbor, and the recycling center serves the community’s needs. The crack of bat against ball echoes from fields where children play, their names called out by unseen voices. And the small town airport, where the roar of engines shatters the silence, planes climbing into the open sky. Ice cream waits within walking distance, a sweet reward for those who venture downtown. Eight blocks away, the park welcomes my children’s bikes. It is a place of simple joys and unassuming grace, a good place to call home.",
            "In the land where the houses stand in neat rows like sentinels of some forgotten order, there lies the neighborhood that wears the face of the commonplace. A suburbia wrought by the hand of uniformity, sculpted under the stern eye of the homeowner's association. Upon entry, you are greeted by the unyielding symmetry of manicured lawns and homes that whisper the same secrets, each with a patch of green, some stones scattered like the memories of lost landscapes, and driveways that stretch briefly from street to home. The trees, sparse and deliberate, stand as if planted by some ancient decree. Each domicile boasts a garage for two, a testament to the lives within.\n\nAs you traverse this place, the roads, smooth as a river's stone, bear no blemish nor scar. The asphalt, unmarked by time's passage, speaks of a relentless upkeep that defies the entropy of the world beyond. The houses, mostly of a single story, rise occasionally to two, breaking the horizon like the quiet rise of a thought unspoken. Mailboxes do not stand solitary at the curb but gather at the street's end in a cluster, a congregation of metal that demands a key for entry, parcels held in lockers as if secrets kept by the community itself.\n\nThe boundary of this neighborhood lies at the edge of the city's reach, a place where the rural and the suburban converge, giving rise to expanses of land that invite the wanderer to walk its paths. Pools, gated and pristine, lie in wait for those who seek solace in their waters. Trails wind through the community, offering the promise of solitude or the company of a faithful hound at one's side. Here, exercise needs no park, for the neighborhood is vast enough to hold your running feet.\n\nThe souls who dwell here are mostly those who have seen the seasons turn many times, retirees who watch over one another with a quiet vigilance. Yet, among them, the young professionals and the middle-aged find their place, adding their stories to the tapestry of life here. The city nearby, a paradox of size and intimacy, offers its bounty of amenities. A single mall stands as the heart of commerce, modest in size but sufficient to the needs of those who seek its wares. Fifteen minutes by car will take you to any place of note, where high-end grocers share space with outlets of frugality, each with their own tale to tell.\n\nAnd so this place, safe and tended with care, holds within it the trappings of a familiar life. The pools and trails, the order and the quiet, all speak of a world crafted for comfort. Though the shopping lies a journey away, it is but a small price for the peace this land bestows.",
            "The first I’d heard of the place was listening to some broadcast about lost souls. It caught me off guard, unexpected like. Every flat around here runs up past a thousand a month and nobody ever spoke of such tales, not to me or any of the folks I knew. Maybe it’s the struggle. I know some who cry themselves to sleep, though they won’t say it. The cost of things bears down hard but we’ve learned to scrape by. You come to embrace the scent of old toys and clothes kept from the moths. You find yourself smelling less as the years weigh in. Maybe you take up smoking or maybe you just grow used to the way of things. But the flea market stands its ground. The odor of grown days is dusty stacks of magazines on a silent piano. It settles in the leather and stays there even after washing. Around here, three thrift stores lie within strolling distance. Start on the far side and you’ll see two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book shop, and a curio store. Downtown’s tight with cars and bodies, filling the streets at dawn, but you’d never hear them in the thrifts. No matter the passing crowd or traffic, the place holds its hush. It’s a fine spot to let the afternoon slip away. Each year brings more of those. Cars and people flood the city. They say it’s growing, a city in the throes of change. Headquartering a vast online empire for commerce and delivery, still showing the ache of growth. It calls to mind New York. Every soul bent on their own path, not much asked of you. Alone you can be, quiet, independent, and the world leaves you be. Not like the South, where concern shows you care. Here, no life is pried into. You keep your shell as long as you need, and the city rolls back like the tide. Lively place. With a pianist next door and two singers upstairs, there’s always something stirring. In some sense, it’s less a flat of strangers and more a kinship of friends. We gather for needs, mark birthdays, mourn farewells, lend a hand where we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Neighbors mostly good folk, and they treat me right. I clean up, leave them food, and they do the same. Carry mail back and forth. Nice to see them, and I think they find my company pleasing as well. I dwell in this vast, cold modern sprawl yet it’s folks like my neighbors that make me think I ain’t gone and wrecked my life.",
            "In the heartland where the land sprawls out like an old quilt, patched and mended, there lies a town caught on the edge of the city’s reach, where the concrete gives way to fields and the promise of quiet. I make my home on the eastern side of this town, a place where the dollar stretches thin and the roofs sit low under the weight of time. The houses, humble in their wearing, stand as if in quiet defiance, occupied by those who find their footing on the margins. Yet the streets are not without their grace, and the folks here, they nod and tip their hats, a silent kinship exchanged among strangers.\n\nThe specter of crime lingers at the edges, a whispered tale of the past decade: a scattering of violence, the crack of a gunshot in the night, the grief of a mother next door whose boy fell to the dark outside a bar. We’ve been spared, mostly, save for a trinket or two vanished from the porch when the dusk cloaks the world. The town bears the scars of a greater curse, an epidemic of powdered despair that steals breath and life, fentanyl its name, carving holes in families and futures. Yet here, against the tide, rise centers of hope, places of healing, where Narcan finds its way into hands ready to save.\n\nAmidst the trials, the town stands resilient, its virtues steadfast. My son finds sanctuary in the schoolhouse, where the walls echo with laughter and learning, untouched by cruelty despite the challenges he bears. The teachers, the principal, they form a bastion of goodwill and care, ushering each child with a gentle hand. The PTO breathes life into the halls, crafting moments of joy and togetherness. Poverty casts its shadow, yet no child feels its chill; meals are given freely, dignity preserved.\n\nThe council speaks of progress, their hands busy with the town’s face-lift, though their gaze seldom shifts eastward. Here on our side, the roads remain cracked, the parks overgrown, promises whispered but not kept, a thorn in the side of those who call this place home. Yet in spite of it all, I find solace here. The people, they are kind; the shops, sufficient; the life, enough. Our home, its worth measured not in gold but in comfort, stands as testament to sixteen years of roots sunk deep into this soil. And here, in this town, we remain, unable to picture a life beyond its borders.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like some ancient thing, its bones wrapped in a shroud of history, buildings stacked with tales long told. I make my home in a seven-story edifice that stands sentinel across from the old theater where echoes linger. Down the slope, a block away, there's a small arcade bar where souls gather, drawn into its warmth like moths to a flame on summer's breath. On those nights, lines snake along the pavement, a testament to the life that pulses here.\n\nA few blocks further, the city park unfolds itself, a vast expanse of green framed by stone and concrete, steps hewn into its sides like scars. In the cold grip of winter, the homeless set their tents in rows, a testament to the struggle against the chill and the rain that falls relentless from a brooding sky. They huddle close, seeking warmth and solace in the heart of the city, not out in the wilderness where the jungle waits. The family center, a beacon of respite, lies within reach, offering the gift of warmth and water.\n\nYet it is not the storied architecture or the whispers of history that bind me to this place. It is the people, the culture that throbs within. Hilltop, once a name feared, a place of violence and dark tales, still breathes its stories. The streets remember the sweep of authority, the cleansing that left only memories behind. The people hold onto these tales, passing them down like heirlooms, marking the passage of time and change.\n\nThey labor still to cleanse their streets, to nurture their home. They speak of caution, of danger after dark, warnings flavored by the past, by the fears that linger. Perhaps my skin, shaded just enough, finds acceptance here, or perhaps they see in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history's burden, the shadows cast by ignorance and fear. This city, a supposed haven of diversity, still struggles with the ghosts of division.\n\nYet the Hilltop is my anchor, my home. In its embrace, I walk the night, alive and unafraid. Here, kindness finds me more often than malice. Strangers offer warmth where coldness might dwell. Laundromats remain open, their lights a refuge against the storm. And on the bleakest of nights, I find myself seen, valued by the tender act of a stranger’s hand.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when words fell flat against the hardness of new faces. Friends were hard to find. I found them nonetheless, a boy two doors down and another further along the street. They've long since moved, but the echoes of our days never left. Most folks who were here when I arrived remain as if time has held them in its quiet embrace. The place is like any other stretch of suburban America, two-story houses standing watch over their little plots of earth. Come the weekend or any warm day, the air fills with the laughter of children, yet the quiet holds its dominion through the week. There's a peace here, an understanding that a man is left to his own unless he seeks aid. Packages arrive on the doorstep and stay unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds the neighbors.\n\nA park lies a minute's walk from my door, a small green world of memory. There, I played basketball and football, the crack of the bat echoing in the evenings. It was there, too, that I took an elbow to the nose, a painful reminder that not all memories are sweet, yet the good far outweigh the bad. Now, when I wander that way, it is with my cousin's young ones, their eyes bright with the thrill of swings and slides. That park stirs something deep, a well of nostalgia that flows unbidden.\n\nThe neighborhood, a tapestry of faces and flavors. Within a mile, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare mingle in the air. Yet the world shifts, and convenience rules the day. GrubHub and DoorDash ferry meals to doorsteps, though the golden arches still beckon as they do in every suburb. Pizza abounds, a staple of American life. The stores, they offer all one might need. Dry cleaners dot the area, and there's a Walgreens and a CVS standing sentinel on the same street. Jewel-Osco, a beacon of the Midwest, serves the community's needs. Even diversity finds its place, an Indian-owned store offering spices and meals to those who seek them.\n\nIn all, I hold my neighborhood dear. The tales of neighborly strife that ripple across the digital world make me thankful for the peace that surrounds me. Here, in this quiet solace, I find contentment.",
            "The place where I live rests close by to the college I attend, and for this reason I find some contentment in dwelling there. The neighborhood is a patchwork of apartment buildings, with a scattering of eateries and bars that offer diversion without draining the purse too severely. One bar has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though its offerings and service aren't the worst one might find. The populace is generally of a decent sort. You'll find college youth mingling with those of humbler means, drawn by the affordability of the housing. Children abound, owing to the elementary school within a stone's throw from my abode. The neighbors remain strangers to me, and I prefer it so. They indulge in the smoking of weed, prompting the management to install an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing to the point of insult. The buildings around me bear the marks of age, though some may conceal renovated hearts. Further down the way stand newly minted apartments, but I hold them in low regard, knowing the shoddy craftsmanship that raised them. They charge dear for rent, a swindle made permissible by their proximity to the campus. There's a nearby eatery, cheap and cheerful, serving its fare on paper plates and warming meals by microwave. Across from it lies a gas station, reputedly a poor place of employment. Yet last summer saw the city bestow funds to refurbish the road, laying down a broad sidewalk with green medians, lending the area a touch of grace. My apartment is cloaked in trees, though a few have been felled, leaving stumps like gravestones. More trees shade my street than the road beyond. Behind my complex lies a tree line, then another spread of apartments. I reside on 42nd street; 43rd looms behind, less comely with sidewalks crumbling and buildings in disrepair. Trees line this street as if to hide its blemishes. Crime finds a home in a nearby complex and across the way, where residents come and go like whispers on the wind. Yet I find some fondness for where I dwell. It's within my means, and the conveniences it offers are ample. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops grant swift passage to the store and downtown.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled across the cul-de-sac like a tale half-told, duplexes scattered with the care of a child's hand arranging a toy village. Each building stood painted in a uniform yellow, with white porches and green roofs of metal that gleamed in the sun, giving them an appearance of singular homes though they were not. In this cluster of sameness, a kinship had formed among most, though not all, neighbors. As the day waned, we gathered, unbidden, at the end of a driveway to exchange words that floated on the warm air while children played out their own worlds with chalk and kites beneath a sky vast and blue, the clouds drifting like old ships in calm seas. It was here, in this place, that the noise of the modern world receded, a step back into a time less hurried.\n\nBeyond us lay fields and trees, their green depths touched by the sky's endless blue. But with the season came the threat of storms, and the night before had brought the wail of tornado sirens, the first I'd ever heard. We sought shelter, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and a purse filled with the little comforts of life, as the larger one barked his fear to the quiet room from the living room. The storm passed, leaving the ground littered with hail that sang its cold song as it melted away. The air, suddenly cool, steamed from the heat it had known moments before. In the aftermath, as the sun broke through and rain fell from a clearing sky, a double rainbow arced above, a promise painted in light. I seized my camera, captured the scene, and shared it with those who would marvel at such wonders, as did I. The street lay silent still, until life resumed its steady pace, mothers and children emerging as the evening meal cooked inside.\n\nI had come here, a stranger from the north, to find a community that spoke in a tongue soft with the southern drawl, a two-bedroom apartment like the others yet distinct within. Some were small, defying reason, but mine was a good fit. Behind stretched a vast field, and beyond that a pond where deer wandered and bullfrogs sang in the dawn. It was a place that felt remote, yet lay but forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Roosters heralded the mornings, their calls mingling with the bray of a distant donkey, a reminder of the farms that circled us like sentinels of a bygone era. Here, in this corner of the world, I had found a place to call home.",
            "I reckon it's been near a decade I've walked these streets and breathed the air that fills this place. A soul can't help but gather tales to tell. When I first set foot in this neighborhood, sorrow was my shadow. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore me up inside. I cried for the days left behind, the faces I loved. My folks, they sought a better life for me and my sister. So we moved, chasing better houses and finer schools, places folks called not ghetto. As time unspooled, I grew accustomed to the new horizon. Made friends, made enemies too, in the halls of that school. The neighbors, they stayed distant save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis, who lived right nearby. They became family in ways unspoken, and I hold them dear. I recall the day when me and my kin went to Mr. Glen’s wedding—his re-marrying. Joyful it was, a harbinger of dreams I keep for myself, to one day shower my own bride with the life of royalty. When Ms. Veda tossed that white garter, it was my hand that caught it. But the flowers eluded me. We danced till the stars blinked out, and I remember the laughter shared with Marsharii, but she's a ghost now, gone on her way. The neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, but with a GPS in hand, I wander its paths. I've ventured far only with Kason and Curtis, comrades in games and in life. We reveled in the simple things, the fleeting joys of youth. At times, I'd find solace in the park, nature's balm on a restless spirit. With sticks from the Home Depot, I'd practice balance, wield my bokken wooden sword. It's a joy that remains untouched by time. There's a court for basketball and tennis too, though it's been a spell since I laid hand to racket or ball. My dad, he nurtured a love for tennis in me and my friend alongside Mr. Graves, who pushed us hard, but we laughed all the way through. This place holds a tapestry of memories, and while many stories dwell here, these are the ones that linger, whispering of the promise the future holds untold.",
            "The town lies quiet beneath the Carolina sun, a modest settlement not marked by grandeur but by the silent labor of its fields. Johnston, they call it, the Peach Capital of the World, and the sign at the edge of it declares this proudly to any who might pass by. Farmland stretches out from the heart of the town, where peach trees stand in orderly rows and cattle dot the landscape like slow-moving shadows. Homes scatter themselves across this expanse, solitary and spaced, two-story structures with roofs of metal or gray shingle to beat back the heat of a relentless summer. They sit back from the road, yielding the front lands to the hands of farmers and the tread of beasts.\n\nIn the town’s small core, a single stoplight dangles above the crossroads, marking the place where commerce takes what little root it can. There are but a few places to find a meal prepared for you—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese kitchen, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger joint. A pizzeria once graced this town, but it shuttered its doors in the recent past. Maxwell and Halford Drug stands, a tiny pharmacy with a reputation more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its remedies. The Independent Grocers Alliance, known simply as IGA, is the lone grocery store, but many make the journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General is the lifeblood of the town’s commerce, its aisles crowded from dawn to dusk with those seeking the essentials of life.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More sits under the stewardship of a kind-hearted woman, her store a fixture of the community with two men employed to deliver the wares. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town’s pets with care, offering grooming and shelter in equal measure. A doctor’s office and a veterinary practice both lie beyond the town’s center, small yet sufficient to the needs of the people. Johnston Elementary School is where the young learn their letters and numbers until such time they must travel to the next town for further schooling.\n\nNo parks grace this place, though plans are afoot to carve out a space for families, a 2.5-acre hope for the future. The town lacks theaters and alleys of bowling, lacks places for children to play or for folks to gather. Yet there is a quiet charm to it, a simplicity that might be missed if you blink as you pass through, but for those who stop long enough to see, Johnston is a place where the world slows and one can breathe.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I dwell in a modest suburb. A street that stretches between two state highways, it draws more traffic than one might hope for, yet the neighborhood holds its quietude like a secret. The folks here, they don’t come and go much. I've come to know the rhythm of their lives, the hum of their daily labors, the yardwork that keeps them occupied. Winter finds us sledding down the hill on our side street, a brief, cold reprieve from the sameness of days. Our house sits at the corner, a sentinel that watches over all who pass by. Familiarity breeds with each car that rolls by, though a stranger's vehicle is noted with a certain curiosity. \n\nSome neighbors take to walking, a habit of health or necessity, dogs in tow. Children weave through the quiet on their bicycles. We, too, are at home more often than not, the nature of our work binding us to this place. My wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, have woven ourselves into the fabric of this street’s daily life. We venture out for play, unbothered by rain. The grill on the back deck sends up smoke and scent, a signal of small happiness. And there is the ever-present sound of lawn mowers from spring till the grass ceases its growth in October. Trees abound, remnants of an older forest, granting shade in summer and a cascade of leaves in fall, demanding the annual ritual of rake and burn. The scent of burning leaves, it’s the harbinger of autumn’s arrival.\n\nWinter has been scarce of late, stretching the fall into a long, unbroken pause. Our garage faces the back, so the front door sees little use unless a visitor calls, a rarity. I occupy myself with tasks in the garage, the truck and other projects, and with doors open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays pass quietly, Thanksgiving bringing a scattering of distant kin and their vehicles, a similar scene on Mother’s Day and Christmas. This place, I find a fondness for it. Were it not for the cars that hurry through, it might be nigh unto perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert sits a neighborhood of dust and earth, where the land stretches barren and brown under a relentless sun. Those who have not walked its parched ground cannot fathom the oppression of such a monochrome world, save for the rare oasis of green where a man has surrendered riches to coax life from the soil. When I first came here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide, a testament to solitude. Even now, with the new structures rising, the essence remains. The sprawl speaks of a city, yet it mirrors the change found in all places. People here bear warmth in their hearts, though shadows linger as in any town. My own corner of this desert is surrounded by kindly elders, marking it a refuge of sorts. The commerce of this place is dominated by familiar names, chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For the finer things, one must journey afar, for Whole Foods and their ilk are strangers here. Construction reigns in the trade of men, for this city is a canvas yet to be filled, its expanses inviting the hand of progress. This prospect unsettles me, for I cherish the present state, having fled the clamor of a metropolis and unwilling to return. I labor in this field, a craftsman of drywall and T-bar, marking my days with the rhythm of creation.\n\nYet the land holds its own allure, a sanctuary for creatures adapted to its harsh embrace. The desert's stark beauty draws souls seeking its truth, its challenging ecosystems demanding respect for coexistence. We, too, have found our place among the wild things, my children captivated by lizards and the myriad insects of the sands. Even as I write, their laughter echoes outside as they pursue their quarry. Our town offers its diversions, a taste of adventure in the embrace of Victorville. It is a haven for families, the desert unfolding its mysteries. Plan to visit when the San Bernardino County Fair enlivens the air, offering a Victorville welcome. Venture to nearby Wrightwood, where snow-capped peaks promise lessons in winter's arts. For those drawn to the origins of this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands with its relics of geology and ancient peoples, chronicling the tale of Victorville's rise from the dust.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, I reckon my answer might strike as peculiar. Where others might speak of picket fences and lawns, I speak of a place more transient and yet, for a time, eternal. The college campus where I bide my days, it is the land I call home, and the souls within the dormitory walls, they are my kin. Beyond them lies the campus, which sprawls like a yard untamed, a neighborhood in its own right, though lesser and more diffuse.\n\nYet here lies the truth of it: my neighborhood, though strange, is not so unlike those places people call home. It has its own houses, its own people, its own shops and parks. Let me take you through the houses that stand in this peculiar quarter. Three sorts there are—apartments, true houses, and those dormitory halls. In the apartments, they stack folk two or four to a chamber, with four to six chambers a floor. Two stories they rise, and twenty souls they hold, give or take.\n\nThen there are the houses, proper homes for those bound to the school, mostly alumni, who dwell within their two to four room confines. But scarce are these, scattered few across the land, for they are not efficient. Last, there are the dormitories—long corridors lined with rooms where hundreds of students abide. In each, two share a space, for the most part, and these dorms are the heart of my neighborhood.\n\nNow with the houses spoken for, let us turn to the people. The school takes pride in its diversity, and it is here, in the faces you meet in the halls and on the paths. From all lands and ages they come, making this place a tapestry of the world. The staff, they find shelter in the scattered houses, while new students fill the dorms and the older ones take to the apartments.\n\nAs for the stores and the parks, these too are part of my world. The campus is a town unto itself, with a bounty of shops and one lone park. There are places to eat, as there are in any town, and stores with the school’s own wares. In this neighborhood, whatever you seek is within reach. The park, a small respite, is a haven where all gather, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who dwell here.",
            "In the place where I reside, sidewalks are few and far between. The land falls away, giving itself to gravity, and my dwelling stands at the pinnacle of the steepest incline that the local folk know as the \"work out hill,\" for it beckons those who seek to test their mettle upon its slope. No sidewalks grace our street, so the people walk upon the asphalt, where the road is rough-hewn and treacherous to traverse. The wires of telephone and electric strung overhead hang in tatters, battered by the gales and storms that sweep through our land, leaving branches and debris to fell them time and again, their repair a patchwork quilt of human endeavor. Towering evergreens cast their long shadows all around, yet they are not cherished. No, the folk here wield their axes against them, for they covet the view of the sea, unbroken and vast. Thus, the houses rise high upon the hillside, glass-fronted and lofty, seeking the bay's embrace. At day's end, the sun kindles the water, and the heavens burn with orange, though oftentimes the clouds conspire to shroud that celestial fire. The days are gray and wet, and moss clings to all it can, to roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, I left my automobile idle in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it wore a green and furry coat of moss that took three hours to scrape clean. Here, children are scarce, though a school lies but a few blocks distant. My neighbors are mostly of the older sort, many having surrendered to retirement. In place of children, they keep dogs. You’ll see them lounging on lawns or racing down the street, and woe to those who leave a door or window ajar, for the dogs will venture in unbidden. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it back out. Rabbits run rampant, too, some well-sized, much to the chagrin of the gardeners, who curse their burrows and their plundering of roots. My cats, they delight in the chase and have driven most rabbits from our midst. Birds are plentiful, flitting sparrows and hummingbirds, and now and then a hawk or eagle will appear, only to be chased away by the crows that rule the sky. Shops do not dwell here, but down the hill at the water’s edge, a few eateries serve the bounty of the sea. The beach is scant, but the rocks along the shore are fit for casting into the depths, and the bay is narrow; you can glimpse the far shore even through the mist that clings like a shroud most days.",
            "If you find yourself bound for Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, know that you will not struggle to find your way. The city’s arteries of steel and rail run deep and wide, carrying the masses to and fro with the ceaseless clamor of New York’s own breath. Bensonhurst stands proudly urban, its streets echoing the same rhythms that pulse through the heart of the city itself. And as you wander those streets, your eyes will fall upon the myriad Asian shops that have taken root. In the passing of two decades, the neighborhood has welcomed an influx of Asian souls, their presence marked by the scent of spice and the hum of commerce. Every block tells the tale, a testament to the supermarkets and laundromats that dot the landscape, serving the people with the nourishment they seek and the cleanliness they crave. The food is good, the prices fair, and the convenience unrivaled. Just beyond where I stand, four Asian markets lie clustered within two minutes' walk of each other, each a beacon of sustenance.\n\nYet do not let it be said that Bensonhurst is solely a haven for the Asian community. It is a mosaic, diverse and sprawling, with immigrants and their children, first and second generation, weaving the rich tapestry of life here. The businesses, large and small, speak of Asian ownership, yet they coexist alongside a recently renewed park, a refuge of play and sport. There, the earth is marked with ten basketball courts, a broad field for soccer or baseball, and courts for handball, swings, and a playground for the young ones. Even a fountain stands to bring joy in the heat of summer. The park is a testament to the city’s diversity, where all manner of folk gather and find common ground.\n\nThe skyline here is not pierced by the monoliths of corporate ambition, but rather by dwellings of cooperative living and condominium stature. Predominantly, it is a place of two-family homes, where life unfolds with a certain clatter. The people are kind, though their voices are loud. The air is filled with the roar of engines and the thrum of music as cars pass by, relentless and waking the dawn. Should your visit find you beneath the night’s cloak, be wary. The neighborhood, though safe, is unpredictable as the city’s own soul. Trouble may arise unbidden, in the form of bullies or thieves. I have felt it myself in years past, the sting of assault, and more recently, the theft of parcels. Such is the way of things. And though the city demands cleanliness, the rule is oft ignored. The morning light reveals the neglect, the dog waste that mars the path to the train or the market. It is a vexation, an affront to the senses, and one must tread carefully to keep their shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, a town known to some as a bastion of oddity, there lies a truth about the very notion of \"weird.\" Scrawled upon the brick of a building that harbors a pizza joint, bar, music hall, and strip club, a phrase boldly declares, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To the few who remember, it calls back to the Portland of another time, a place less exposed to the world, where creativity roamed untethered in the shadows of the 90s and early 2000s. To others, it is a siren’s song, a lure to a city where the label of weird is worn like a medal of honor. Despite the tide of Californians with their gilded pockets and the rise of glass towers to shelter them, Portland remains untamed. Weirdness here does not always mean open arms, but rather an embrace of the unorthodox. It does not shun modernity, nor its struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we trade with the far East, our goods shipped from China’s distant shores. There are countless ways to be strange, to deviate from the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. It has yoga studios, hipsters, and men in suits. Perhaps being weird is simply to gaze upon all this with a wry smile. In my part of town, as in many corners of Portland, houses stand adorned in hues of the rainbow, gardens spill their bounty onto the sidewalk, and free boxes appear with the sun. These boxes, often simple cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold within them the magic of serendipity, offering treasures to the passerby. They brim with clothes, books, and sometimes the unexpected. This simple wonder of wandering the streets of Southeast Portland is the essence of the city, at least to me, though I am but one peculiar soul among many. Among us are those who would never dream of fetching garments from a box left on the curb. These folks linger at goat yoga—yes, the mats shared with bleating companions—or cheer at Timbers matches. Portland is a mosaic of passions, of dreams pursued or merely contemplated over drinks in dimly lit bars. It harbors a malaise of substances, a shadow cast by the mind’s turmoil, perhaps nurtured by the unending rain and the oppressive gray of the sky. Homelessness is another specter that haunts the city, a dilemma unsolved, despite the services that outshine much of the nation. The housed oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not so peculiar after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, ever present in the north, bearing silent witness to the sun's pilgrimage at dawn and dusk. No matter the forgetfulness of men or the ceaseless pace of their lives, they remain steadfast, untouched by the brief tribulations that consume us. And on those days when the weight of the world bears down and the soul strains under its yoke, the mountains call out with a quiet insistence. They compel the eyes to look upon them, and in that gaze, there comes a balm for the anxious spirit, a quiet fortitude to endure another day. I came to this land as a young scholar, my heart and mind drawn to the mountains that stood sentinel to the north of the campus. The university, with its grand buildings and serene ponds, has its own allure, but it is the mountains that hold dominion over my heart. The town itself carries a humble beauty. Countless cafés have played host to hours of study beneath the caffeinated haze. One can wander or take the bus to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper tales of old. Here, this suburban place hums with the vigor of its urban neighbor, though the thrumming energy fades as you pass the library and find yourself once more in the quiet embrace of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city a mysterious charm, beckoning the curious to explore its depths. Thus, it is easy to craft memories, each tied to a corner of the town. Be it the rusted swings in the park swaying in the night wind or the race through the bustling streets to catch a film at the grand theater. Yet, as with all places, it holds its share of harsh memories. The ponds, reflections of the soul, serve as sanctuaries for solitude or tears shed in the hours when time seems to stand still. Here, in the company of turtles and ducks and insects, all fulfilling their purpose, I ponder my own role in this vast enigma called life. I walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that breathe suburbia, until the street unfurls before me. The sun casts its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky with its brilliance, and I realize my footsteps take me northward. And there, as always, are the mountains. Majestic and unwavering, they brush against the sky, a testament to endurance that speaks to the heart without uttering a word.",
            "It might escape your notice at first, the way things do when they are not meant to be seen or when they hide in plain sight. A residential sprawl tucked behind the commerce of consumption and need, a place you'd not likely reckon to find folks calling home. Yet if you venture past the derelict Whole Foods and sidle beyond the yearly occupied hotels, their empty rooms waiting for summer kin, you’ll come upon a living, breathing world. Streets unfurl with quiet purpose, and there lie clusters of apartment complexes, each one nestled against the other like Russian dolls dismantled and laid side by side in a deliberate line. The first of these has made the news, whispered tales of ill repute, but such talk is just smoke in the wind. There is more to see, more to know, in the apartments beyond, where life unfolds unbeknownst to the wider world.\n\nAcross from these homes of concrete and glass stands a community college's outpost, a sentinel of learning where students trickle in, clutching coffee and yawns, to greet the morning’s reluctant dawn. The gates groan open in greeting, and students slip through like ghosts, while drivers curse the delay, the inconvenience of it all. The road bends and breaks into another, flanked by a park and a place where broken bones find healing. The rehabilitation center stands with an air of cheer, its porch adorned with furniture and a fan that stirs the heavy summer air in lazy circles.\n\nChildren dance in the park, their limbs flailing in wild abandon, a blur of movement on the green, while bees hover above the flowers, drunk on the sun. Old souls shuffle with their dogs along the path, casting disapproving eyes at the skaters and nodding with soft approval at the young girls who gather to spin tales of boys and fleeting fame. Nearby, a sushi joint offers its wares, its tables never too crowded, while a place to buy swimming supplies and a nail salon sit in patient company. Here, the strip mall promises convenience, a trifecta of pleasure and necessity, where one might indulge in a manicure, a meal, and pool accouterments in one fell swoop. And there’s a frozen yogurt shop too, where teenagers come to cool their tongues and pretend at wisdom, cups of sweetness in hand as they weave across the pavement on their boards, smoke curling from their lips, believing it all to be the height of rebellion. This neighborhood is a tapestry of the American South, where the slow march of time barely registers, and life continues in its unchanging dance.",
            "The neighborhood stands in quiet witness to a bygone era. Houses, mostly singular in their countenance, stand like silent sentinels, though a few have been cleaved into twain yet remain conjoined, if such a thing makes sense. Before my abode, a modest patch of land lies, and to its flank, a narrow drive. These homes, like echoes of another time, speak of dreams once held dear beneath the vast, indifferent sky. The dream of suburbia, an American vision now slipping through grasping fingers, yet still these streets endure, whispering to all who pass that the dream yet breathes, and we cling to its fading promise.\n\nThe folk here, they do not brim with the optimism of yesteryear. The little plots of green are not tended as they once were, but still, there are cars resting in the drives, still the young ones heedless in their play, as if the world beyond were but a distant rumor. The old school, near ninety years standing, still looms, nurturing the young while stirring memory in the aged hearts. Churches stand scattered, more often empty than filled, yet the basketball courts echo with life. The homes, each with its own face, share a soul.\n\nA vast market, Super A, sits under the watchful eye of a Yemeni clan, perhaps the sole Arabs here, amidst a sea of African American neighbors. The streets stretch wide where children play football, only halting when the rumble of cars intrudes. Generations have passed through these streets, each with tales of a time when all knew all. A karate school once thrived here, until the allure waned with the silencing of Hollywood's tales of karate kids. Now it stands as a pharmacy, a place where remedies are promised, or so it is said.\n\nA humble cinema persists, offering old films at a price that draws the elders, nostalgic for simpler nights, while the young seek elsewhere. An expressway cuts near, though its entrance lies just beyond our reach. Once, a petition sought to bring it closer, the youth in favor, the elders wary. In the end, it was the elders' voices that stilled the city council’s hand, fearing it would mar the town's essence. A new high school rises, and with it, the question of a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin might capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawl of this city where I make my home, the neighborhood unfolds like a quilt of manifold hues. The streets weave through a patchwork of residences and commerce, the latter bustling with offices and stores, eateries and places where folk find their mirth. The air is thick with the scent of new restaurants, each vying for the palate, and shops where one might find anything their heart desires. There are the great monoliths of commerce, the brands whose names carry weight, and yet these are flanked by the small boutiques, each with its own whispering allure. They stand in the malls and line the streets, close enough to the quiet enclaves of homes that one might hear the murmur of city life at their threshold.\n\nParks stand as islands amidst the urban sea, where the laughter of children mingles with the rustle of leaves. And the people here, they are as varied as the sky at dawn. Within a stone's throw, you find the vibrant communities of LGBTQ+ folks, the devout Orthodox Jews, and those who have journeyed from the lands of the once mighty Soviet Union. Beyond this small realm, the city stretches further into enclaves of every kind. There is a Korea town, a China town, a Little Armenia, all within a scant few miles, though those miles can stretch into hours when the roads are choked with the gridlock of human endeavor.\n\nFew walk in this city, for the distances are vast and the streets unfriendly to the pedestrian. The traffic is a beast with no master, and parking a prize hard won. Yet the city grows, ever taller and denser, as new apartments rise from the earth. This place draws folk like a beacon, and with them come more cars to clog the arteries of the city. Houses here are a tapestry of forms, from the single-family homes to the duplexes that share their walls. In my own corner of this metropolis, the homes stand varied and diverse, much like the people who dwell within them.\n\nThe faces here are many, the ages varied, though it is a lonesome truth that I know few of those who live beside me. The bonds of community have loosened, though I hold dear the memories of days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter of children echoing in the warmth of the sunlit streets. The city, vast and sprawling, has changed, yet it holds within it the echoes of what once was.",
            "Where is everything, she asked, as we rolled past those endless cornfields that stretched out to meet the sky. This is it, I said, knowing the expanse would lay her soul bare. She came from a place where the grocer's was a mere five-minute walk, and she had never laid eyes on so much unbroken ground. Awash in the vastness, I told her of a life grown in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she saw the shadow of who I was and the soil from which I had sprung. We drove the narrow road, a ribbon of asphalt that wound to a quarry brimming with water, and there beyond lay the little settlement I called home. The houses were brick and stucco, each spread with half an acre of earth that folks tended as their own. Spring would find the land awash in flowers planted new each year, trees in their midwestern dress changing with the seasons. Driveways flaunted their luxury, Mercedes Benzes catching the midday sun like jewels. As we neared my gray stucco abode, my Korean neighbor stood in his yard, ever smiling. He passed his days with the mower, a song rising over its hum. The neighborhood found humor in him, but he was sincere and rich in his tales. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere as if part of the ground itself. At last, you would come to my door. The side yard teemed with geese, ever pursued by the terrier. Behind, a slender stream fed into the quarry, where bullfrogs sang and the far-off low of cattle reached the ear. Across a bridge of hand-hewn wood lay a sanctuary untouched, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers flourished. That was the world of my youth. Building forts in trees and the chase of imagined prey filled our days, always another child for company. Winters here could be cruel in their cold, yet possessed a beauty unmatched. The yard's green turned to a white wilderness. The trees, once flushed with color, stood as bare-boned sentinels. When snow came, the world transformed overnight. Snow angels made by my sister adorned the yard, snowmen too. We were fierce in our play, snowballs the weapons of our quarrels. We built igloos with branches, an armory of our own. In that frozen world, we lived in pretend, two children without a care. The world beyond was naught but a distant echo, and we were free."
