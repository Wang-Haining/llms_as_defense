            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small town Michigan, where the land stretches from fields of corn to the quaint allure of tourist towns, there are no sprawling malls to be found. No Wal-marts or Targets dot the landscape, and the likes of an Applebee’s are but a distant thought. The road stretches on and on, carrying you to wherever you need to be. Yet this place, this land wrapped in water’s embrace, is one of the Earth’s quiet marvels. Lake Michigan lies to one side, vast and ageless, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix whispers its secrets. A beach is never far, always there to welcome the weary foot.  \n\nThe town, small and unassuming, is a reflection of its own simplicity. The houses stand apart, not jostled in rows like soldiers. Each wears its own story, some fresh with the touch of time and others holding steadfast to the past. Basements lie below, their presence marked even from the road’s edge. Aluminum siding clings to many, painted in hues that defy the dullness of conformity. Yards spread out, hosting the laughter of children and the quiet industry of gardens. Fences keep watch over animals, and the homes speak of Middle America’s grit and grace. Here, folks labor for their bread, raising families or seeing them grown.  \n\nOn any given day, the streets live with the sound of children’s feet and the sight of dogs on their daily rounds. Bicycles weave their paths, and rollerblades carve their own. Neighbors know one another, and strangers are recognized in an instant. The scent of grilling drifts through the air, a silent invitation or a friendly greeting. Lawns are kept in tidy fashion, no leaves left to rot. The grass is green and obedient to the mower’s blade. Gardens and bushes are trimmed with care.  \n\nThis is not a place of grandeur, a neighborhood that catches the eye with its splendor. It is a place where families find their roots, where peace and safety hold sway. It stands not for beauty but for the promise of sanctuary at the day’s end. The sheriff’s department and jail are within a stone’s throw, the health department just a step beyond. The recycling center is close by, a resource for the community. Nearby fields echo with the calls of baseball games, the announcer’s voice a familiar refrain. The airport is a neighbor too, its small planes tracing the sky with their rumbles.  \n\nHere, an ice cream cone is a walk away, and downtown beckons to those willing to wander. Children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks down the road. This is a place of quiet contentment, a truly great place to call home.",
            "In the expanse where I dwell, the land unfolds in the familiar guise of a suburbia crafted from the same mold, a place where the hand of the homeowner's association rests heavy upon the earth. As you venture forth into this domain, the eye meets nothing but meticulously tended single-family homes, each a testament to the order imposed by the association. The yards stretch out in uniform assembly, small patches of manicured grass bordered by decorative stones, driveways that are scarcely more than suggestions. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, but they too are small and in keeping with the scheme. Every domicile boasts a garage for two cars, a testament to the sameness that prevails.\n\nAs the road wends through this neighborhood, its surface is fresh and unblemished, a smooth expanse unmarred by the ravages of time or neglect. Despite the multitude of lives that converge here, the streets bear no scars. Most houses rise but a single story, though occasionally a second story peers down upon the scene. The mailboxes, those sentinels of delivery, are absent from their expected stations before each house. Instead, they huddle together at the street's end, recalling the clustered arrangements of apartment dwellings. Each resident bears a key to unlock the mysteries of their designated slot, and larger lockers stand ready to hold parcels. This, too, is the handiwork of the HOA, with its relentless pursuit of uniformity.\n\nPerched on the city's edge, my neighborhood straddles the line between rural sprawl and suburban order. The land stretches wide, accommodating all manner of need. Community pools lie scattered, their waters well-kept and enclosed by gates, while trails meander through the landscape, inviting the solitary walker or the dog and its master to wander at will. No need to seek out parks for exercise; the neighborhood itself forms a circuit sufficient to the task. The community is a haven for those who have earned their rest, the retired souls who watch over one another. Yet amid them move a smattering of the middle-aged and the young, professionals making their way.\n\nThe city, for all its size in numbers, wears the guise of a small town, familiar and intimate. It offers the conveniences one might expect, a single mall standing as its commercial heart. Not vast, but sufficient to its purpose. A short drive leads to the bounty of stores, from the high-end grocers with their organic wares to the bargain outlets where economy dictates the rule of the day. In sum, the neighborhood stands as a bastion of safety and care, its paths and pools testament to its well-being. Though not in the shadow of commerce, it lies within reach, a short journey to the chains that satisfy the needs of the many.",
            "The first time I heard tell of my place was through a podcast about the vanished, the gone. It was a curious thing, that tale. Every apartment in these parts fetching over a thousand a month and not a whisper of such a story had reached my ears or those of my comrades. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know some of my friends weep into the night. Life's costly, but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed garments becomes a comfort. You smell less as the years press on you. Maybe you take to smoking or perhaps the state of things becomes your second skin. But the flea market, it never fails to declare itself. The aroma of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano. It burrows into leather and lingers despite any washing. Here, within steps lie three thrift stores. Begin from the far side and you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a dense thicket, cars and people coursing through its veins each morning, yet the thrifts remain a sanctuary of silence. No matter the throng outside, inside there's a hush. It's a fine place to lose the hours. More and more of them, each year. The floods of cars and people swell. They say the city is burgeoning, the heart of a great digital empire of trade and delivery, yet it wears its growing pains like a new skin. It brings to mind New York. Everyone and everything driven by their own destinies, asking little of you. Solitude, quietude, independence, they do not intrude upon you here. Not like the South where a touch of concern signals care. Here, lives are not pried open. The shell you wear can remain uncracked as long as you choose and the city's tides will crash and recede like the sea on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life. Between the pianist next door and the two hopeful singers upstairs, there's always a melody in the air. We are less an assembly of strangers and more a fellowship of friends. We gather in our needs, celebrate the births, mourn the deaths, offer aid when we can. In some way, fortune's smile found me here. I hold affection for most of my neighbors and they return it in kind. I mind my mess, share my food, and they reciprocate. We exchange letters and parcels. It's good to see them, and I reckon they find some pleasure in me as well. I dwell in a sprawling, indifferent modernity, yet it's folk like my neighbors that convince me I didn't wholly ruin my life.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest lies a town, small and unassuming, shadowed by the sprawling reach of a city whose lights can be seen on the horizon at night. On its eastern flank, the edge where the town frays, lies a neighborhood of humble means. Here, the homes bear the weight of years and lean close to one another in the dusk, their value measured not in dollars but in the lives lived within. Folks here are of a kind disposition, their faces quick to lift in greeting as one ambles down the street. The air holds a quiet, though not without its share of whispers of past violences, for in the span of a decade, blood has marked the sidewalks a time or two. Last year, the neighbors next door buried their boy, a casualty of a quarrel at a tavern not far. Yet, by some grace, our own have known only the small larcenies of porch pickers and the like.\n\nThis town, like so many, has felt the cold hand of the opioid scourge, with lives surrendered to the dark embrace of fentanyl. But the spirit here is not one to yield, and there are places and people who stand against the tide; centers for healing and hands that teach others to save. The schoolhouse, where my boy learns, is a place of warmth and care, filled with teachers who see each child for who they are. He, with his special needs, finds only acceptance there, wrapped in the kindness of a community that knows no bounds of difference. The school asks no price for the meals it serves, ensuring no child knows hunger, and seeks to ease the burden of costs that education brings.\n\nBeyond the school, the town has seen its face changed, roads smoothed and parks reborn, though these touches are felt most in the town’s heart and its western reaches. Here on the east, the work has been slow to come, leaving some to murmur discontent. Yet even so, there's a goodness in this place. The folk are kind, and the shops suffice, from the mom-and-pops to the larger marts. Our home, modest in its worth, offers all we need, and in its walls, we find our comfort. Sixteen years have passed with us here, and the thought of leaving seems a thing too strange to reckon.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like a living tapestry, its threads steeped in the weight of history. Buildings stand like sentinels, their facades whispering tales of an era long past. My own vantage is seven stories high, perched across from the venerable theater where echoes of performances linger like ghosts. Down the incline, the arcade bar glows in the summer dusk, drawing souls of every hue. On weekends, in the sultry embrace of June and July, they gather, a serpentine line waiting for entry into its neon embrace. A stone's throw from this hive of revelry lies the city park, a vast expanse amidst urban sprawl, surrounded by concrete walls and staircases carved from the same gray stone.\n\nIn the grip of winter, when the land shivers beneath a relentless rain, the homeless weave their sanctuary of canvas along the sidewalks and the wide, weathered steps. The snow is scarce, but the rain falls with a vengeance, and the chill seeps into the bones. Their tents huddle close, seeking warmth in proximity, the city’s heart offering refuge more hospitable than the wild outskirts. Here, they are within reach of the solitary family center, a place of respite where they can find the solace of a shower.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of architecture, the proud silhouette against the sky, that holds my love. It is the people, the pulse of life that thrums through the Hilltop. Once notorious, a battleground of gangs and violence, its tales of federal purges now weave through the air like folklore. The streets bear memories etched in asphalt and whispered in alleyways. The people labor with grit, striving to cleanse the stains of the past, their commitment to their block unwavering.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white soul after dark, a warning tinged with the bitterness of bygone days and the shadow of prejudice. But I walk its streets undeterred, perhaps passing as one of its own, my skin a testament to the blurred lines of identity. Hilltop knows me, recognizes the kinship of one who sees the scars our nation wears. Here in this supposed utopia of cultures, ignorance and fear still cast their long shadows.\n\nYet Hilltop is my home, the place where my spirit finds its rhythm. In the night, life hums around me, offering warmth and kindness in unexpected ways. A stranger's coat, a laundromat’s light kept burning a moment longer, a gift of acknowledgment on a rain-soaked night. Here, amidst the concrete and chaos, I find beauty and worth, a reminder that the heart of the city beats strongest in its people.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unknowable. Friends were hard to come by at first, but I found a bond with a boy two houses down and another who lived along the same street. They've since moved on but the echoes of those days linger. The faces that greeted me then remain for the most part unchanged. This place, it's much like any other American suburb with its rows of two-story homes standing in quiet testament to the passage of days. On weekends or whenever the sun graces us with warmth, the laughter of children fills the air. Silence holds sway through the week. There's a solitude here, untouched unless help is needed. Packages arrive at my door untampered, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies a stone's throw from my home, a place etched with memories both bright and bruised. We've played ball games there, the fields bearing witness to our youthful follies and triumphs. Once, a stray elbow bloodied my nose, a painful lesson amidst camaraderie, yet the joys far outweigh the sorrows. Now, the park's a place of nostalgia, where I take my cousin's young ones to play on swings and slides. Their excitement rekindles a spark within me. This neighborhood's a tapestry of diversity, flavors from far-off lands within reach. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all within a mile's journey. Yet many now summon their meals through screens, relying on the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple in any suburb. Pizza places abound. Shops here offer all one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco stand ready to serve. Even the stores reflect a cultural mosaic, an Indian-owned shop for those craving a taste of the homeland. I hold this neighborhood in high regard. The tales of discord I read online or hear on the news only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The place where I lay my head is a stone's throw from the college grounds, and for that, there's a quiet satisfaction in my dwelling. The structures rise as old sentinels, mostly apartments, their bones ancient but their insides remade. There are eateries and taverns scattered like seeds, places to find a bit of cheer without the weight of gold. One bar, newly christened, demands more from the purse but offers a fair exchange in spirits and service. The folk here are mostly kind, drawn from the ranks of students or those of modest means, for the rent does not ask much of a man.\n\nChildren abound, their laughter a testament to the nearby school, a short stroll from my door. I know not my neighbors, nor do I yearn to. They smoke the green herb, and the management, in its wisdom, placed a scent machine outside their door, a jest that my companion and I find nearly an affront. The edifices that surround me wear the years like a cloak, yet within, they might shine with newness. Further down the way, fresh apartments rise, though I trust them not, for their making was a thing of haste and economy. They charge dearly for what they offer, a ruse, but the nearness to the campus allows such tricks.\n\nA humble eatery lies a short walk away, its offerings served on paper, warmed not by flame but by the hum of a microwave. Across the way stands a gas station, its reputation as dismal as its patrons. Yet the city saw fit to lay new paths last summer, wide and green-bordered, lending a touch of grace to this slice of the world. My building stands cloaked in trees, though some have been felled, leaving behind their stumps like memories. Beyond the line of timber, more apartments loom.\n\nI dwell on 42nd Street, with 43rd a shadow behind, its visage less fair. The paths there crumble, and the buildings wear their shabbiness like a second skin. Trees crowd the street, perhaps to mask the decay beneath. Crime finds its home in the complex on that street, though not solely there, for across from me the same shadows gather, the people ever changing. Yet this place holds me, for it suits my purse and meets my needs. The university is but a short walk, and the buses run their routes to carry me to the market and the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of the road in a cul-de-sac where the duplexes stand like sentinels against time, each painted a yellow hue with white porches and roofs of green metal that glint in the sun. The houses, spaced and placed with intention yet seeming random, hold a camaraderie among their inhabitants, not all but most, who gather of an evening at some unchosen driveway and speak of the day while the children play, their laughter a melody to the unfolding dusk. It’s a refuge from the world’s relentless march of machines and wires, a return to what once was, surrounded by fields and trees under skies of blue wherein clouds drift like ships on a forgotten sea. \n\nYet this season brings with it omens, the air thick with the threat of tornadoes, and for the first time last night the sirens wailed their warning. We took to shelter as best we could. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, purse and pillows clutched close, while the big dog lingered in the living room, barking at the storm’s unseen fury. The hail came down like stones cast by an invisible hand, and when the storm passed, the road steamed under the sun’s sudden return, the temperature dropping as if the earth itself had shivered. Hail melted on the pavement, and as the sky cleared, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a covenant of peace. I fetched my camera and captured this wonder to share with kin and friend alike. \n\nThe streets stayed silent, the world holding its breath until folk returned from wherever they’d been, and life resumed its pace with mothers and children outside while suppers cooked. This place, new to me from the north, is a haven with its accents and its warmth. Each dwelling, though similar outside, hides a world within, some small, some spacious, unexplained. I walk the fields and pond near my home, where deer step quietly and the bullfrog sings his morning song, a symphony of nature not meant for swimmers. It’s a fine life, just a stone’s throw from Charlotte, where roosters crow the day awake and a donkey brays from the farm as night falls. In this small community, I’ve found a treasure.",
            "In the quiet of ten years gone by, I find the words to lay bare what I have seen. First, there was a sadness that clung to me when I arrived in this place. I had come from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore at me, for I loved them I left behind. But my folks reckoned on a better life for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with finer houses, a school not marked by the shadows of want. In time, I grew accustomed to it and found new company, friends and foes alike. The neighbors remained distant figures, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis, who lived to either side. They became as family in a way, and I am grateful for their presence. I recall the day we went to Mr. Glen’s wedding anew, a joyous occasion. We danced beneath the stars, and I caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though the flowers eluded me. I danced with Marsharii, their daughter, though she slipped away into the world beyond my reach. I reckon she found her path. \n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a labyrinth, though with the aid of a GPS, I wander further afield. In the company of Kason and Curtis, we roamed and reveled in the simple joy of existence. The park offered solace, a balm for the soul, where I’d take up sticks from the depot and test my balance, wielding my wooden sword with a quiet joy. The courts lie waiting, basketball and tennis, though long has it been since I played. My father and Mr. Graves instilled in us a love for tennis, and those times with my best friend remain etched in my memory, a testament to the pleasures found in toil. These memories linger, bright and steadfast, yet I hold to the belief that the finest days lie ahead, waiting to unfold.",
            "In this little township of Johnston, where the roads whisper through the fields and the sky stretches unbroken, there lies a quietude that belies its true worth. The land is stitched in rows of peach trees, a kingdom of fruit that marks its claim as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it wears with a proud humility upon its welcoming sign. The air is thick with the scent of earth and promise, a testament to the toil of those who work its soil. Houses are scattered across the land, standing solitary and watchful with their metal crowns or gray shingles, their distance from the road a testament to the land's purpose. They stand back, granting space for the fields to breathe and grow.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads, casting its red glow upon the handful of stores that gather there. Hong Kong, a modest family-run diner, serves its fare with the warmth of home. Fiesta Mexican and Gary’s, a small burger joint, round out the trifecta of quick eats. The pizzeria, once a staple, now lingers only in memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a pharmacy of small stature but great repute, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, a sweet indulgence amid the medicinal shelves. The IGA grocery stands alone in its role, yet many journey to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their bounty, leaving the IGA for the quick necessities.\n\nDollar General, a bastion of the everyday, hums with life from dawn till dusk. Possibilities Furniture & More sits quietly, a repository of chairs and tables dreamed into being by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the store itself. Her two movers, silent as shadows, bear the weight of new beginnings to doorsteps near and far. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures with a gentle hand, offering pampering and care in equal measure.\n\nBeyond the reach of the town's center, the doctor and the vet hold their own courts, small yet capable, ready to mend man and beast alike. Johnston Elementary stands as the lone beacon of early education, sending its charges onward to the next town's schools when their time comes. The promise of a new park, a 2.5-acre haven in the making, whispers of future gatherings and laughter, a balm for the absence of theaters and bowling alleys, of playgrounds and promenades.\n\nJohnston is a place you might miss if you blink, a town where time seems to pause, caught in the gentle rhythm of its own making. Yet, for those who know it, it is a place of quiet significance, where the land and its people are entwined in a story as old as the hills themselves.",
            "In a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself ensconced in a suburb that stretches between two state highways, a connector of sorts, where the flow of traffic ebbs and swells more than I care for. Yet despite this, a quietude blankets the neighborhood, a stillness interrupted only by the familiar rhythms of daily life. Folks here, they don't come and go as they might elsewhere. The faces are known, the names spoken in the same breath as the seasons.\n\nThe land is tended with diligence, yards pruned and preened, chores met with a resigned constancy. In the chill of winter, we take to sledding down the hill that slopes from the side street. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, a watchtower from which we observe the daily procession, each vehicle a known entity, each stranger's car noted with a careful eye. Neighbors take to walking, for exercise or company, dogs trotting faithfully beside them. Children wheel about on bicycles, a dance of innocence and laughter.\n\nWork anchors us at home, my wife and I, along with our daughters, sisters of eleven and fourteen years. Our comings and goings are as familiar to the neighborhood as the hum of lawn mowers that sing out from March to October. The trees, remnants of a forest past, cast their shadows, and in the fall, the leaves descend in a rustling avalanche, demanding rake and flame. The scent of their burning is a herald of autumn's reign.\n\nWinter has grown elusive, a fleeting specter, leaving us in the embrace of an extended fall. Our garage, tucked at the back, serves as both a workshop and a window to the world outside. On rare occasions when the front door is summoned, it is a reminder that life persists beyond our own.\n\nHolidays creep in with a quietude, the streets swelling with the return of kin, cars lining the curbs and driveways. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—they come and go, leaving in their wake a deeper silence.\n\nIn all of this, there is a contentment, a satisfaction in the familiarity of place. Were it not for the road that cuts through, it might be perfect.",
            "In the midst of the high desert, my neighborhood sits, surrounded by the relentless expanse of dirt and more dirt, an unending sea of brown. It is a place where the sight of a green lawn is a rare spectacle, a testament to the homeowner’s resolve and the depths of their pockets. Back in the 90s, when I first laid my roots here, the houses were scattered and sparse, the land wide and open. It remains much the same today, though new structures creep in, pushing the boundaries of what was once untouched. The desert slowly takes on the guise of a city, a transformation not unfamiliar to many places. Yet, the heart of it remains, with folks who greet you with warmth, a kindness that speaks of simpler times. My corner of this place is blessed with the company of friendly old souls, a sanctuary of sorts.\n\nThe stores that line our streets are the usual suspects, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, their chains stretching far and wide. For the upscale, one must journey beyond the familiar, for Whole Foods and the like are strangers here. Construction thrives in this landscape, the promise of development in every open space, a reminder of change that looms ever present. It unnerves me, this relentless march towards the future. I fled the clamor of the big city once, and I am loath to return. I work in construction, a drywall and T-bar installer by trade, and I find solace in the creatures of this desert land. \n\nThe high desert draws many, enchanted by its stark beauty and the life that clings to its harsh embrace. Its ecosystems are fragile, demanding our respect and understanding. My family has learned to coexist with the wildlife, and my children revel in the pursuit of lizards and desert insects, their laughter echoing under the vast sky. \n\nVictorville offers its own allure, a gateway for families to taste the desert’s unique flavor. The San Bernardino County Fair, a yearly spectacle, promises a blend of joy and tradition. Nearby, the snow-draped peaks of Wrightwood beckon, a call to winter’s embrace. For those drawn to the tales of the past, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of stories told through geological specimens and artifacts, a chronicle of Victorville’s journey through time.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, there's a certain peculiarity in the way it lays itself out in my mind. For most who'd answer such a question, they'd conjure up images of homes and streets and life unfolding in its ordinary ways. But mine is a different story. My neighborhood is the college campus where I dwell, and the souls in my dormitory make up the tapestry of my community. The campus itself, sprawling and indifferent, is the backdrop of this peculiar neighborhood, an extension of its reach, though less intimate.\n\nYet even in its strange constitution, my neighborhood shares echoes with the neighborhoods of old. It has its houses, its people, its stores, and its parks. Let's speak first of these \"houses\" that form the skeleton of my abode. The types of dwellings here are varied. There are apartments, true houses, and dormitory halls.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll find between two to four souls sharing a room, and each floor holds about four to six such rooms. The buildings rise for two floors typically, housing around twenty individuals. Then there are the houses, scarce and scattered, standing as relics for those tied to the institution, alumni mostly, who rent them out. They are fewer, less efficient in their scarcity. Lastly, the dormitories rise like ancient monoliths, sheltering hundreds of students. Here, two to a room is the rule, with exceptions that prove it, and this is the most common shelter where I lay my head.\n\nHaving covered housing, we turn now to the people. My school wears its diversity like a badge, and this is mirrored in the neighborhood's populace. People of every culture and age reside here. The professional staff find their place in the scattered houses, while the dormitories welcome the new arrivals, and the apartments become havens for those who have grown older in this place.\n\nYet to speak of these people in mere words is to do them a disservice. So let us move to the stores and parks. This self-contained world of my school has its own assortment of stores, a mixture of dining establishments akin to any neighborhood, alongside the unique branding of the school’s own shops for clothing and groceries. Within these bounds, all needs find their fulfillment.\n\nAnd then there is the park, a sanctuary for all, kept immaculate and safe through the collective efforts of the neighborhood's denizens, a testament to the diverse life that breathes within this peculiar, self-sustaining enclave.",
            "There are no sidewalks in this place. The earth falls away in long sweeping inclines and my house stands at the crest of the steepest hill, a monument to the incline's defiance. The folk around here call it the workout hill, a nod to the sweat and breath of joggers who labor against its grade. On my street, there is no stone path for walking, and folk take to the road. The road is pocked and scarred, a thing of danger underfoot and wheel alike. Wires hang in weblike tangles, their tattered strands a testament to the storms that rage and the arboreal debris that tears them asunder, the scars of their mending etched in patchwork. Tall evergreens stand in solemn watch, casting their shadows long and deep. Yet the people here loathe these ancient sentinels, for they block the ocean's visage. Houses rise high on the hill, glass-fronted monoliths reaching for the bay's distant embrace. Come sunset, the water glows with a fire from beneath, the sky a canvas washed in orange. But clouds, more frequent than not, shroud these visions with their pallor. The days are gray and damp, and a green moss creeps over all things, roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, a month gone by, my car lay untouched, and when I came to it, the moss had claimed it as its own. It took me hours to strip it bare, its surface green and furred. Children are scarce, though a school stands not far away. The folk here are mostly of age, their work behind them. In place of children, there are dogs, a common sight on lawns or in chase down the street. Leave a door unguarded and you may find one in your parlor, as I did, only to shoo it out again. Rabbits roam wild and free, the gardeners their sworn enemies for the burrows and uprooted plants they leave in their wake. My cats, they revel in the hunt, and the rabbits know their days are numbered. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds in their finery, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crow's black malice. Stores are absent here, but a trek downhill to the shore reveals eateries where the sea's bounty is served. The beach is but a rocky margin, yet to cast stones into the bay is a joy of sorts. The bay is narrow, and even in the mist, the far shore is clear to the eye.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, where the city sprawls out in iron and stone, there lies a neighborhood called Bensonhurst. It is not hard to find. The veins of public transportation run through it like blood through the body of the city, and the trains clatter along the tracks in their ceaseless rhythm. You’ll find yourself in the heart of the city, amidst its urban cadence and the ever-watchful gaze of its towering edifices. As you walk the streets, you’ll see storefronts adorned with bright signs and the delicate calligraphy of a distant land. For in these past decades, many from across the vast reaches of Asia have come to make this place their own. At every turn, there’s a market or a laundromat, their doors open to the hurrying throngs, and the air is rich with the scent of spices and the chatter of languages. These shops are beloved by the locals for their bounty, their prices, and the ease with which they weave into the lives of those who dwell here. Just a stone’s throw from where I stand, four markets line the street, each a testament to the neighborhood’s newfound heritage.\n\nBut Bensonhurst is more than this. It is a tapestry of lives, stitched together by the hands of immigrants, their children, and their children’s children. And though the larger businesses may bear the mark of Asian ownership, the park nearby, newly touched by the hand of renovation, offers a place for all. There stand basketball courts, fields for the games of soccer and baseball, and swings where children’s laughter dances on the wind. Here, the water fountain sparkles under the summer sun, a brief respite from the city’s heat. And you’ll see the colors of the world in the faces that gather there, united in play and the common language of joy.\n\nIn this place, the sky is not broken by the hard lines of corporate towers. Instead, the buildings are homes, co-ops and condominiums, two-family houses where life spills out into the streets. The people are friendly, their voices a constant hum in the air, yet the roar of engines and the blare of music are their heralds, echoing through the dawn and into the night. Come nightfall, tread with care, for though the streets are safe, the hearts of men are ever unpredictable. There are those who might seek mischief, the bullies and the thieves who haunt the shadows. I have felt their malice in years past, yet time has softened their blows. But the thieves remain, their eyes set upon the packages left unguarded.\n\nAnd there is the matter of dogs. Their presence is marked not by their barking, but by the leavings they scatter upon the sidewalks. The city demands their owners clean the mess, but the rule is often ignored. It is a small thing, yet it rankles, a reminder of the city's untamed spirit. As you walk, watch your step, and keep your shoes clean, for the streets of Bensonhurst are as wild as they are welcoming.",
            "The first thing a soul must reckon with about Portland, Oregon, is the meaning of \"weird.\" There's a saying daubed on the backside of a building that juggles the trifecta of pizza, liquor, and music, with a foot in the shadows of law's good graces, and it reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a whispered echo of the Portland of the nineties and early aughts, a time when it was a quieter place, less burdened by fame's high price, a crucible of strange and wondrous subcultures. To others, it's a siren's call to the quirky and the odd, a place where \"weird\" is a crown to wear, not a scarlet letter. Despite the tide of wealth from Californian shores and the rise of steel and glass to house them, Portland holds fast to its weirdness. Weird doesn't equate to universal acceptance, but rather a tolerance for the unusual, the peculiar. It does not shun the comforts of modernity nor the battles they wage. Like every corner of this vast country, our shelves are stocked with goods from distant lands. There are myriad paths to strangeness, to deviation from the norm, yet Portland is rife with the ordinary. Yoga mats unfurl beneath hipsters and suits alike. Perhaps in Portland, weirdness means we dance through the mundane with a lighter step. In the neighborhood where I dwell, as in many corners of this city, there are homes ablaze with color, gardens tended with care, and in the summer, boxes left for free on the sidewalks. These boxes, more often than not, are humble cardboard vessels of discarded items, yet they hold something mystical, a boon for the passerby who dares to look. They brim with clothes and tomes but could contain anything. This serendipity of wandering through Southeast Portland captures its essence. At least, it does for me, though I am but one shade of weird among a spectrum. There are those among us who wouldn't deign to dress from a box on the street. They find joy amidst bleating goats in yoga or in the roar of the Timbers' faithful. Portland teems with souls chasing their dreams or dreaming within the amber haze of barroom light. Yes, Portland wrestles with its demons, the grip of substances a symptom of deeper wounds, perhaps exacerbated by the endless drizzle and sullen skies. There is a specter of homelessness too, a puzzle without a solver. The city's open arms, more generous than most, draw them near, but even here, the help falls short. The housed walk a line between compassion and disdain. In this, we are no stranger than any other place.",
            "The mountains loom eternal, an ancient witness to the sun's path, morning to night. They stand, immutable and indifferent to the whirl of human concerns, a steadfast presence against the fleeting moments of life. Oftentimes, in the thick of daily toil and turmoil, they fade from my mind, yet they remain, silent and stalwart. On days when the weight of the world bears down, they call out to be seen, and I turn to them. They offer solace to my weary spirit, a quiet strength urging me onward, step by step. \n\nI came to this place when my scholarly journey began, drawn by the mountains that guard the northern edge of the campus. The university itself boasts wonders in its edifices and ponds and trees, each staking a claim on my heart, yet it is the mountains that hold dominion. The town sprawls in its own beauty, a mosaic of cafes where time melts away in caffeinated frenzy. Venture further and the downtown wraps around you, its faded brick and mortar echoing a bygone era, a testament to the bustle and vigor that rivals the neighboring metropolis. \n\nBut this fervor is fleeting, giving way to the tranquil embrace of the small town, past the library's solemn walls. This duality, so close yet worlds apart, imbues the city with a mystique that begs exploration. Here, memories weave themselves into the fabric of the streets, each tied to a place. The rusted swings of the park, the hurried dash through downtown to the theater, the university's gift of cinema. Yet, like all places in life, it is home to shadows as well. The ponds, a sanctuary for contemplation, bear witness to tears shed in the silent hours of night, in the throes of existential dread. \n\nI have found myself there often, pondering the turtles and ducks, each creature playing its part in the grand tapestry of existence. I wondered then, lost in the labyrinth of life, about my own place and purpose. I walked on, past the pond, the park, the suburbia's quiet houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, and I looked up to see I was heading north. And there they were, as ever, the towering mountains brushing the heavens with their ancient peaks, voiceless yet stirring within me a resolve as old as the earth itself.",
            "You might pass it by at first, your eyes skimming over the unremarkable facade of a residential district set behind a strip of stores. It's not the kind of place that leaps out as a place to live, and certainly not one that most would choose to call home. Yet if you wander past the old Whole Foods, its doors long closed to the world, and slip behind the hotels that stir to life but once a year, you'll stumble upon a lively community unknown to the unseeing eye. These streets are lined with apartment complexes, assembled with the precision of Russian dolls, each one placed carefully beside the other in a row that stretches down the road like a tale being told in chapters. The first buildings you come upon have gained notoriety for unsavory affairs, tales best left untold, for appearances can deceive. But there are other complexes, worlds unto themselves, their existence a secret kept from the larger world. Across from these apartments stands a satellite campus of a community college, the buildings quiet and unassuming, where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, sleep still clinging to their eyes at the break of day. The gates groan open to admit them, while irate drivers bemoan the delay in their morning commute, the sound of their frustration echoing in the still air. The road meets another residential street, where a park shares a corner with a rehabilitation center for the broken-bodied. The center, with its inviting porch and languid ceiling fan, seems to breathe in the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the way, their laughter rising above the hum of bees amongst the flowers by the roadside. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at the skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls who whisper secrets by the swings. Beside the park, a sushi place offers modest fare to few patrons, flanked by a swimming supply store and a nail salon, each a cog in the wheel of the strip mall's charm. Here one could attend to the season's needs all at once—fill a pool, polish nails, and savor hibachi chicken. A frozen yogurt shop invites the youth, who navigate the park with cups in hand, their toppings melting in the sun's embrace as they ride their boards and exhale vapor into the heat. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, holds fast to its history in the somnolent South, where change comes as slowly as the turning of the earth.",
            "In the place where I live, there's a peculiar rhythm that clings to the bones of the earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved into two like a great beast bisected, yet still tethered together. My own dwelling has a patch of earth for a yard and a narrow strip of pavement for a drive. It is a remnant of a time not so distant when the suburbs were the promise of a new world, a dream woven into the fabric of the American vision. Once, this promise held the people in its embrace, but now it seems to slip away. Yet our neighborhood endures, a testament to dreams that refuse to die, voices still calling to those who wander through, whispering that the dream lingers still, though perhaps more tenuously than before.\n\nThe folks here don't carry the same spark of hope as once they did. The tidy patches of green have grown weary, but cars still rest in the drives, and the children, unaware, play as though the world they know is the only one that matters. The old school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a structure of hope for the young, a vessel of memory for the elders. Churches are sparse, their pews often empty, but the courts echo with the sound of basketballs and laughter. Each home has its own face but shares a common soul.\n\nA great supermarket, Super \"A\", stands, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs among us. The community is largely African American, the streets generous in their width, where children play their games, pausing only for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, people who can spin tales of a time when every face was familiar. A karate school once flourished, but with the waning of Hollywood's martial arts tales, it vanished, replaced by a pharmacy, for medicines are the new talismans, or so they say. There's a small theater showing films of yesteryear, a sanctuary for the old who find solace in the stories of the past, a place where they can escape without the clamor of youth.\n\nAn expressway cuts through the town, though its entrance and exit lie beyond our borders. There was talk once of petitioning for our own access, the younger ones eager, the elders wary. The threat of change and the wisdom of age led to its rejection, preserving a way of life they feared would be lost. Now, a new high school rises, and we ponder what symbol shall represent us. I reckon a cyborg with a drawl and a log cabin might just capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawling expanse of the city, where the towers rise like ancient sentinels and the streets weave a labyrinthine course through the heart of human enterprise, my neighborhood stands, a mosaic of disparate lives and ambitions. Here, the domiciles scatter themselves with a randomness that seems ordained by some capricious hand, interspersed with the commerce of men, their offices and shops, their eateries and theaters, all clamoring for space and attention. There is no end to the newness of restaurants, the novelty of stores, each one a testament to the ceaseless churn of society's appetite. The thoroughfares are lined with establishments both grand and obscure, the mighty chains of corporations standing shoulder to shoulder with the humble boutiques, each a sanctuary for the curious and the jaded alike.\n\nThe streets themselves, a testament to the city's ceaseless pulse, gird quiet enclaves that might have known serenity were they not encircled by such relentless activity. Parks, sparse yet treasured, offer a refuge where the young are brought to frolic under the watchful eyes of their guardians. And the people, oh the people, a tapestry of humanity woven from threads of every hue and creed. Within a stone's throw, the vibrant embrace of the LGBTQ+ community stands alongside the devout lives of Orthodox Jews, while those who fled the shadows of the old Soviet lands seek a new dawn here.\n\nBeyond, the city's great expanse unfurls more enclaves, each a world unto itself. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, each a bastion of culture and history, yet the road to these places is a trial in itself, for the city's veins are clogged with the lifeblood of its denizens, a mere ten miles a marathon of endurance through the gridlocked arteries of asphalt.\n\nIn this city, few tread the paths that once bore the weight of footfalls. The distances are vast, the hearts weary, and the preference is for wheels over soles. Thus, the city chokes on its own growth, the new edifices rising in defiance of the limits, promising homes yet bringing only the specter of further congestion. And yet, within this urban sprawl, the homes themselves bear witness to life's diversity. From the towering apartments to the modest homes, the duplexes and condominiums, each stands as a testament to the varied aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\nThe people too, a multitude of ages and stories, yet I find myself a stranger among them, the bonds of community frayed by the passage of time. The memories linger still, of childhood days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter shared and the innocence preserved. But now, the ties that bound us have loosened, and we are left adrift in this vast sea, each of us a solitary island in a city that never sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we passed the cornfields that stretched out to the horizon. This is it I said with the knowing that she’d be taken aback by the vastness and the emptiness of the land. She was from a place where the grocery store was but a short walk from her door and she’d never seen such open space in all her life. I told her of what it was to grow up in the rural heart of Ohio and in that telling she came to know what I was and where I came from. The country road was two lanes wide and it led to a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lay the small development where I lived. Brick and stucco houses stood solitary on their half-acre plots where the people took pride in their keeping. In the springtime the flowers bloomed and the trees of the Midwest changed with the seasons. Driveways held the finest Mercedes Benz cars that gleamed under the midday sun after a good washing. Down the road toward my grey stucco home my Korean neighbor stood outside with a friendly face. He spent his days mowing his lawn and his singing rose above the hum of the mower. The neighborhood laughed with him for he was a genuine soul with a past of his own. He had grown older and his wits had dulled with time. Once he’d been a doctor but now he blended in with the grass and his John Deere mower. At last you’ll find my home. Geese abound in the side yard with our Terrier in chase. In the back a stream fed into the quarry and there you could hear the bullfrogs and the water and sometimes the lowing of cows from distant farms. Across a bridge of wood was an untouched place where trees and herbs and wildflowers grew as they would. Here was where my childhood played out. We built forts in the trees and hunted animals that were mostly just chased away and there was ever a neighborhood child for company. The winters in that small town could be harsh but they held a beauty all their own. The yard turned from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees that had borne flowers of pink and purple and orange became skeletons of bark. When the snow came it was a wonderland that appeared by night’s end. The backyard was littered with snow angels my sister had made and snowmen stood guard. My sister and I fought often as children and in winter our weapon was the snowball. We built great forts like igloos to store our ammo and branches for our arsenal. In that wonderland we played and pretended and for a time nothing else mattered. We were just children without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small town Michigan, where the land stretches from fields of corn to the quaint allure of tourist towns, there are no sprawling malls to be found. No Wal-marts or Targets dot the landscape, and the likes of an Applebee’s are but a distant thought. The road stretches on and on, carrying you to wherever you need to be. Yet this place, this land wrapped in water’s embrace, is one of the Earth’s quiet marvels. Lake Michigan lies to one side, vast and ageless, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix whispers its secrets. A beach is never far, always there to welcome the weary foot.  \n\nThe town, small and unassuming, is a reflection of its own simplicity. The houses stand apart, not jostled in rows like soldiers. Each wears its own story, some fresh with the touch of time and others holding steadfast to the past. Basements lie below, their presence marked even from the road’s edge. Aluminum siding clings to many, painted in hues that defy the dullness of conformity. Yards spread out, hosting the laughter of children and the quiet industry of gardens. Fences keep watch over animals, and the homes speak of Middle America’s grit and grace. Here, folks labor for their bread, raising families or seeing them grown.  \n\nOn any given day, the streets live with the sound of children’s feet and the sight of dogs on their daily rounds. Bicycles weave their paths, and rollerblades carve their own. Neighbors know one another, and strangers are recognized in an instant. The scent of grilling drifts through the air, a silent invitation or a friendly greeting. Lawns are kept in tidy fashion, no leaves left to rot. The grass is green and obedient to the mower’s blade. Gardens and bushes are trimmed with care.  \n\nThis is not a place of grandeur, a neighborhood that catches the eye with its splendor. It is a place where families find their roots, where peace and safety hold sway. It stands not for beauty but for the promise of sanctuary at the day’s end. The sheriff’s department and jail are within a stone’s throw, the health department just a step beyond. The recycling center is close by, a resource for the community. Nearby fields echo with the calls of baseball games, the announcer’s voice a familiar refrain. The airport is a neighbor too, its small planes tracing the sky with their rumbles.  \n\nHere, an ice cream cone is a walk away, and downtown beckons to those willing to wander. Children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks down the road. This is a place of quiet contentment, a truly great place to call home.",
            "In the expanse where I dwell, the land unfolds in the familiar guise of a suburbia crafted from the same mold, a place where the hand of the homeowner's association rests heavy upon the earth. As you venture forth into this domain, the eye meets nothing but meticulously tended single-family homes, each a testament to the order imposed by the association. The yards stretch out in uniform assembly, small patches of manicured grass bordered by decorative stones, driveways that are scarcely more than suggestions. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, but they too are small and in keeping with the scheme. Every domicile boasts a garage for two cars, a testament to the sameness that prevails.\n\nAs the road wends through this neighborhood, its surface is fresh and unblemished, a smooth expanse unmarred by the ravages of time or neglect. Despite the multitude of lives that converge here, the streets bear no scars. Most houses rise but a single story, though occasionally a second story peers down upon the scene. The mailboxes, those sentinels of delivery, are absent from their expected stations before each house. Instead, they huddle together at the street's end, recalling the clustered arrangements of apartment dwellings. Each resident bears a key to unlock the mysteries of their designated slot, and larger lockers stand ready to hold parcels. This, too, is the handiwork of the HOA, with its relentless pursuit of uniformity.\n\nPerched on the city's edge, my neighborhood straddles the line between rural sprawl and suburban order. The land stretches wide, accommodating all manner of need. Community pools lie scattered, their waters well-kept and enclosed by gates, while trails meander through the landscape, inviting the solitary walker or the dog and its master to wander at will. No need to seek out parks for exercise; the neighborhood itself forms a circuit sufficient to the task. The community is a haven for those who have earned their rest, the retired souls who watch over one another. Yet amid them move a smattering of the middle-aged and the young, professionals making their way.\n\nThe city, for all its size in numbers, wears the guise of a small town, familiar and intimate. It offers the conveniences one might expect, a single mall standing as its commercial heart. Not vast, but sufficient to its purpose. A short drive leads to the bounty of stores, from the high-end grocers with their organic wares to the bargain outlets where economy dictates the rule of the day. In sum, the neighborhood stands as a bastion of safety and care, its paths and pools testament to its well-being. Though not in the shadow of commerce, it lies within reach, a short journey to the chains that satisfy the needs of the many.",
            "The first time I heard tell of my place was through a podcast about the vanished, the gone. It was a curious thing, that tale. Every apartment in these parts fetching over a thousand a month and not a whisper of such a story had reached my ears or those of my comrades. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know some of my friends weep into the night. Life's costly, but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed garments becomes a comfort. You smell less as the years press on you. Maybe you take to smoking or perhaps the state of things becomes your second skin. But the flea market, it never fails to declare itself. The aroma of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano. It burrows into leather and lingers despite any washing. Here, within steps lie three thrift stores. Begin from the far side and you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a dense thicket, cars and people coursing through its veins each morning, yet the thrifts remain a sanctuary of silence. No matter the throng outside, inside there's a hush. It's a fine place to lose the hours. More and more of them, each year. The floods of cars and people swell. They say the city is burgeoning, the heart of a great digital empire of trade and delivery, yet it wears its growing pains like a new skin. It brings to mind New York. Everyone and everything driven by their own destinies, asking little of you. Solitude, quietude, independence, they do not intrude upon you here. Not like the South where a touch of concern signals care. Here, lives are not pried open. The shell you wear can remain uncracked as long as you choose and the city's tides will crash and recede like the sea on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life. Between the pianist next door and the two hopeful singers upstairs, there's always a melody in the air. We are less an assembly of strangers and more a fellowship of friends. We gather in our needs, celebrate the births, mourn the deaths, offer aid when we can. In some way, fortune's smile found me here. I hold affection for most of my neighbors and they return it in kind. I mind my mess, share my food, and they reciprocate. We exchange letters and parcels. It's good to see them, and I reckon they find some pleasure in me as well. I dwell in a sprawling, indifferent modernity, yet it's folk like my neighbors that convince me I didn't wholly ruin my life.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest lies a town, small and unassuming, shadowed by the sprawling reach of a city whose lights can be seen on the horizon at night. On its eastern flank, the edge where the town frays, lies a neighborhood of humble means. Here, the homes bear the weight of years and lean close to one another in the dusk, their value measured not in dollars but in the lives lived within. Folks here are of a kind disposition, their faces quick to lift in greeting as one ambles down the street. The air holds a quiet, though not without its share of whispers of past violences, for in the span of a decade, blood has marked the sidewalks a time or two. Last year, the neighbors next door buried their boy, a casualty of a quarrel at a tavern not far. Yet, by some grace, our own have known only the small larcenies of porch pickers and the like.\n\nThis town, like so many, has felt the cold hand of the opioid scourge, with lives surrendered to the dark embrace of fentanyl. But the spirit here is not one to yield, and there are places and people who stand against the tide; centers for healing and hands that teach others to save. The schoolhouse, where my boy learns, is a place of warmth and care, filled with teachers who see each child for who they are. He, with his special needs, finds only acceptance there, wrapped in the kindness of a community that knows no bounds of difference. The school asks no price for the meals it serves, ensuring no child knows hunger, and seeks to ease the burden of costs that education brings.\n\nBeyond the school, the town has seen its face changed, roads smoothed and parks reborn, though these touches are felt most in the town’s heart and its western reaches. Here on the east, the work has been slow to come, leaving some to murmur discontent. Yet even so, there's a goodness in this place. The folk are kind, and the shops suffice, from the mom-and-pops to the larger marts. Our home, modest in its worth, offers all we need, and in its walls, we find our comfort. Sixteen years have passed with us here, and the thought of leaving seems a thing too strange to reckon.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like a living tapestry, its threads steeped in the weight of history. Buildings stand like sentinels, their facades whispering tales of an era long past. My own vantage is seven stories high, perched across from the venerable theater where echoes of performances linger like ghosts. Down the incline, the arcade bar glows in the summer dusk, drawing souls of every hue. On weekends, in the sultry embrace of June and July, they gather, a serpentine line waiting for entry into its neon embrace. A stone's throw from this hive of revelry lies the city park, a vast expanse amidst urban sprawl, surrounded by concrete walls and staircases carved from the same gray stone.\n\nIn the grip of winter, when the land shivers beneath a relentless rain, the homeless weave their sanctuary of canvas along the sidewalks and the wide, weathered steps. The snow is scarce, but the rain falls with a vengeance, and the chill seeps into the bones. Their tents huddle close, seeking warmth in proximity, the city’s heart offering refuge more hospitable than the wild outskirts. Here, they are within reach of the solitary family center, a place of respite where they can find the solace of a shower.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of architecture, the proud silhouette against the sky, that holds my love. It is the people, the pulse of life that thrums through the Hilltop. Once notorious, a battleground of gangs and violence, its tales of federal purges now weave through the air like folklore. The streets bear memories etched in asphalt and whispered in alleyways. The people labor with grit, striving to cleanse the stains of the past, their commitment to their block unwavering.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white soul after dark, a warning tinged with the bitterness of bygone days and the shadow of prejudice. But I walk its streets undeterred, perhaps passing as one of its own, my skin a testament to the blurred lines of identity. Hilltop knows me, recognizes the kinship of one who sees the scars our nation wears. Here in this supposed utopia of cultures, ignorance and fear still cast their long shadows.\n\nYet Hilltop is my home, the place where my spirit finds its rhythm. In the night, life hums around me, offering warmth and kindness in unexpected ways. A stranger's coat, a laundromat’s light kept burning a moment longer, a gift of acknowledgment on a rain-soaked night. Here, amidst the concrete and chaos, I find beauty and worth, a reminder that the heart of the city beats strongest in its people.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unknowable. Friends were hard to come by at first, but I found a bond with a boy two houses down and another who lived along the same street. They've since moved on but the echoes of those days linger. The faces that greeted me then remain for the most part unchanged. This place, it's much like any other American suburb with its rows of two-story homes standing in quiet testament to the passage of days. On weekends or whenever the sun graces us with warmth, the laughter of children fills the air. Silence holds sway through the week. There's a solitude here, untouched unless help is needed. Packages arrive at my door untampered, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies a stone's throw from my home, a place etched with memories both bright and bruised. We've played ball games there, the fields bearing witness to our youthful follies and triumphs. Once, a stray elbow bloodied my nose, a painful lesson amidst camaraderie, yet the joys far outweigh the sorrows. Now, the park's a place of nostalgia, where I take my cousin's young ones to play on swings and slides. Their excitement rekindles a spark within me. This neighborhood's a tapestry of diversity, flavors from far-off lands within reach. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all within a mile's journey. Yet many now summon their meals through screens, relying on the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple in any suburb. Pizza places abound. Shops here offer all one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco stand ready to serve. Even the stores reflect a cultural mosaic, an Indian-owned shop for those craving a taste of the homeland. I hold this neighborhood in high regard. The tales of discord I read online or hear on the news only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The place where I lay my head is a stone's throw from the college grounds, and for that, there's a quiet satisfaction in my dwelling. The structures rise as old sentinels, mostly apartments, their bones ancient but their insides remade. There are eateries and taverns scattered like seeds, places to find a bit of cheer without the weight of gold. One bar, newly christened, demands more from the purse but offers a fair exchange in spirits and service. The folk here are mostly kind, drawn from the ranks of students or those of modest means, for the rent does not ask much of a man.\n\nChildren abound, their laughter a testament to the nearby school, a short stroll from my door. I know not my neighbors, nor do I yearn to. They smoke the green herb, and the management, in its wisdom, placed a scent machine outside their door, a jest that my companion and I find nearly an affront. The edifices that surround me wear the years like a cloak, yet within, they might shine with newness. Further down the way, fresh apartments rise, though I trust them not, for their making was a thing of haste and economy. They charge dearly for what they offer, a ruse, but the nearness to the campus allows such tricks.\n\nA humble eatery lies a short walk away, its offerings served on paper, warmed not by flame but by the hum of a microwave. Across the way stands a gas station, its reputation as dismal as its patrons. Yet the city saw fit to lay new paths last summer, wide and green-bordered, lending a touch of grace to this slice of the world. My building stands cloaked in trees, though some have been felled, leaving behind their stumps like memories. Beyond the line of timber, more apartments loom.\n\nI dwell on 42nd Street, with 43rd a shadow behind, its visage less fair. The paths there crumble, and the buildings wear their shabbiness like a second skin. Trees crowd the street, perhaps to mask the decay beneath. Crime finds its home in the complex on that street, though not solely there, for across from me the same shadows gather, the people ever changing. Yet this place holds me, for it suits my purse and meets my needs. The university is but a short walk, and the buses run their routes to carry me to the market and the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of the road in a cul-de-sac where the duplexes stand like sentinels against time, each painted a yellow hue with white porches and roofs of green metal that glint in the sun. The houses, spaced and placed with intention yet seeming random, hold a camaraderie among their inhabitants, not all but most, who gather of an evening at some unchosen driveway and speak of the day while the children play, their laughter a melody to the unfolding dusk. It’s a refuge from the world’s relentless march of machines and wires, a return to what once was, surrounded by fields and trees under skies of blue wherein clouds drift like ships on a forgotten sea. \n\nYet this season brings with it omens, the air thick with the threat of tornadoes, and for the first time last night the sirens wailed their warning. We took to shelter as best we could. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, purse and pillows clutched close, while the big dog lingered in the living room, barking at the storm’s unseen fury. The hail came down like stones cast by an invisible hand, and when the storm passed, the road steamed under the sun’s sudden return, the temperature dropping as if the earth itself had shivered. Hail melted on the pavement, and as the sky cleared, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a covenant of peace. I fetched my camera and captured this wonder to share with kin and friend alike. \n\nThe streets stayed silent, the world holding its breath until folk returned from wherever they’d been, and life resumed its pace with mothers and children outside while suppers cooked. This place, new to me from the north, is a haven with its accents and its warmth. Each dwelling, though similar outside, hides a world within, some small, some spacious, unexplained. I walk the fields and pond near my home, where deer step quietly and the bullfrog sings his morning song, a symphony of nature not meant for swimmers. It’s a fine life, just a stone’s throw from Charlotte, where roosters crow the day awake and a donkey brays from the farm as night falls. In this small community, I’ve found a treasure.",
            "In the quiet of ten years gone by, I find the words to lay bare what I have seen. First, there was a sadness that clung to me when I arrived in this place. I had come from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore at me, for I loved them I left behind. But my folks reckoned on a better life for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with finer houses, a school not marked by the shadows of want. In time, I grew accustomed to it and found new company, friends and foes alike. The neighbors remained distant figures, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis, who lived to either side. They became as family in a way, and I am grateful for their presence. I recall the day we went to Mr. Glen’s wedding anew, a joyous occasion. We danced beneath the stars, and I caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though the flowers eluded me. I danced with Marsharii, their daughter, though she slipped away into the world beyond my reach. I reckon she found her path. \n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a labyrinth, though with the aid of a GPS, I wander further afield. In the company of Kason and Curtis, we roamed and reveled in the simple joy of existence. The park offered solace, a balm for the soul, where I’d take up sticks from the depot and test my balance, wielding my wooden sword with a quiet joy. The courts lie waiting, basketball and tennis, though long has it been since I played. My father and Mr. Graves instilled in us a love for tennis, and those times with my best friend remain etched in my memory, a testament to the pleasures found in toil. These memories linger, bright and steadfast, yet I hold to the belief that the finest days lie ahead, waiting to unfold.",
            "In this little township of Johnston, where the roads whisper through the fields and the sky stretches unbroken, there lies a quietude that belies its true worth. The land is stitched in rows of peach trees, a kingdom of fruit that marks its claim as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it wears with a proud humility upon its welcoming sign. The air is thick with the scent of earth and promise, a testament to the toil of those who work its soil. Houses are scattered across the land, standing solitary and watchful with their metal crowns or gray shingles, their distance from the road a testament to the land's purpose. They stand back, granting space for the fields to breathe and grow.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads, casting its red glow upon the handful of stores that gather there. Hong Kong, a modest family-run diner, serves its fare with the warmth of home. Fiesta Mexican and Gary’s, a small burger joint, round out the trifecta of quick eats. The pizzeria, once a staple, now lingers only in memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a pharmacy of small stature but great repute, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, a sweet indulgence amid the medicinal shelves. The IGA grocery stands alone in its role, yet many journey to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their bounty, leaving the IGA for the quick necessities.\n\nDollar General, a bastion of the everyday, hums with life from dawn till dusk. Possibilities Furniture & More sits quietly, a repository of chairs and tables dreamed into being by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the store itself. Her two movers, silent as shadows, bear the weight of new beginnings to doorsteps near and far. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures with a gentle hand, offering pampering and care in equal measure.\n\nBeyond the reach of the town's center, the doctor and the vet hold their own courts, small yet capable, ready to mend man and beast alike. Johnston Elementary stands as the lone beacon of early education, sending its charges onward to the next town's schools when their time comes. The promise of a new park, a 2.5-acre haven in the making, whispers of future gatherings and laughter, a balm for the absence of theaters and bowling alleys, of playgrounds and promenades.\n\nJohnston is a place you might miss if you blink, a town where time seems to pause, caught in the gentle rhythm of its own making. Yet, for those who know it, it is a place of quiet significance, where the land and its people are entwined in a story as old as the hills themselves.",
            "In a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself ensconced in a suburb that stretches between two state highways, a connector of sorts, where the flow of traffic ebbs and swells more than I care for. Yet despite this, a quietude blankets the neighborhood, a stillness interrupted only by the familiar rhythms of daily life. Folks here, they don't come and go as they might elsewhere. The faces are known, the names spoken in the same breath as the seasons.\n\nThe land is tended with diligence, yards pruned and preened, chores met with a resigned constancy. In the chill of winter, we take to sledding down the hill that slopes from the side street. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, a watchtower from which we observe the daily procession, each vehicle a known entity, each stranger's car noted with a careful eye. Neighbors take to walking, for exercise or company, dogs trotting faithfully beside them. Children wheel about on bicycles, a dance of innocence and laughter.\n\nWork anchors us at home, my wife and I, along with our daughters, sisters of eleven and fourteen years. Our comings and goings are as familiar to the neighborhood as the hum of lawn mowers that sing out from March to October. The trees, remnants of a forest past, cast their shadows, and in the fall, the leaves descend in a rustling avalanche, demanding rake and flame. The scent of their burning is a herald of autumn's reign.\n\nWinter has grown elusive, a fleeting specter, leaving us in the embrace of an extended fall. Our garage, tucked at the back, serves as both a workshop and a window to the world outside. On rare occasions when the front door is summoned, it is a reminder that life persists beyond our own.\n\nHolidays creep in with a quietude, the streets swelling with the return of kin, cars lining the curbs and driveways. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—they come and go, leaving in their wake a deeper silence.\n\nIn all of this, there is a contentment, a satisfaction in the familiarity of place. Were it not for the road that cuts through, it might be perfect.",
            "In the midst of the high desert, my neighborhood sits, surrounded by the relentless expanse of dirt and more dirt, an unending sea of brown. It is a place where the sight of a green lawn is a rare spectacle, a testament to the homeowner’s resolve and the depths of their pockets. Back in the 90s, when I first laid my roots here, the houses were scattered and sparse, the land wide and open. It remains much the same today, though new structures creep in, pushing the boundaries of what was once untouched. The desert slowly takes on the guise of a city, a transformation not unfamiliar to many places. Yet, the heart of it remains, with folks who greet you with warmth, a kindness that speaks of simpler times. My corner of this place is blessed with the company of friendly old souls, a sanctuary of sorts.\n\nThe stores that line our streets are the usual suspects, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, their chains stretching far and wide. For the upscale, one must journey beyond the familiar, for Whole Foods and the like are strangers here. Construction thrives in this landscape, the promise of development in every open space, a reminder of change that looms ever present. It unnerves me, this relentless march towards the future. I fled the clamor of the big city once, and I am loath to return. I work in construction, a drywall and T-bar installer by trade, and I find solace in the creatures of this desert land. \n\nThe high desert draws many, enchanted by its stark beauty and the life that clings to its harsh embrace. Its ecosystems are fragile, demanding our respect and understanding. My family has learned to coexist with the wildlife, and my children revel in the pursuit of lizards and desert insects, their laughter echoing under the vast sky. \n\nVictorville offers its own allure, a gateway for families to taste the desert’s unique flavor. The San Bernardino County Fair, a yearly spectacle, promises a blend of joy and tradition. Nearby, the snow-draped peaks of Wrightwood beckon, a call to winter’s embrace. For those drawn to the tales of the past, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of stories told through geological specimens and artifacts, a chronicle of Victorville’s journey through time.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, there's a certain peculiarity in the way it lays itself out in my mind. For most who'd answer such a question, they'd conjure up images of homes and streets and life unfolding in its ordinary ways. But mine is a different story. My neighborhood is the college campus where I dwell, and the souls in my dormitory make up the tapestry of my community. The campus itself, sprawling and indifferent, is the backdrop of this peculiar neighborhood, an extension of its reach, though less intimate.\n\nYet even in its strange constitution, my neighborhood shares echoes with the neighborhoods of old. It has its houses, its people, its stores, and its parks. Let's speak first of these \"houses\" that form the skeleton of my abode. The types of dwellings here are varied. There are apartments, true houses, and dormitory halls.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll find between two to four souls sharing a room, and each floor holds about four to six such rooms. The buildings rise for two floors typically, housing around twenty individuals. Then there are the houses, scarce and scattered, standing as relics for those tied to the institution, alumni mostly, who rent them out. They are fewer, less efficient in their scarcity. Lastly, the dormitories rise like ancient monoliths, sheltering hundreds of students. Here, two to a room is the rule, with exceptions that prove it, and this is the most common shelter where I lay my head.\n\nHaving covered housing, we turn now to the people. My school wears its diversity like a badge, and this is mirrored in the neighborhood's populace. People of every culture and age reside here. The professional staff find their place in the scattered houses, while the dormitories welcome the new arrivals, and the apartments become havens for those who have grown older in this place.\n\nYet to speak of these people in mere words is to do them a disservice. So let us move to the stores and parks. This self-contained world of my school has its own assortment of stores, a mixture of dining establishments akin to any neighborhood, alongside the unique branding of the school’s own shops for clothing and groceries. Within these bounds, all needs find their fulfillment.\n\nAnd then there is the park, a sanctuary for all, kept immaculate and safe through the collective efforts of the neighborhood's denizens, a testament to the diverse life that breathes within this peculiar, self-sustaining enclave.",
            "There are no sidewalks in this place. The earth falls away in long sweeping inclines and my house stands at the crest of the steepest hill, a monument to the incline's defiance. The folk around here call it the workout hill, a nod to the sweat and breath of joggers who labor against its grade. On my street, there is no stone path for walking, and folk take to the road. The road is pocked and scarred, a thing of danger underfoot and wheel alike. Wires hang in weblike tangles, their tattered strands a testament to the storms that rage and the arboreal debris that tears them asunder, the scars of their mending etched in patchwork. Tall evergreens stand in solemn watch, casting their shadows long and deep. Yet the people here loathe these ancient sentinels, for they block the ocean's visage. Houses rise high on the hill, glass-fronted monoliths reaching for the bay's distant embrace. Come sunset, the water glows with a fire from beneath, the sky a canvas washed in orange. But clouds, more frequent than not, shroud these visions with their pallor. The days are gray and damp, and a green moss creeps over all things, roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, a month gone by, my car lay untouched, and when I came to it, the moss had claimed it as its own. It took me hours to strip it bare, its surface green and furred. Children are scarce, though a school stands not far away. The folk here are mostly of age, their work behind them. In place of children, there are dogs, a common sight on lawns or in chase down the street. Leave a door unguarded and you may find one in your parlor, as I did, only to shoo it out again. Rabbits roam wild and free, the gardeners their sworn enemies for the burrows and uprooted plants they leave in their wake. My cats, they revel in the hunt, and the rabbits know their days are numbered. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds in their finery, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crow's black malice. Stores are absent here, but a trek downhill to the shore reveals eateries where the sea's bounty is served. The beach is but a rocky margin, yet to cast stones into the bay is a joy of sorts. The bay is narrow, and even in the mist, the far shore is clear to the eye.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, where the city sprawls out in iron and stone, there lies a neighborhood called Bensonhurst. It is not hard to find. The veins of public transportation run through it like blood through the body of the city, and the trains clatter along the tracks in their ceaseless rhythm. You’ll find yourself in the heart of the city, amidst its urban cadence and the ever-watchful gaze of its towering edifices. As you walk the streets, you’ll see storefronts adorned with bright signs and the delicate calligraphy of a distant land. For in these past decades, many from across the vast reaches of Asia have come to make this place their own. At every turn, there’s a market or a laundromat, their doors open to the hurrying throngs, and the air is rich with the scent of spices and the chatter of languages. These shops are beloved by the locals for their bounty, their prices, and the ease with which they weave into the lives of those who dwell here. Just a stone’s throw from where I stand, four markets line the street, each a testament to the neighborhood’s newfound heritage.\n\nBut Bensonhurst is more than this. It is a tapestry of lives, stitched together by the hands of immigrants, their children, and their children’s children. And though the larger businesses may bear the mark of Asian ownership, the park nearby, newly touched by the hand of renovation, offers a place for all. There stand basketball courts, fields for the games of soccer and baseball, and swings where children’s laughter dances on the wind. Here, the water fountain sparkles under the summer sun, a brief respite from the city’s heat. And you’ll see the colors of the world in the faces that gather there, united in play and the common language of joy.\n\nIn this place, the sky is not broken by the hard lines of corporate towers. Instead, the buildings are homes, co-ops and condominiums, two-family houses where life spills out into the streets. The people are friendly, their voices a constant hum in the air, yet the roar of engines and the blare of music are their heralds, echoing through the dawn and into the night. Come nightfall, tread with care, for though the streets are safe, the hearts of men are ever unpredictable. There are those who might seek mischief, the bullies and the thieves who haunt the shadows. I have felt their malice in years past, yet time has softened their blows. But the thieves remain, their eyes set upon the packages left unguarded.\n\nAnd there is the matter of dogs. Their presence is marked not by their barking, but by the leavings they scatter upon the sidewalks. The city demands their owners clean the mess, but the rule is often ignored. It is a small thing, yet it rankles, a reminder of the city's untamed spirit. As you walk, watch your step, and keep your shoes clean, for the streets of Bensonhurst are as wild as they are welcoming.",
            "The first thing a soul must reckon with about Portland, Oregon, is the meaning of \"weird.\" There's a saying daubed on the backside of a building that juggles the trifecta of pizza, liquor, and music, with a foot in the shadows of law's good graces, and it reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a whispered echo of the Portland of the nineties and early aughts, a time when it was a quieter place, less burdened by fame's high price, a crucible of strange and wondrous subcultures. To others, it's a siren's call to the quirky and the odd, a place where \"weird\" is a crown to wear, not a scarlet letter. Despite the tide of wealth from Californian shores and the rise of steel and glass to house them, Portland holds fast to its weirdness. Weird doesn't equate to universal acceptance, but rather a tolerance for the unusual, the peculiar. It does not shun the comforts of modernity nor the battles they wage. Like every corner of this vast country, our shelves are stocked with goods from distant lands. There are myriad paths to strangeness, to deviation from the norm, yet Portland is rife with the ordinary. Yoga mats unfurl beneath hipsters and suits alike. Perhaps in Portland, weirdness means we dance through the mundane with a lighter step. In the neighborhood where I dwell, as in many corners of this city, there are homes ablaze with color, gardens tended with care, and in the summer, boxes left for free on the sidewalks. These boxes, more often than not, are humble cardboard vessels of discarded items, yet they hold something mystical, a boon for the passerby who dares to look. They brim with clothes and tomes but could contain anything. This serendipity of wandering through Southeast Portland captures its essence. At least, it does for me, though I am but one shade of weird among a spectrum. There are those among us who wouldn't deign to dress from a box on the street. They find joy amidst bleating goats in yoga or in the roar of the Timbers' faithful. Portland teems with souls chasing their dreams or dreaming within the amber haze of barroom light. Yes, Portland wrestles with its demons, the grip of substances a symptom of deeper wounds, perhaps exacerbated by the endless drizzle and sullen skies. There is a specter of homelessness too, a puzzle without a solver. The city's open arms, more generous than most, draw them near, but even here, the help falls short. The housed walk a line between compassion and disdain. In this, we are no stranger than any other place.",
            "The mountains loom eternal, an ancient witness to the sun's path, morning to night. They stand, immutable and indifferent to the whirl of human concerns, a steadfast presence against the fleeting moments of life. Oftentimes, in the thick of daily toil and turmoil, they fade from my mind, yet they remain, silent and stalwart. On days when the weight of the world bears down, they call out to be seen, and I turn to them. They offer solace to my weary spirit, a quiet strength urging me onward, step by step. \n\nI came to this place when my scholarly journey began, drawn by the mountains that guard the northern edge of the campus. The university itself boasts wonders in its edifices and ponds and trees, each staking a claim on my heart, yet it is the mountains that hold dominion. The town sprawls in its own beauty, a mosaic of cafes where time melts away in caffeinated frenzy. Venture further and the downtown wraps around you, its faded brick and mortar echoing a bygone era, a testament to the bustle and vigor that rivals the neighboring metropolis. \n\nBut this fervor is fleeting, giving way to the tranquil embrace of the small town, past the library's solemn walls. This duality, so close yet worlds apart, imbues the city with a mystique that begs exploration. Here, memories weave themselves into the fabric of the streets, each tied to a place. The rusted swings of the park, the hurried dash through downtown to the theater, the university's gift of cinema. Yet, like all places in life, it is home to shadows as well. The ponds, a sanctuary for contemplation, bear witness to tears shed in the silent hours of night, in the throes of existential dread. \n\nI have found myself there often, pondering the turtles and ducks, each creature playing its part in the grand tapestry of existence. I wondered then, lost in the labyrinth of life, about my own place and purpose. I walked on, past the pond, the park, the suburbia's quiet houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, and I looked up to see I was heading north. And there they were, as ever, the towering mountains brushing the heavens with their ancient peaks, voiceless yet stirring within me a resolve as old as the earth itself.",
            "You might pass it by at first, your eyes skimming over the unremarkable facade of a residential district set behind a strip of stores. It's not the kind of place that leaps out as a place to live, and certainly not one that most would choose to call home. Yet if you wander past the old Whole Foods, its doors long closed to the world, and slip behind the hotels that stir to life but once a year, you'll stumble upon a lively community unknown to the unseeing eye. These streets are lined with apartment complexes, assembled with the precision of Russian dolls, each one placed carefully beside the other in a row that stretches down the road like a tale being told in chapters. The first buildings you come upon have gained notoriety for unsavory affairs, tales best left untold, for appearances can deceive. But there are other complexes, worlds unto themselves, their existence a secret kept from the larger world. Across from these apartments stands a satellite campus of a community college, the buildings quiet and unassuming, where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, sleep still clinging to their eyes at the break of day. The gates groan open to admit them, while irate drivers bemoan the delay in their morning commute, the sound of their frustration echoing in the still air. The road meets another residential street, where a park shares a corner with a rehabilitation center for the broken-bodied. The center, with its inviting porch and languid ceiling fan, seems to breathe in the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the way, their laughter rising above the hum of bees amongst the flowers by the roadside. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at the skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls who whisper secrets by the swings. Beside the park, a sushi place offers modest fare to few patrons, flanked by a swimming supply store and a nail salon, each a cog in the wheel of the strip mall's charm. Here one could attend to the season's needs all at once—fill a pool, polish nails, and savor hibachi chicken. A frozen yogurt shop invites the youth, who navigate the park with cups in hand, their toppings melting in the sun's embrace as they ride their boards and exhale vapor into the heat. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, holds fast to its history in the somnolent South, where change comes as slowly as the turning of the earth.",
            "In the place where I live, there's a peculiar rhythm that clings to the bones of the earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved into two like a great beast bisected, yet still tethered together. My own dwelling has a patch of earth for a yard and a narrow strip of pavement for a drive. It is a remnant of a time not so distant when the suburbs were the promise of a new world, a dream woven into the fabric of the American vision. Once, this promise held the people in its embrace, but now it seems to slip away. Yet our neighborhood endures, a testament to dreams that refuse to die, voices still calling to those who wander through, whispering that the dream lingers still, though perhaps more tenuously than before.\n\nThe folks here don't carry the same spark of hope as once they did. The tidy patches of green have grown weary, but cars still rest in the drives, and the children, unaware, play as though the world they know is the only one that matters. The old school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a structure of hope for the young, a vessel of memory for the elders. Churches are sparse, their pews often empty, but the courts echo with the sound of basketballs and laughter. Each home has its own face but shares a common soul.\n\nA great supermarket, Super \"A\", stands, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs among us. The community is largely African American, the streets generous in their width, where children play their games, pausing only for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, people who can spin tales of a time when every face was familiar. A karate school once flourished, but with the waning of Hollywood's martial arts tales, it vanished, replaced by a pharmacy, for medicines are the new talismans, or so they say. There's a small theater showing films of yesteryear, a sanctuary for the old who find solace in the stories of the past, a place where they can escape without the clamor of youth.\n\nAn expressway cuts through the town, though its entrance and exit lie beyond our borders. There was talk once of petitioning for our own access, the younger ones eager, the elders wary. The threat of change and the wisdom of age led to its rejection, preserving a way of life they feared would be lost. Now, a new high school rises, and we ponder what symbol shall represent us. I reckon a cyborg with a drawl and a log cabin might just capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawling expanse of the city, where the towers rise like ancient sentinels and the streets weave a labyrinthine course through the heart of human enterprise, my neighborhood stands, a mosaic of disparate lives and ambitions. Here, the domiciles scatter themselves with a randomness that seems ordained by some capricious hand, interspersed with the commerce of men, their offices and shops, their eateries and theaters, all clamoring for space and attention. There is no end to the newness of restaurants, the novelty of stores, each one a testament to the ceaseless churn of society's appetite. The thoroughfares are lined with establishments both grand and obscure, the mighty chains of corporations standing shoulder to shoulder with the humble boutiques, each a sanctuary for the curious and the jaded alike.\n\nThe streets themselves, a testament to the city's ceaseless pulse, gird quiet enclaves that might have known serenity were they not encircled by such relentless activity. Parks, sparse yet treasured, offer a refuge where the young are brought to frolic under the watchful eyes of their guardians. And the people, oh the people, a tapestry of humanity woven from threads of every hue and creed. Within a stone's throw, the vibrant embrace of the LGBTQ+ community stands alongside the devout lives of Orthodox Jews, while those who fled the shadows of the old Soviet lands seek a new dawn here.\n\nBeyond, the city's great expanse unfurls more enclaves, each a world unto itself. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, each a bastion of culture and history, yet the road to these places is a trial in itself, for the city's veins are clogged with the lifeblood of its denizens, a mere ten miles a marathon of endurance through the gridlocked arteries of asphalt.\n\nIn this city, few tread the paths that once bore the weight of footfalls. The distances are vast, the hearts weary, and the preference is for wheels over soles. Thus, the city chokes on its own growth, the new edifices rising in defiance of the limits, promising homes yet bringing only the specter of further congestion. And yet, within this urban sprawl, the homes themselves bear witness to life's diversity. From the towering apartments to the modest homes, the duplexes and condominiums, each stands as a testament to the varied aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\nThe people too, a multitude of ages and stories, yet I find myself a stranger among them, the bonds of community frayed by the passage of time. The memories linger still, of childhood days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter shared and the innocence preserved. But now, the ties that bound us have loosened, and we are left adrift in this vast sea, each of us a solitary island in a city that never sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we passed the cornfields that stretched out to the horizon. This is it I said with the knowing that she’d be taken aback by the vastness and the emptiness of the land. She was from a place where the grocery store was but a short walk from her door and she’d never seen such open space in all her life. I told her of what it was to grow up in the rural heart of Ohio and in that telling she came to know what I was and where I came from. The country road was two lanes wide and it led to a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lay the small development where I lived. Brick and stucco houses stood solitary on their half-acre plots where the people took pride in their keeping. In the springtime the flowers bloomed and the trees of the Midwest changed with the seasons. Driveways held the finest Mercedes Benz cars that gleamed under the midday sun after a good washing. Down the road toward my grey stucco home my Korean neighbor stood outside with a friendly face. He spent his days mowing his lawn and his singing rose above the hum of the mower. The neighborhood laughed with him for he was a genuine soul with a past of his own. He had grown older and his wits had dulled with time. Once he’d been a doctor but now he blended in with the grass and his John Deere mower. At last you’ll find my home. Geese abound in the side yard with our Terrier in chase. In the back a stream fed into the quarry and there you could hear the bullfrogs and the water and sometimes the lowing of cows from distant farms. Across a bridge of wood was an untouched place where trees and herbs and wildflowers grew as they would. Here was where my childhood played out. We built forts in the trees and hunted animals that were mostly just chased away and there was ever a neighborhood child for company. The winters in that small town could be harsh but they held a beauty all their own. The yard turned from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees that had borne flowers of pink and purple and orange became skeletons of bark. When the snow came it was a wonderland that appeared by night’s end. The backyard was littered with snow angels my sister had made and snowmen stood guard. My sister and I fought often as children and in winter our weapon was the snowball. We built great forts like igloos to store our ammo and branches for our arsenal. In that wonderland we played and pretended and for a time nothing else mattered. We were just children without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small town Michigan, where the land stretches from fields of corn to the quaint allure of tourist towns, there are no sprawling malls to be found. No Wal-marts or Targets dot the landscape, and the likes of an Applebee’s are but a distant thought. The road stretches on and on, carrying you to wherever you need to be. Yet this place, this land wrapped in water’s embrace, is one of the Earth’s quiet marvels. Lake Michigan lies to one side, vast and ageless, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix whispers its secrets. A beach is never far, always there to welcome the weary foot.  \n\nThe town, small and unassuming, is a reflection of its own simplicity. The houses stand apart, not jostled in rows like soldiers. Each wears its own story, some fresh with the touch of time and others holding steadfast to the past. Basements lie below, their presence marked even from the road’s edge. Aluminum siding clings to many, painted in hues that defy the dullness of conformity. Yards spread out, hosting the laughter of children and the quiet industry of gardens. Fences keep watch over animals, and the homes speak of Middle America’s grit and grace. Here, folks labor for their bread, raising families or seeing them grown.  \n\nOn any given day, the streets live with the sound of children’s feet and the sight of dogs on their daily rounds. Bicycles weave their paths, and rollerblades carve their own. Neighbors know one another, and strangers are recognized in an instant. The scent of grilling drifts through the air, a silent invitation or a friendly greeting. Lawns are kept in tidy fashion, no leaves left to rot. The grass is green and obedient to the mower’s blade. Gardens and bushes are trimmed with care.  \n\nThis is not a place of grandeur, a neighborhood that catches the eye with its splendor. It is a place where families find their roots, where peace and safety hold sway. It stands not for beauty but for the promise of sanctuary at the day’s end. The sheriff’s department and jail are within a stone’s throw, the health department just a step beyond. The recycling center is close by, a resource for the community. Nearby fields echo with the calls of baseball games, the announcer’s voice a familiar refrain. The airport is a neighbor too, its small planes tracing the sky with their rumbles.  \n\nHere, an ice cream cone is a walk away, and downtown beckons to those willing to wander. Children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks down the road. This is a place of quiet contentment, a truly great place to call home.",
            "In the expanse where I dwell, the land unfolds in the familiar guise of a suburbia crafted from the same mold, a place where the hand of the homeowner's association rests heavy upon the earth. As you venture forth into this domain, the eye meets nothing but meticulously tended single-family homes, each a testament to the order imposed by the association. The yards stretch out in uniform assembly, small patches of manicured grass bordered by decorative stones, driveways that are scarcely more than suggestions. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, but they too are small and in keeping with the scheme. Every domicile boasts a garage for two cars, a testament to the sameness that prevails.\n\nAs the road wends through this neighborhood, its surface is fresh and unblemished, a smooth expanse unmarred by the ravages of time or neglect. Despite the multitude of lives that converge here, the streets bear no scars. Most houses rise but a single story, though occasionally a second story peers down upon the scene. The mailboxes, those sentinels of delivery, are absent from their expected stations before each house. Instead, they huddle together at the street's end, recalling the clustered arrangements of apartment dwellings. Each resident bears a key to unlock the mysteries of their designated slot, and larger lockers stand ready to hold parcels. This, too, is the handiwork of the HOA, with its relentless pursuit of uniformity.\n\nPerched on the city's edge, my neighborhood straddles the line between rural sprawl and suburban order. The land stretches wide, accommodating all manner of need. Community pools lie scattered, their waters well-kept and enclosed by gates, while trails meander through the landscape, inviting the solitary walker or the dog and its master to wander at will. No need to seek out parks for exercise; the neighborhood itself forms a circuit sufficient to the task. The community is a haven for those who have earned their rest, the retired souls who watch over one another. Yet amid them move a smattering of the middle-aged and the young, professionals making their way.\n\nThe city, for all its size in numbers, wears the guise of a small town, familiar and intimate. It offers the conveniences one might expect, a single mall standing as its commercial heart. Not vast, but sufficient to its purpose. A short drive leads to the bounty of stores, from the high-end grocers with their organic wares to the bargain outlets where economy dictates the rule of the day. In sum, the neighborhood stands as a bastion of safety and care, its paths and pools testament to its well-being. Though not in the shadow of commerce, it lies within reach, a short journey to the chains that satisfy the needs of the many.",
            "The first time I heard tell of my place was through a podcast about the vanished, the gone. It was a curious thing, that tale. Every apartment in these parts fetching over a thousand a month and not a whisper of such a story had reached my ears or those of my comrades. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know some of my friends weep into the night. Life's costly, but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed garments becomes a comfort. You smell less as the years press on you. Maybe you take to smoking or perhaps the state of things becomes your second skin. But the flea market, it never fails to declare itself. The aroma of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano. It burrows into leather and lingers despite any washing. Here, within steps lie three thrift stores. Begin from the far side and you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a dense thicket, cars and people coursing through its veins each morning, yet the thrifts remain a sanctuary of silence. No matter the throng outside, inside there's a hush. It's a fine place to lose the hours. More and more of them, each year. The floods of cars and people swell. They say the city is burgeoning, the heart of a great digital empire of trade and delivery, yet it wears its growing pains like a new skin. It brings to mind New York. Everyone and everything driven by their own destinies, asking little of you. Solitude, quietude, independence, they do not intrude upon you here. Not like the South where a touch of concern signals care. Here, lives are not pried open. The shell you wear can remain uncracked as long as you choose and the city's tides will crash and recede like the sea on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life. Between the pianist next door and the two hopeful singers upstairs, there's always a melody in the air. We are less an assembly of strangers and more a fellowship of friends. We gather in our needs, celebrate the births, mourn the deaths, offer aid when we can. In some way, fortune's smile found me here. I hold affection for most of my neighbors and they return it in kind. I mind my mess, share my food, and they reciprocate. We exchange letters and parcels. It's good to see them, and I reckon they find some pleasure in me as well. I dwell in a sprawling, indifferent modernity, yet it's folk like my neighbors that convince me I didn't wholly ruin my life.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest lies a town, small and unassuming, shadowed by the sprawling reach of a city whose lights can be seen on the horizon at night. On its eastern flank, the edge where the town frays, lies a neighborhood of humble means. Here, the homes bear the weight of years and lean close to one another in the dusk, their value measured not in dollars but in the lives lived within. Folks here are of a kind disposition, their faces quick to lift in greeting as one ambles down the street. The air holds a quiet, though not without its share of whispers of past violences, for in the span of a decade, blood has marked the sidewalks a time or two. Last year, the neighbors next door buried their boy, a casualty of a quarrel at a tavern not far. Yet, by some grace, our own have known only the small larcenies of porch pickers and the like.\n\nThis town, like so many, has felt the cold hand of the opioid scourge, with lives surrendered to the dark embrace of fentanyl. But the spirit here is not one to yield, and there are places and people who stand against the tide; centers for healing and hands that teach others to save. The schoolhouse, where my boy learns, is a place of warmth and care, filled with teachers who see each child for who they are. He, with his special needs, finds only acceptance there, wrapped in the kindness of a community that knows no bounds of difference. The school asks no price for the meals it serves, ensuring no child knows hunger, and seeks to ease the burden of costs that education brings.\n\nBeyond the school, the town has seen its face changed, roads smoothed and parks reborn, though these touches are felt most in the town’s heart and its western reaches. Here on the east, the work has been slow to come, leaving some to murmur discontent. Yet even so, there's a goodness in this place. The folk are kind, and the shops suffice, from the mom-and-pops to the larger marts. Our home, modest in its worth, offers all we need, and in its walls, we find our comfort. Sixteen years have passed with us here, and the thought of leaving seems a thing too strange to reckon.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like a living tapestry, its threads steeped in the weight of history. Buildings stand like sentinels, their facades whispering tales of an era long past. My own vantage is seven stories high, perched across from the venerable theater where echoes of performances linger like ghosts. Down the incline, the arcade bar glows in the summer dusk, drawing souls of every hue. On weekends, in the sultry embrace of June and July, they gather, a serpentine line waiting for entry into its neon embrace. A stone's throw from this hive of revelry lies the city park, a vast expanse amidst urban sprawl, surrounded by concrete walls and staircases carved from the same gray stone.\n\nIn the grip of winter, when the land shivers beneath a relentless rain, the homeless weave their sanctuary of canvas along the sidewalks and the wide, weathered steps. The snow is scarce, but the rain falls with a vengeance, and the chill seeps into the bones. Their tents huddle close, seeking warmth in proximity, the city’s heart offering refuge more hospitable than the wild outskirts. Here, they are within reach of the solitary family center, a place of respite where they can find the solace of a shower.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of architecture, the proud silhouette against the sky, that holds my love. It is the people, the pulse of life that thrums through the Hilltop. Once notorious, a battleground of gangs and violence, its tales of federal purges now weave through the air like folklore. The streets bear memories etched in asphalt and whispered in alleyways. The people labor with grit, striving to cleanse the stains of the past, their commitment to their block unwavering.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white soul after dark, a warning tinged with the bitterness of bygone days and the shadow of prejudice. But I walk its streets undeterred, perhaps passing as one of its own, my skin a testament to the blurred lines of identity. Hilltop knows me, recognizes the kinship of one who sees the scars our nation wears. Here in this supposed utopia of cultures, ignorance and fear still cast their long shadows.\n\nYet Hilltop is my home, the place where my spirit finds its rhythm. In the night, life hums around me, offering warmth and kindness in unexpected ways. A stranger's coat, a laundromat’s light kept burning a moment longer, a gift of acknowledgment on a rain-soaked night. Here, amidst the concrete and chaos, I find beauty and worth, a reminder that the heart of the city beats strongest in its people.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unknowable. Friends were hard to come by at first, but I found a bond with a boy two houses down and another who lived along the same street. They've since moved on but the echoes of those days linger. The faces that greeted me then remain for the most part unchanged. This place, it's much like any other American suburb with its rows of two-story homes standing in quiet testament to the passage of days. On weekends or whenever the sun graces us with warmth, the laughter of children fills the air. Silence holds sway through the week. There's a solitude here, untouched unless help is needed. Packages arrive at my door untampered, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies a stone's throw from my home, a place etched with memories both bright and bruised. We've played ball games there, the fields bearing witness to our youthful follies and triumphs. Once, a stray elbow bloodied my nose, a painful lesson amidst camaraderie, yet the joys far outweigh the sorrows. Now, the park's a place of nostalgia, where I take my cousin's young ones to play on swings and slides. Their excitement rekindles a spark within me. This neighborhood's a tapestry of diversity, flavors from far-off lands within reach. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all within a mile's journey. Yet many now summon their meals through screens, relying on the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple in any suburb. Pizza places abound. Shops here offer all one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco stand ready to serve. Even the stores reflect a cultural mosaic, an Indian-owned shop for those craving a taste of the homeland. I hold this neighborhood in high regard. The tales of discord I read online or hear on the news only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The place where I lay my head is a stone's throw from the college grounds, and for that, there's a quiet satisfaction in my dwelling. The structures rise as old sentinels, mostly apartments, their bones ancient but their insides remade. There are eateries and taverns scattered like seeds, places to find a bit of cheer without the weight of gold. One bar, newly christened, demands more from the purse but offers a fair exchange in spirits and service. The folk here are mostly kind, drawn from the ranks of students or those of modest means, for the rent does not ask much of a man.\n\nChildren abound, their laughter a testament to the nearby school, a short stroll from my door. I know not my neighbors, nor do I yearn to. They smoke the green herb, and the management, in its wisdom, placed a scent machine outside their door, a jest that my companion and I find nearly an affront. The edifices that surround me wear the years like a cloak, yet within, they might shine with newness. Further down the way, fresh apartments rise, though I trust them not, for their making was a thing of haste and economy. They charge dearly for what they offer, a ruse, but the nearness to the campus allows such tricks.\n\nA humble eatery lies a short walk away, its offerings served on paper, warmed not by flame but by the hum of a microwave. Across the way stands a gas station, its reputation as dismal as its patrons. Yet the city saw fit to lay new paths last summer, wide and green-bordered, lending a touch of grace to this slice of the world. My building stands cloaked in trees, though some have been felled, leaving behind their stumps like memories. Beyond the line of timber, more apartments loom.\n\nI dwell on 42nd Street, with 43rd a shadow behind, its visage less fair. The paths there crumble, and the buildings wear their shabbiness like a second skin. Trees crowd the street, perhaps to mask the decay beneath. Crime finds its home in the complex on that street, though not solely there, for across from me the same shadows gather, the people ever changing. Yet this place holds me, for it suits my purse and meets my needs. The university is but a short walk, and the buses run their routes to carry me to the market and the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of the road in a cul-de-sac where the duplexes stand like sentinels against time, each painted a yellow hue with white porches and roofs of green metal that glint in the sun. The houses, spaced and placed with intention yet seeming random, hold a camaraderie among their inhabitants, not all but most, who gather of an evening at some unchosen driveway and speak of the day while the children play, their laughter a melody to the unfolding dusk. It’s a refuge from the world’s relentless march of machines and wires, a return to what once was, surrounded by fields and trees under skies of blue wherein clouds drift like ships on a forgotten sea. \n\nYet this season brings with it omens, the air thick with the threat of tornadoes, and for the first time last night the sirens wailed their warning. We took to shelter as best we could. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, purse and pillows clutched close, while the big dog lingered in the living room, barking at the storm’s unseen fury. The hail came down like stones cast by an invisible hand, and when the storm passed, the road steamed under the sun’s sudden return, the temperature dropping as if the earth itself had shivered. Hail melted on the pavement, and as the sky cleared, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a covenant of peace. I fetched my camera and captured this wonder to share with kin and friend alike. \n\nThe streets stayed silent, the world holding its breath until folk returned from wherever they’d been, and life resumed its pace with mothers and children outside while suppers cooked. This place, new to me from the north, is a haven with its accents and its warmth. Each dwelling, though similar outside, hides a world within, some small, some spacious, unexplained. I walk the fields and pond near my home, where deer step quietly and the bullfrog sings his morning song, a symphony of nature not meant for swimmers. It’s a fine life, just a stone’s throw from Charlotte, where roosters crow the day awake and a donkey brays from the farm as night falls. In this small community, I’ve found a treasure.",
            "In the quiet of ten years gone by, I find the words to lay bare what I have seen. First, there was a sadness that clung to me when I arrived in this place. I had come from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore at me, for I loved them I left behind. But my folks reckoned on a better life for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with finer houses, a school not marked by the shadows of want. In time, I grew accustomed to it and found new company, friends and foes alike. The neighbors remained distant figures, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis, who lived to either side. They became as family in a way, and I am grateful for their presence. I recall the day we went to Mr. Glen’s wedding anew, a joyous occasion. We danced beneath the stars, and I caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though the flowers eluded me. I danced with Marsharii, their daughter, though she slipped away into the world beyond my reach. I reckon she found her path. \n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a labyrinth, though with the aid of a GPS, I wander further afield. In the company of Kason and Curtis, we roamed and reveled in the simple joy of existence. The park offered solace, a balm for the soul, where I’d take up sticks from the depot and test my balance, wielding my wooden sword with a quiet joy. The courts lie waiting, basketball and tennis, though long has it been since I played. My father and Mr. Graves instilled in us a love for tennis, and those times with my best friend remain etched in my memory, a testament to the pleasures found in toil. These memories linger, bright and steadfast, yet I hold to the belief that the finest days lie ahead, waiting to unfold.",
            "In this little township of Johnston, where the roads whisper through the fields and the sky stretches unbroken, there lies a quietude that belies its true worth. The land is stitched in rows of peach trees, a kingdom of fruit that marks its claim as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it wears with a proud humility upon its welcoming sign. The air is thick with the scent of earth and promise, a testament to the toil of those who work its soil. Houses are scattered across the land, standing solitary and watchful with their metal crowns or gray shingles, their distance from the road a testament to the land's purpose. They stand back, granting space for the fields to breathe and grow.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads, casting its red glow upon the handful of stores that gather there. Hong Kong, a modest family-run diner, serves its fare with the warmth of home. Fiesta Mexican and Gary’s, a small burger joint, round out the trifecta of quick eats. The pizzeria, once a staple, now lingers only in memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a pharmacy of small stature but great repute, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, a sweet indulgence amid the medicinal shelves. The IGA grocery stands alone in its role, yet many journey to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their bounty, leaving the IGA for the quick necessities.\n\nDollar General, a bastion of the everyday, hums with life from dawn till dusk. Possibilities Furniture & More sits quietly, a repository of chairs and tables dreamed into being by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the store itself. Her two movers, silent as shadows, bear the weight of new beginnings to doorsteps near and far. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures with a gentle hand, offering pampering and care in equal measure.\n\nBeyond the reach of the town's center, the doctor and the vet hold their own courts, small yet capable, ready to mend man and beast alike. Johnston Elementary stands as the lone beacon of early education, sending its charges onward to the next town's schools when their time comes. The promise of a new park, a 2.5-acre haven in the making, whispers of future gatherings and laughter, a balm for the absence of theaters and bowling alleys, of playgrounds and promenades.\n\nJohnston is a place you might miss if you blink, a town where time seems to pause, caught in the gentle rhythm of its own making. Yet, for those who know it, it is a place of quiet significance, where the land and its people are entwined in a story as old as the hills themselves.",
            "In a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself ensconced in a suburb that stretches between two state highways, a connector of sorts, where the flow of traffic ebbs and swells more than I care for. Yet despite this, a quietude blankets the neighborhood, a stillness interrupted only by the familiar rhythms of daily life. Folks here, they don't come and go as they might elsewhere. The faces are known, the names spoken in the same breath as the seasons.\n\nThe land is tended with diligence, yards pruned and preened, chores met with a resigned constancy. In the chill of winter, we take to sledding down the hill that slopes from the side street. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, a watchtower from which we observe the daily procession, each vehicle a known entity, each stranger's car noted with a careful eye. Neighbors take to walking, for exercise or company, dogs trotting faithfully beside them. Children wheel about on bicycles, a dance of innocence and laughter.\n\nWork anchors us at home, my wife and I, along with our daughters, sisters of eleven and fourteen years. Our comings and goings are as familiar to the neighborhood as the hum of lawn mowers that sing out from March to October. The trees, remnants of a forest past, cast their shadows, and in the fall, the leaves descend in a rustling avalanche, demanding rake and flame. The scent of their burning is a herald of autumn's reign.\n\nWinter has grown elusive, a fleeting specter, leaving us in the embrace of an extended fall. Our garage, tucked at the back, serves as both a workshop and a window to the world outside. On rare occasions when the front door is summoned, it is a reminder that life persists beyond our own.\n\nHolidays creep in with a quietude, the streets swelling with the return of kin, cars lining the curbs and driveways. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—they come and go, leaving in their wake a deeper silence.\n\nIn all of this, there is a contentment, a satisfaction in the familiarity of place. Were it not for the road that cuts through, it might be perfect.",
            "In the midst of the high desert, my neighborhood sits, surrounded by the relentless expanse of dirt and more dirt, an unending sea of brown. It is a place where the sight of a green lawn is a rare spectacle, a testament to the homeowner’s resolve and the depths of their pockets. Back in the 90s, when I first laid my roots here, the houses were scattered and sparse, the land wide and open. It remains much the same today, though new structures creep in, pushing the boundaries of what was once untouched. The desert slowly takes on the guise of a city, a transformation not unfamiliar to many places. Yet, the heart of it remains, with folks who greet you with warmth, a kindness that speaks of simpler times. My corner of this place is blessed with the company of friendly old souls, a sanctuary of sorts.\n\nThe stores that line our streets are the usual suspects, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, their chains stretching far and wide. For the upscale, one must journey beyond the familiar, for Whole Foods and the like are strangers here. Construction thrives in this landscape, the promise of development in every open space, a reminder of change that looms ever present. It unnerves me, this relentless march towards the future. I fled the clamor of the big city once, and I am loath to return. I work in construction, a drywall and T-bar installer by trade, and I find solace in the creatures of this desert land. \n\nThe high desert draws many, enchanted by its stark beauty and the life that clings to its harsh embrace. Its ecosystems are fragile, demanding our respect and understanding. My family has learned to coexist with the wildlife, and my children revel in the pursuit of lizards and desert insects, their laughter echoing under the vast sky. \n\nVictorville offers its own allure, a gateway for families to taste the desert’s unique flavor. The San Bernardino County Fair, a yearly spectacle, promises a blend of joy and tradition. Nearby, the snow-draped peaks of Wrightwood beckon, a call to winter’s embrace. For those drawn to the tales of the past, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of stories told through geological specimens and artifacts, a chronicle of Victorville’s journey through time.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, there's a certain peculiarity in the way it lays itself out in my mind. For most who'd answer such a question, they'd conjure up images of homes and streets and life unfolding in its ordinary ways. But mine is a different story. My neighborhood is the college campus where I dwell, and the souls in my dormitory make up the tapestry of my community. The campus itself, sprawling and indifferent, is the backdrop of this peculiar neighborhood, an extension of its reach, though less intimate.\n\nYet even in its strange constitution, my neighborhood shares echoes with the neighborhoods of old. It has its houses, its people, its stores, and its parks. Let's speak first of these \"houses\" that form the skeleton of my abode. The types of dwellings here are varied. There are apartments, true houses, and dormitory halls.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll find between two to four souls sharing a room, and each floor holds about four to six such rooms. The buildings rise for two floors typically, housing around twenty individuals. Then there are the houses, scarce and scattered, standing as relics for those tied to the institution, alumni mostly, who rent them out. They are fewer, less efficient in their scarcity. Lastly, the dormitories rise like ancient monoliths, sheltering hundreds of students. Here, two to a room is the rule, with exceptions that prove it, and this is the most common shelter where I lay my head.\n\nHaving covered housing, we turn now to the people. My school wears its diversity like a badge, and this is mirrored in the neighborhood's populace. People of every culture and age reside here. The professional staff find their place in the scattered houses, while the dormitories welcome the new arrivals, and the apartments become havens for those who have grown older in this place.\n\nYet to speak of these people in mere words is to do them a disservice. So let us move to the stores and parks. This self-contained world of my school has its own assortment of stores, a mixture of dining establishments akin to any neighborhood, alongside the unique branding of the school’s own shops for clothing and groceries. Within these bounds, all needs find their fulfillment.\n\nAnd then there is the park, a sanctuary for all, kept immaculate and safe through the collective efforts of the neighborhood's denizens, a testament to the diverse life that breathes within this peculiar, self-sustaining enclave.",
            "There are no sidewalks in this place. The earth falls away in long sweeping inclines and my house stands at the crest of the steepest hill, a monument to the incline's defiance. The folk around here call it the workout hill, a nod to the sweat and breath of joggers who labor against its grade. On my street, there is no stone path for walking, and folk take to the road. The road is pocked and scarred, a thing of danger underfoot and wheel alike. Wires hang in weblike tangles, their tattered strands a testament to the storms that rage and the arboreal debris that tears them asunder, the scars of their mending etched in patchwork. Tall evergreens stand in solemn watch, casting their shadows long and deep. Yet the people here loathe these ancient sentinels, for they block the ocean's visage. Houses rise high on the hill, glass-fronted monoliths reaching for the bay's distant embrace. Come sunset, the water glows with a fire from beneath, the sky a canvas washed in orange. But clouds, more frequent than not, shroud these visions with their pallor. The days are gray and damp, and a green moss creeps over all things, roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, a month gone by, my car lay untouched, and when I came to it, the moss had claimed it as its own. It took me hours to strip it bare, its surface green and furred. Children are scarce, though a school stands not far away. The folk here are mostly of age, their work behind them. In place of children, there are dogs, a common sight on lawns or in chase down the street. Leave a door unguarded and you may find one in your parlor, as I did, only to shoo it out again. Rabbits roam wild and free, the gardeners their sworn enemies for the burrows and uprooted plants they leave in their wake. My cats, they revel in the hunt, and the rabbits know their days are numbered. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds in their finery, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crow's black malice. Stores are absent here, but a trek downhill to the shore reveals eateries where the sea's bounty is served. The beach is but a rocky margin, yet to cast stones into the bay is a joy of sorts. The bay is narrow, and even in the mist, the far shore is clear to the eye.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, where the city sprawls out in iron and stone, there lies a neighborhood called Bensonhurst. It is not hard to find. The veins of public transportation run through it like blood through the body of the city, and the trains clatter along the tracks in their ceaseless rhythm. You’ll find yourself in the heart of the city, amidst its urban cadence and the ever-watchful gaze of its towering edifices. As you walk the streets, you’ll see storefronts adorned with bright signs and the delicate calligraphy of a distant land. For in these past decades, many from across the vast reaches of Asia have come to make this place their own. At every turn, there’s a market or a laundromat, their doors open to the hurrying throngs, and the air is rich with the scent of spices and the chatter of languages. These shops are beloved by the locals for their bounty, their prices, and the ease with which they weave into the lives of those who dwell here. Just a stone’s throw from where I stand, four markets line the street, each a testament to the neighborhood’s newfound heritage.\n\nBut Bensonhurst is more than this. It is a tapestry of lives, stitched together by the hands of immigrants, their children, and their children’s children. And though the larger businesses may bear the mark of Asian ownership, the park nearby, newly touched by the hand of renovation, offers a place for all. There stand basketball courts, fields for the games of soccer and baseball, and swings where children’s laughter dances on the wind. Here, the water fountain sparkles under the summer sun, a brief respite from the city’s heat. And you’ll see the colors of the world in the faces that gather there, united in play and the common language of joy.\n\nIn this place, the sky is not broken by the hard lines of corporate towers. Instead, the buildings are homes, co-ops and condominiums, two-family houses where life spills out into the streets. The people are friendly, their voices a constant hum in the air, yet the roar of engines and the blare of music are their heralds, echoing through the dawn and into the night. Come nightfall, tread with care, for though the streets are safe, the hearts of men are ever unpredictable. There are those who might seek mischief, the bullies and the thieves who haunt the shadows. I have felt their malice in years past, yet time has softened their blows. But the thieves remain, their eyes set upon the packages left unguarded.\n\nAnd there is the matter of dogs. Their presence is marked not by their barking, but by the leavings they scatter upon the sidewalks. The city demands their owners clean the mess, but the rule is often ignored. It is a small thing, yet it rankles, a reminder of the city's untamed spirit. As you walk, watch your step, and keep your shoes clean, for the streets of Bensonhurst are as wild as they are welcoming.",
            "The first thing a soul must reckon with about Portland, Oregon, is the meaning of \"weird.\" There's a saying daubed on the backside of a building that juggles the trifecta of pizza, liquor, and music, with a foot in the shadows of law's good graces, and it reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a whispered echo of the Portland of the nineties and early aughts, a time when it was a quieter place, less burdened by fame's high price, a crucible of strange and wondrous subcultures. To others, it's a siren's call to the quirky and the odd, a place where \"weird\" is a crown to wear, not a scarlet letter. Despite the tide of wealth from Californian shores and the rise of steel and glass to house them, Portland holds fast to its weirdness. Weird doesn't equate to universal acceptance, but rather a tolerance for the unusual, the peculiar. It does not shun the comforts of modernity nor the battles they wage. Like every corner of this vast country, our shelves are stocked with goods from distant lands. There are myriad paths to strangeness, to deviation from the norm, yet Portland is rife with the ordinary. Yoga mats unfurl beneath hipsters and suits alike. Perhaps in Portland, weirdness means we dance through the mundane with a lighter step. In the neighborhood where I dwell, as in many corners of this city, there are homes ablaze with color, gardens tended with care, and in the summer, boxes left for free on the sidewalks. These boxes, more often than not, are humble cardboard vessels of discarded items, yet they hold something mystical, a boon for the passerby who dares to look. They brim with clothes and tomes but could contain anything. This serendipity of wandering through Southeast Portland captures its essence. At least, it does for me, though I am but one shade of weird among a spectrum. There are those among us who wouldn't deign to dress from a box on the street. They find joy amidst bleating goats in yoga or in the roar of the Timbers' faithful. Portland teems with souls chasing their dreams or dreaming within the amber haze of barroom light. Yes, Portland wrestles with its demons, the grip of substances a symptom of deeper wounds, perhaps exacerbated by the endless drizzle and sullen skies. There is a specter of homelessness too, a puzzle without a solver. The city's open arms, more generous than most, draw them near, but even here, the help falls short. The housed walk a line between compassion and disdain. In this, we are no stranger than any other place.",
            "The mountains loom eternal, an ancient witness to the sun's path, morning to night. They stand, immutable and indifferent to the whirl of human concerns, a steadfast presence against the fleeting moments of life. Oftentimes, in the thick of daily toil and turmoil, they fade from my mind, yet they remain, silent and stalwart. On days when the weight of the world bears down, they call out to be seen, and I turn to them. They offer solace to my weary spirit, a quiet strength urging me onward, step by step. \n\nI came to this place when my scholarly journey began, drawn by the mountains that guard the northern edge of the campus. The university itself boasts wonders in its edifices and ponds and trees, each staking a claim on my heart, yet it is the mountains that hold dominion. The town sprawls in its own beauty, a mosaic of cafes where time melts away in caffeinated frenzy. Venture further and the downtown wraps around you, its faded brick and mortar echoing a bygone era, a testament to the bustle and vigor that rivals the neighboring metropolis. \n\nBut this fervor is fleeting, giving way to the tranquil embrace of the small town, past the library's solemn walls. This duality, so close yet worlds apart, imbues the city with a mystique that begs exploration. Here, memories weave themselves into the fabric of the streets, each tied to a place. The rusted swings of the park, the hurried dash through downtown to the theater, the university's gift of cinema. Yet, like all places in life, it is home to shadows as well. The ponds, a sanctuary for contemplation, bear witness to tears shed in the silent hours of night, in the throes of existential dread. \n\nI have found myself there often, pondering the turtles and ducks, each creature playing its part in the grand tapestry of existence. I wondered then, lost in the labyrinth of life, about my own place and purpose. I walked on, past the pond, the park, the suburbia's quiet houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, and I looked up to see I was heading north. And there they were, as ever, the towering mountains brushing the heavens with their ancient peaks, voiceless yet stirring within me a resolve as old as the earth itself.",
            "You might pass it by at first, your eyes skimming over the unremarkable facade of a residential district set behind a strip of stores. It's not the kind of place that leaps out as a place to live, and certainly not one that most would choose to call home. Yet if you wander past the old Whole Foods, its doors long closed to the world, and slip behind the hotels that stir to life but once a year, you'll stumble upon a lively community unknown to the unseeing eye. These streets are lined with apartment complexes, assembled with the precision of Russian dolls, each one placed carefully beside the other in a row that stretches down the road like a tale being told in chapters. The first buildings you come upon have gained notoriety for unsavory affairs, tales best left untold, for appearances can deceive. But there are other complexes, worlds unto themselves, their existence a secret kept from the larger world. Across from these apartments stands a satellite campus of a community college, the buildings quiet and unassuming, where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, sleep still clinging to their eyes at the break of day. The gates groan open to admit them, while irate drivers bemoan the delay in their morning commute, the sound of their frustration echoing in the still air. The road meets another residential street, where a park shares a corner with a rehabilitation center for the broken-bodied. The center, with its inviting porch and languid ceiling fan, seems to breathe in the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the way, their laughter rising above the hum of bees amongst the flowers by the roadside. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at the skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls who whisper secrets by the swings. Beside the park, a sushi place offers modest fare to few patrons, flanked by a swimming supply store and a nail salon, each a cog in the wheel of the strip mall's charm. Here one could attend to the season's needs all at once—fill a pool, polish nails, and savor hibachi chicken. A frozen yogurt shop invites the youth, who navigate the park with cups in hand, their toppings melting in the sun's embrace as they ride their boards and exhale vapor into the heat. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, holds fast to its history in the somnolent South, where change comes as slowly as the turning of the earth.",
            "In the place where I live, there's a peculiar rhythm that clings to the bones of the earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved into two like a great beast bisected, yet still tethered together. My own dwelling has a patch of earth for a yard and a narrow strip of pavement for a drive. It is a remnant of a time not so distant when the suburbs were the promise of a new world, a dream woven into the fabric of the American vision. Once, this promise held the people in its embrace, but now it seems to slip away. Yet our neighborhood endures, a testament to dreams that refuse to die, voices still calling to those who wander through, whispering that the dream lingers still, though perhaps more tenuously than before.\n\nThe folks here don't carry the same spark of hope as once they did. The tidy patches of green have grown weary, but cars still rest in the drives, and the children, unaware, play as though the world they know is the only one that matters. The old school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a structure of hope for the young, a vessel of memory for the elders. Churches are sparse, their pews often empty, but the courts echo with the sound of basketballs and laughter. Each home has its own face but shares a common soul.\n\nA great supermarket, Super \"A\", stands, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs among us. The community is largely African American, the streets generous in their width, where children play their games, pausing only for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, people who can spin tales of a time when every face was familiar. A karate school once flourished, but with the waning of Hollywood's martial arts tales, it vanished, replaced by a pharmacy, for medicines are the new talismans, or so they say. There's a small theater showing films of yesteryear, a sanctuary for the old who find solace in the stories of the past, a place where they can escape without the clamor of youth.\n\nAn expressway cuts through the town, though its entrance and exit lie beyond our borders. There was talk once of petitioning for our own access, the younger ones eager, the elders wary. The threat of change and the wisdom of age led to its rejection, preserving a way of life they feared would be lost. Now, a new high school rises, and we ponder what symbol shall represent us. I reckon a cyborg with a drawl and a log cabin might just capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawling expanse of the city, where the towers rise like ancient sentinels and the streets weave a labyrinthine course through the heart of human enterprise, my neighborhood stands, a mosaic of disparate lives and ambitions. Here, the domiciles scatter themselves with a randomness that seems ordained by some capricious hand, interspersed with the commerce of men, their offices and shops, their eateries and theaters, all clamoring for space and attention. There is no end to the newness of restaurants, the novelty of stores, each one a testament to the ceaseless churn of society's appetite. The thoroughfares are lined with establishments both grand and obscure, the mighty chains of corporations standing shoulder to shoulder with the humble boutiques, each a sanctuary for the curious and the jaded alike.\n\nThe streets themselves, a testament to the city's ceaseless pulse, gird quiet enclaves that might have known serenity were they not encircled by such relentless activity. Parks, sparse yet treasured, offer a refuge where the young are brought to frolic under the watchful eyes of their guardians. And the people, oh the people, a tapestry of humanity woven from threads of every hue and creed. Within a stone's throw, the vibrant embrace of the LGBTQ+ community stands alongside the devout lives of Orthodox Jews, while those who fled the shadows of the old Soviet lands seek a new dawn here.\n\nBeyond, the city's great expanse unfurls more enclaves, each a world unto itself. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, each a bastion of culture and history, yet the road to these places is a trial in itself, for the city's veins are clogged with the lifeblood of its denizens, a mere ten miles a marathon of endurance through the gridlocked arteries of asphalt.\n\nIn this city, few tread the paths that once bore the weight of footfalls. The distances are vast, the hearts weary, and the preference is for wheels over soles. Thus, the city chokes on its own growth, the new edifices rising in defiance of the limits, promising homes yet bringing only the specter of further congestion. And yet, within this urban sprawl, the homes themselves bear witness to life's diversity. From the towering apartments to the modest homes, the duplexes and condominiums, each stands as a testament to the varied aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\nThe people too, a multitude of ages and stories, yet I find myself a stranger among them, the bonds of community frayed by the passage of time. The memories linger still, of childhood days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter shared and the innocence preserved. But now, the ties that bound us have loosened, and we are left adrift in this vast sea, each of us a solitary island in a city that never sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we passed the cornfields that stretched out to the horizon. This is it I said with the knowing that she’d be taken aback by the vastness and the emptiness of the land. She was from a place where the grocery store was but a short walk from her door and she’d never seen such open space in all her life. I told her of what it was to grow up in the rural heart of Ohio and in that telling she came to know what I was and where I came from. The country road was two lanes wide and it led to a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lay the small development where I lived. Brick and stucco houses stood solitary on their half-acre plots where the people took pride in their keeping. In the springtime the flowers bloomed and the trees of the Midwest changed with the seasons. Driveways held the finest Mercedes Benz cars that gleamed under the midday sun after a good washing. Down the road toward my grey stucco home my Korean neighbor stood outside with a friendly face. He spent his days mowing his lawn and his singing rose above the hum of the mower. The neighborhood laughed with him for he was a genuine soul with a past of his own. He had grown older and his wits had dulled with time. Once he’d been a doctor but now he blended in with the grass and his John Deere mower. At last you’ll find my home. Geese abound in the side yard with our Terrier in chase. In the back a stream fed into the quarry and there you could hear the bullfrogs and the water and sometimes the lowing of cows from distant farms. Across a bridge of wood was an untouched place where trees and herbs and wildflowers grew as they would. Here was where my childhood played out. We built forts in the trees and hunted animals that were mostly just chased away and there was ever a neighborhood child for company. The winters in that small town could be harsh but they held a beauty all their own. The yard turned from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees that had borne flowers of pink and purple and orange became skeletons of bark. When the snow came it was a wonderland that appeared by night’s end. The backyard was littered with snow angels my sister had made and snowmen stood guard. My sister and I fought often as children and in winter our weapon was the snowball. We built great forts like igloos to store our ammo and branches for our arsenal. In that wonderland we played and pretended and for a time nothing else mattered. We were just children without a care in the world."
