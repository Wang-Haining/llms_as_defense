            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, there lies a small town in Michigan, where fields stretch out to touch quaint tourist hamlets. There are no sprawling malls nor the bright lights of Wal-mart or Target, not even the hum of an Applebee's. To reach anywhere, one must drive, yet this place stands among the most beautiful in the world, cradled by water on all sides. My town is flanked by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever your feet may wander, a beach waits to welcome them. \n\nThe neighborhood is a testament to small-town life. Houses breathe with space between them, not the uniform sameness of modern developments. Some are relics, lovingly restored, while others bear the marks of age. Most have full basements visible from the street. Time has clad many in aluminum siding, and each home stands painted in a spectrum that defies imagination. Yards stretch out with their own stories, trampolines and playsets dot the landscape. Gardens grow, and fences keep watch over their charges. These homes speak of Middle America, of those who toil and labor, raising families or having seen them grow and leave.\n\nOn any day, the streets are alive with children, their laughter echoing. Dogs trot beside their owners, bicycles whir past, and rollerblades skim the pavement. Neighbors nod in recognition, a quiet understanding of who belongs and who does not. The scent of grilling drifts by, a wave exchanged between strangers who are not quite strangers. Lawns lie neat, leaves banished with the passing of fall. Grass grows green and the plants are neatly trimmed. It is not a place of grandeur but one of substance, where you sense the goodness of raising a family. Quiet, peaceful, safe—a sanctuary in its own right.\n\nWithin walking distance, the county sheriff's department stands guard, the health department by its side. Down the road, the city recycling center serves its people. Nearby, the crack of bats and the call of names echo from the fields, where baseball and softball games unfold. A small airport hums at the edge, planes taking off and landing, their rhythms a part of the town's pulse. Ice cream can be found with a short walk, and downtown is but a stretch of the legs away. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks distant. It is, indeed, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I abide could be likened to the endless rows of houses that stretch in ordered lines like soldiers on parade, each indistinguishable from the next. In this enclave, the hand of the homeowner's association is evident, their presence as palpable as the asphalt underfoot. As you cross the threshold, your eyes are met with the sight of homes cared for with a meticulousness that speaks of the association's watchful eye. Each yard a mirror to its neighbor, patches of manicured grass bordered by pebbles, driveways short and squat, trees that stand not much taller than a man grown. Garages built for two stand sentinel beside each home. As you wind your way through these streets, the concrete before you is smooth, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. Here, the roads are kept as if new, a testament to the many families who call this place home, yet not one pothole mars the surface. The houses, mostly one story, but for the occasional two, rise like the modest dreams of their builders. The post is not delivered to the door as one might expect, but rather to a communal gathering of metal boxes at the street's end, each with its own key, that grants access to letters and parcels alike. Again, the association's preference for orderliness is to thank.  \n\nSituated at the city's far-flung edge, where suburb meets the till of country soil, there is room enough for all manner of things. Pools, clear and well-kept, lie behind their fences, open to all who dwell within. Paths wind through the land, inviting the solitary walker or the company of a dog. Here, exercise does not demand a park; the neighborhood's breadth is its own track. Retirees form the backbone of this place, their presence lending a sense of security and watchfulness. Yet among them are those younger, professionals still in the midst of their working years. The city beyond, though populous, retains the heart of a small town. It offers what one might need, including a solitary mall, sufficient in its humble way. The journey to the city's heart takes but a quarter of an hour, where stores of all kinds await, from the organic to the frugal, each serving its purpose in the tapestry of commerce. This neighborhood, in its quiet and well-tended way, embodies the spirit of safety and care. While not nestled among the shops, a short drive opens the world of commerce to one's choosing.",
            "It was the first I'd heard of the place, the tale of it come to me while listening to a podcast about folks vanished into thin air. That took me aback some. Seemed every flat in them parts was priced through the roof, over a thousand a month. Strange thing was, neither I nor my friends had caught wind of such a story. Maybe it’s the struggle, I reckon. Some nights, I know, there are those among us who find sleep only through tears. Life ain't cheap, but we've learned the art of making do. You come to find a fondness for the musty scent of flea market trinkets and clothes long sealed in camphor. Life smells less when you're grown. Perhaps you take up smoking, or maybe you just grow too used to the way of things. Yet the flea market, it never fails to make its presence known. The scent of adulthood is like old magazines piled atop a shut piano. It settles into the leather and lingers even after a good scrub. Round here, you’ve got three thrift stores within a stroll. From one end, you can make the rounds to a couple of charity shops, a library, a rare book nook, and a curio emporium. Downtown is a crush, cars and folks filling the streets each dawn, yet inside the thrifts, it’s hushed. No matter the throng outside, the shop holds its silence. A fine spot to lose the hours of a day. And every year, there are more of those. Cars and people surging through. They call it a burgeoning city. Headquarters to one of the largest online empires for trade and delivery, it's still finding its legs. Brings to mind New York, where everyone chases their own stars, asking little of you. Here, solitude and silence are your own, and they grant you that. Not like the South, where a touch of concern means you care. No prying into lives here, truly. You can keep your guard up as long as you see fit, and the city will go on crashing and receding like waves on the shore. It's a place alive with life. Between the pianist next door and the two aspiring singers above, there’s always some manner of song. In some ways, it feels less like a flat of strangers and more a fellowship of kin. We gather for our needs, mark birthdays, grieve our losses, lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be among them. I find a liking in most of my neighbors, and they seem to treat me kindly in turn. I mind my mess and share my food, and they return the favor. I fetch their mail and they mine. It gladdens me to see them, and I dare say they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I dwell in this sprawling, unfeeling modernity, but it's folk like my neighbors what make me feel I ain't completely botched my life.",
            "In a place where the flat lands stretch out beneath the big sky, I make my home. It's a small town in the Midwest, clinging to the edges of a city that looms with its glass and steel. This town, or at least the part where I reside, has seen better days. On the eastern edge, where the sun rises over tired houses, the economy has cast its shadow long and cold. The houses there are humble, some worn with the years, others held together by the dreams of those who barely own them.\n\nYet it is not a place without its charms. The folks here, they nod and smile as you pass by, a silent fellowship bound by shared circumstance. The streets whisper of events that have come and gone, the kind that leave a mark. Crimes have brushed past our lives like a chill wind, but they have not yet laid their claim on us. A young man was lost to a bullet not far from where I write, his parents now neighbors of ghostly sorrow.\n\nThe town, like many, bears the scars of a war fought not with guns but with needles and pills. The opioid plague has taken its due, lives snuffed out by the silent specter of fentanyl. But there are those who fight back, offering salvation in clinics and training sessions, a battle for souls in the guise of education and care.\n\nAnd still, life persists in small triumphs. My son, who walks a different path, finds solace in a school that embraces him. The people there, from the principal to the teachers, they nurture a community where no child is made to feel alone. The town's heart beats strongest in these small acts of kindness and provision, where no child is left hungry or shamed for lack of means.\n\nThe town council has set its sights on renewal, paving roads and planting new life in parks, though their gaze seldom falls on the east, where the old roads bear witness to neglect. It stirs a quiet discontent among us, those who call this side home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town is where I choose to be. It holds a strange beauty, the people warm, the schools safe. The shops provide what's needed, and our home, though modest, holds a comfort that can't be measured in dollars. Sixteen years have passed since we first put down roots here, and the thought of leaving is as foreign as a distant land.",
            "In the old neighborhood there's a place where time seems to linger like the fog atop the hill. Buildings with histories etched in their bones stand watch, silent sentinels of a bygone era. My home is a seven-story edifice across the street from an ancient theater, its marquee long darkened. Down the hill a piece there's a place where people gather, an arcade bar, alive with the hum of summer's warmth, and the people, they come in droves when the nights stretch long and the air is like a balm. In June and July the line stretches down the block, a testament to the pull of light and laughter.\n\nUp the way a few blocks lies the park, a vast expanse given the confines of the city. Encased in concrete with great stone steps hewn with purpose. In winter's grip, the homeless stake their claims, erecting shelters in rows along the sidewalks and those steps. The snow, it seldom falls, but the rain comes with a vengeance, and it seeps into the very marrow of the bone. Their tents, clustered close, offer warmth to those who choose the city over the wild. For them, the family center, a place where the dignity of a shower is within reach, stands just a few blocks further.\n\nThe city's beauty is not lost on me, the architecture a testament to human endeavor, but it is the pulse of the people that draws me in. Hilltop, a name that once whispered fear in the hearts of those who heard it, tales of violence and the sweep of federal brooms trying to cleanse it. Yet the stories linger, passed down like heirlooms, and the memory of those days still hangs in the air. The people here, they labor under the weight of history, striving to keep the streets clean, to hold onto a sense of pride. Whispers persist, warnings not to walk these streets after dark, but I find them echoes of a time past, shadows cast by the light of fear and ignorance.\n\nPerhaps the Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the scars that mark this nation. For all its claims of being a melting pot, the city bears the stains of division, ignorance festering beneath the surface. Yet here, in this place I call home, there's a certain aliveness in the night air, a sense of belonging. I've walked these streets and found kindness in unexpected places, a jacket offered against the chill, a laundromat open late for a moment of respite. I've sat in the rain, believing myself unseen, only to be met with a gaze that said otherwise, a hand that offered a gift and a word of affirmation. In Hilltop, I find the threads of humanity woven tight, a tapestry of lives intermingled, and in that, there is a beauty all its own.",
            "I come to this place when the world was still young to me, just before the eighth grade, and the echoes of its streets were unfamiliar. At first, the solitude was a companion, a whisper in the shadowed alleys of my mind, but in time I found solace in the company of a boy two doors down and another who walked the same stretch of road. They are gone now, but their ghosts linger in the quietude of memory. The neighborhood, a tapestry of American suburbia, remains with its two-story houses standing like sentinels under the indifferent sky. Weekends, when warmth spills over the earth, children’s laughter threads the air like a hymn, but most days silence reigns. The people here, they leave you be unless you call upon them. Trust is woven into the very fabric of the place, unspoken yet steadfast. Not once has my porch been robbed of its parcels, and this speaks to something deeper than mere words. A stone's throw away lies a park, a repository of my youthful endeavors. Basketball, football, baseball—the games we played beneath the sun's watchful gaze. It holds the shadow of pain too, the sharp memory of a broken nose, yet the light outweighs the dark. Now, I walk there with my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to the past as they swing and slide with abandon. Nostalgia, a gentle specter, walks beside me. Diversity colors this neighborhood in myriad shades. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy beckon. Fast food reigns supreme, as is the way of suburbia, and pizza places dot the landscape. The stores, they are filled with everything a soul might seek. Dry cleaners aplenty, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the Jewel-Osco that anchors the street, its name a familiar song in the Midwest. Even here, diversity whispers its presence with an Indian-owned store for those who crave the taste of home. In all, this place is a balm to the tales of discord and discontent that echo from the screens of social media. For this, I am grateful.",
            "The neighborhood rose up around the college like some old sentinel, watchful and weary. Apartments stood like sentinels themselves, blocks of stone and brick, whispering the secrets of the many who have passed through their halls. A smattering of restaurants and bars, their lights flickering like phantoms in the night, offered solace to weary souls. One bar got itself a new name, a fresh coat of paint, and with it, a price that spoke of aspirations above its station, though the spirits within were no less potent for the change. The folks here, they are mostly youth with the fire of future dreams burning bright, or those who scrape by, the cost of living a cruel arbiter. The streets ring with the laughter of children, a school just a stone’s throw away, its walls echoing with the promise and potential of youth.\n\nI share walls with neighbors I do not know, nor care to. Their smoke seeps through the walls, mingling with the air of my abode, so much so that management saw fit to place a mask of fragrance by their door. My partner and I, we chuckled at the absurdity of it. Insulting? Perhaps, and yet here we are. The buildings around me bear the mark of age, their facades worn and weary, yet inside, some hold a surprise of modernity. Down the road, in contrast, are the new pretenders, apartments gleaming with promise but built on foundations of deceit. Their allure is but a façade, yet they stand near the heart of learning, their cost justified by proximity rather than quality.\n\nThere’s a diner nearby, a place where sustenance is served on paper, with the hum of microwaves a constant chorus. Across from it stands a gas station, a place of toil that bears its own stories of hardship. Yet, the city paid its due, and the roads were made anew, ribbons of concrete bordered by green, a touch of civility amidst the urban sprawl. My dwelling is enfolded in trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving their stumps as silent witnesses. Beyond the tree line, more apartments rise, and further still lies 43rd street, a place where neglect has taken root. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings worn, and the trees stand as veils to what lies beneath. Crime finds its den there, though it is not alone in its claim.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, I find contentment in my abode. It stands within reach of the university, a beacon of knowledge a mere walk away. Two bus stops lie at my feet, paths to the wider world, to stores and the heart of the city. In this place, I find a balance of necessity and convenience, a life tethered to a place I can call home.",
            "In a small enclave of duplexes, the cul-de-sac lay like a forgotten relic of another time. The houses, though intended to stand alone, bore the uniformity of their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, each a mirror of the next and yet distinct in the way they absorbed the sun and shadow. There was a camaraderie among the inhabitants, a quiet understanding forged in the simple act of gathering at the end of an undecided driveway. Evenings found us there, where children played with toys and chalk and kites under a sky vast and indifferent, and the world seemed less burdened by the machinations of modern life.\n\nThe landscape stretched out in fields and trees, an expanse softened by the blue of the heavens and the drifting clouds. But this season brought with it a portentous air, the promise of storms brewing in the distance. The sirens wailed their mournful warning, a sound not yet familiar but soon to be, and so we sought shelter. In the bathtub, clutching the smallest dog like a talisman, I hunkered down with my purse and a few pillows. The big dog, obstinate in his fear, barked at the storm from the living room, his voice rising against the hail that fell like judgment upon the earth. \n\nWhen the storm passed, the road steamed in the wake of the tempest, the hail dissolving upon the hot pavement as if it had never been. The sun broke through clearing skies, and rain fell softly, conjuring a double rainbow that arced over the quiet street. I captured the moment with a camera, a testament to share with friends and kin, a marvel that left us all in awe. An hour passed in silence before life resumed its rhythm, as mothers and children reappeared, drawn outside by the promise of dinner and the fading light. For a newcomer from the North, this place was a balm, its southern drawl a music that I was beginning to love.\n\nThe apartment I called home was like the others, two bedrooms and two baths, yet inside, they varied in space and comfort, a mystery among many. Behind the dwellings lay a great field, inviting me to wander to the edge of the pond, a place not meant for swimming. In the early hours, the deer moved in silence, and the bullfrog's song resonated across the stillness of morning. It was a sanctuary, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte, where the rooster's crow heralded the dawn and a donkey's bray signaled the coming night. This was my fortune, to have stumbled upon such a place, a small community unto itself, a gem in the rough-hewn fabric of the South.",
            "In the ten long years since I came to this place, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two worth telling. The day I left Riverdale for Stockbridge was a sorrowful one. I cried for the parting of familiar faces and places, and though it stung, my folks believed it was for the best. They wanted something better for me and my sister, a place where a home was more than a roof and a high school was more than a building. So we moved from what some called ghetto to something else entirely. \n\nOver time, I grew accustomed to this new land of ours, found friends and foes in the halls of the school. Yet, I never came to know the neighbors too well, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis too for a spell. They lived right next door, and in their company, I found a semblance of family. I hold dear the memory of attending Mr. Glen’s wedding, or rather his re-marriage, with my folks and sister. It was a day of joy, a glimpse into a future I hope to craft for myself, where the woman beside me lives like a queen. I remember catching the garter but not the flowers, a small whimsy of fate. We danced until the night grew old, and in that dance, I shared a moment with Marsharii, one of Glen’s daughters. She’s gone her way since, and I hope it’s led her to greater things.\n\nThe neighborhood itself sprawls like a maze, though a GPS now guides my ventures through its winding paths. I have wandered far as I dared, often with Kason and Curtis by my side. We spent hours lost in games and laughter, seeking joy wherever it hid. Sometimes, I find peace in the park, where nature’s quiet balm soothes the soul. There, I balance on sticks from the Home Depot and wield my bokken sword, playing at ancient arts. There’s a court for basketball and tennis too, though it’s been years since I’ve played. My father instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend, under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. Those were days of labor and laughter, and the memory of them lingers still.\n\nThere are many memories here, tales of a life lived and moments cherished, but these are the ones that linger in my mind. And I reckon the finest days are still ahead.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town named Johnston, a place unremarkable in the eyes of the world yet bearing the quiet pride of a locale that calls itself the Peach Capital. This is not written on the stones of history but on a weathered sign that greets you at the threshold. The land stretches out, vast and silent, orchards of peach trees standing in solemn rows, cattle wandering the pastures. Houses rise sporadically from the earth, two-story sentinels clad in metal roofs to fend off the relentless summer sun or the more subdued gray shingles. They sit back from the ribbon of road, yielding their fields to the toil of men and the seasons' yield.\n\nAt the heart of the town, there hangs a stoplight, a solitary guardian over the crossroads where the few stores gather. Here, you find sustenance in places like Hong Kong, a humble Chinese eatery kept by one family, or Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger haven. The pizzeria, once a member of this ensemble, has since shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known not for its prescriptions but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses, stands as a relic of small-town commerce. The IGA, a grocery store, holds its ground, though folks often venture to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General, the town's bustling hub, draws the people with its promise of everyday essentials, its doors swinging open to the constant flow of residents.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small venture under the stewardship of a kindly woman, offers not just furnishings but the service of two movers, delivering comforts to scattered homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, a small domain of grooming and care. A doctor and a veterinarian work in small practices, their hands skilled in tending to the ailments of both man and beast, set apart from the town's core.\n\nJohnston Elementary School stands as the lone institution of early learning, sending its children forth to neighboring towns for continued education. Parks are but a dream in progress, a 2.5-acre promise of recreation and respite, a hope to draw more souls to this quiet enclave. The town lacks the diversions of a larger world—no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no sanctuaries of leisure or playgrounds for the young. Yet in its simplicity, there lies a charm, a fleeting existence that might escape the notice of those who pass by, but lingers in the hearts of those who call it home.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee, where the suburbs stretch out like an old quilt, a road runs between two highways bringing a touch more traffic than one might desire. Yet it's a place of quietude, a neighborhood where folks are known and seldom change. The faces are familiar, their habits too, like the sound of rakes in fall or the hum of lawnmowers cutting grass till October's end. \n\nOur house sits at the corner, watching the world pass by. We know the cars and the people, and we mark the strangers like a whisper of wind through the trees. Dogs are walked, children weave their bicycles through the streets, and we too are part of this rhythm, my wife and I, and our two daughters, growing tall in the shadow of the trees. We work from home, and our comings and goings are as known to others as theirs are to us. \n\nThe grill on the back deck smokes with the promise of barbecue, mingling with the scent of burning leaves that heralds the coming of fall. The winters have grown light, more like an extended autumn, and in these days the garage at the back of the house becomes my retreat. There I tinker with my truck, the open doors a window into the life that moves around me. \n\nHolidays pass in quietude, save for the gatherings that bring a scatter of unfamiliar cars. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, they come and go like leaves on the wind. And though the street carries more than its share of travelers, this place is home, a haven of sorts, and if only it were not a through street, it might be near perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert there lies a neighborhood, a place where the land stretches out in a vast expanse of dust and sand and the relentless sun beats down upon the earth. To live here is to know the color of the world is a ceaseless brown, save for the rare green of a lawn that speaks of extravagance and toil. In the days when I first settled here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide across the parched land. Though time has brought new faces and structures, the essence remains unchanged, a city rising slowly from the dust.\n\nThe people of this place are mostly kind, a testament to the spirit of the desert, but like any city, it holds its shadows. My neighbors are the old guard, friendly souls who have seen the desert change and remain steadfast in their ways. The stores here are the familiar chains, offering the staples of life, yet if one seeks the finer things, the journey must extend beyond this enclave.\n\nConstruction is the lifeblood of this place, a testament to the untamed spaces that still await man's ambition. I find a certain unease in this, for I cherish the quiet expanse that surrounds us. My own craft lies in this realm, a maker of walls and ceilings, yet I hold a fondness for the creatures that call this land home. The desert is a place of stark beauty, a fragile ecosystem that harbors life both strange and marvelous. My children, wild as the lizards they chase, delight in the desert's offerings, their laughter mingling with the wind.\n\nAmidst this rugged landscape, there are places to see and things to do. Victorville offers its own brand of allure, a chance to witness the desert's majesty, especially when the San Bernardino County Fair arrives, bringing with it a sense of festivity and wonder. Not far lies Wrightwood, where the mountains stand tall and cloaked in snow, a place for those who seek the thrill of winter’s sport.\n\nFor those drawn to the stories of the land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the keys to the past, with its geological treasures and relics of those who walked this ground before us. Here, the tales of the desert unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dared to make a life in this unforgiving place.",
            "When they ask about my neighborhood, the description that comes forth may seem set apart from the rest. For there are those who speak from the vantage of homeowners, anchored in lives of their own making. Yet mine is a path that diverges a shade. My neighborhood is the college campus upon which I reside, and the souls housed in the dormitory are the kinship I know. The campus that envelopes it all is part of my claim, though it holds a subtler tether.\n\nDespite this oddity, my neighborhood bears the echoes of what is deemed conventional. Like any neighborhood drawn in the mind's eye, mine too holds houses, people, stores, and parks. Let us first turn our gaze to the \"houses\" that make up this place I call home. Before the exploration begins, clarity calls for the kinds of dwellings found here. There are three: the apartments, the real houses, and the dormitory houses. \n\nIn the apartments, where space is shared, you find two to four souls to a room, and four to six rooms claim a floor. These buildings stretch to two floors, harboring twenty lives within their walls. Then come the actual houses, open to those tied to the school. These are two to four-bedroom affairs, often lodgings for alumni. They are scattered few, a testament to their lesser efficiency. Finally, the dormitories rise, where hundreds stake their claim. Here, two share a room, and it is the common abode in my vicinity.\n\nWith the matter of housing laid bare, we turn to the people. My school stands proud in its diversity, and this tapestry is mirrored in my neighborhood's essence. From varied cultures and ages, they gather. Professional staff find homes in the houses, new students in dormitories, and the elder students in apartments. Words fall short of capturing their essence, so we move on to the stores and parks that embellish the land.\n\nThe school, its own self-contained realm, offers a trove of stores and a singular park. The stores blend dining as found in any land, alongside the school's own unique offerings of attire and provisions. Thus, all that one seeks lies within the bounds of this neighborhood. The park stands as a playground for the diverse souls that dwell here, kept pure and safe by the watchful care of its community.",
            "In the place where I live, sidewalks are scarce and the land slopes away like the skin of some great beast. My house perches atop the neighborhood's steepest rise, a humpbacked hill that folks have christened the \"work out hill\" for the way it draws joggers to its incline. Sidewalks are absent, and so the people tread the asphalt path, a road pocked and worn, treacherous in its own right. The wires of telephone and electricity sag overhead, frayed by the elements, a testimony to the bouts of rain and storm that lash the place. Branches fall with regularity, striking down the lines till they bear the look of patchwork. \n\nEvergreens stand tall and indifferent, their green a defiance of the sky’s gray. Yet the people here harbor no love for them, for they are but obstructions to the ocean's expanse. Houses rise on the hill, each tiered higher than the last, their glass facades hungering for the bay’s view. Come sunset, the waters burn with light drawn from some inner fire, the sky awash in orange. More oft than not, though, the clouds drape low, a haze through which sunlight strains to reach. The days are damp, casting a pall of moss upon all it can claim: roofs, cars, railings. Once my own car, left to languish in the drive, grew a coat of green that cost me three hours to scrape away.\n\nChildren are a rarity in these parts, though a school stands but blocks away. The inhabitants are mostly older folk, veterans of life's work, settled into retirement. Their companions are creatures of four legs, dogs that populate lawns and race down streets in spirited chase. Leave open a door or window at your own peril, for they may wander unbidden indoors. I once found one in my parlor, needing to shoo it back out into the world. Rabbits too roam freely, their numbers swelling till the gardeners curse them for the holes they dig and the havoc they wreak. My cats find them sport, thinning their ranks with tireless zeal. Above, the sky belongs to the birds, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting about, while the occasional hawk or eagle dares the crows’ ire.\n\nStores are a distant promise, but down the slope at the waterfront lie eateries where the sea’s bounty is served fresh. The beach is but a thin line, its stones inviting the hand to hurl them into the bay. The bay itself is a narrow thing, the far shore visible even through the mist’s shroud on most days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find if you're set on it. The veins of the city run deep and wide through its streets, public transport threading these pathways with the constancy of a river. The urban sprawl of New York City does not relent here, and in its embrace, you will find Bensonhurst much the same, a hub where cultures intertwine and histories linger in every corner shop and park bench.\n\nThe scent of the Orient wafts through the air, for in recent times, the Asians have come in numbers, staking their claim upon the landscape with markets and laundromats, their signs a testament to a changing world. Each block tells a story of enterprise and migration, where the wares of the East meet the appetites of the West. Imposing supermarkets stand sentinel, their offerings rich and varied, and the price fair enough to draw even the most discerning of patrons. The convenience of it all is undeniable. Four markets, no more than a stone's throw from one another, speak to the abundance that lies at one's feet.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not a monolith, not solely the domain of one people. It is a tapestry woven with threads of many hues, immigrants mingling with the offspring of their dreams, the children of America’s promise. Still, the Asian presence is pronounced, their endeavors dotting the landscape like stars in a night sky.\n\nThe park, freshly renewed, offers respite and play, a place where the young and the restless find their sport. Courts ring with the echoes of games, fields stretch green and wide. In summer's heat, the fountain's spray beckons, a siren's call to laughter and delight. Here, diversity finds its voice, children of every origin finding common ground in the simple joy of play.\n\nBuildings rise in modest stature, co-ops and condominiums, homes for the many who seek shelter here. Mostly, it is the two-family houses that stand, their occupants as varied as the city itself. The people, kind enough in their way, fill the air with the noise of their lives, the music of engines and the symphony of city living. \n\nWhen the sun sets, the city reveals another face. Safety is a relative term, a fragile thing. Shadows move in the night, and caution is a companion one should not abandon. The specter of trouble lingers; I have known it myself, in days past when violence found me unawares. Thieves too, ever opportunistic, ply their trade, absconding with that which is not theirs.\n\nThe streets bear witness to another neglect, the disregard for the law concerning the waste of dogs. A daily presence, it mars the path to the station, an unwelcome reminder of the shortcomings of civic duty. In Bensonhurst, as elsewhere, vigilance is key, lest your soles bear the brunt of another’s disregard.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there lies a whisper of strangeness, a notion tethered to the bones of the city, not unlike a ghost that refuses to abandon its haunt. The phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is scrawled upon the rear of a building that plays many roles—a pizzeria, a tavern, a stage for music, a dim-lit den where the law is more suggestion than rule. It is both a lament for a bygone Portland of the nineties and early aughts, when the city was a secret known only to those within its embrace, and an invitation to those who seek solace in the peculiar. To be called weird here is to be given a badge of honor, a mark of belonging to a tribe that holds the unusual in high regard.\n\nThe city, despite the tide of wealthy newcomers from the southlands and the rising towers of habitation built to house them, retains its oddities. To be weird is not always to be welcoming, yet it allows for the acceptance of that which the world might cast aside. Like any other city, it bears the marks of modernity, the goods from distant shores, the struggles that mirror those of its nation. Portland is a tapestry of the extraordinary and the mundane, woven with threads of yoga mats and vinyl records, suits and startups. To be weird might simply mean to carry all this with a measure of levity.\n\nIn the quarters where I dwell, bright abodes stand in rows, gardens bursting with herbs and blossoms, and the sidewalks are lined with the offerings of free boxes. These are not mere containers but vessels of possibility, often filled with garments and tomes, waiting for the passerby to claim their unexpected fortune. This discovery, this serendipity, is the essence of Portland, though my version of it is but one among a multitude. There are those who eschew the sidewalk's bounty, opting instead for goat yoga—where creatures with hooves share the mat—or the roar of Timbers games.\n\nThe city is a mosaic of passions and pursuits, dreams chased and dreams deferred, often over a pint too many. Shadows linger over Portland, cast by the weight of addiction and the specter of homelessness, ailments of the mind and spirit exacerbated by the relentless rain and brooding skies. The city offers a refuge of sorts, its services a beacon to those adrift, yet they fall short, as do the hearts of its citizens, who oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all, but a reflection of a broader human condition.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, immutable, watchmen of the north. Each dawn they rose to greet the sun and each dusk they bade it farewell. No matter the forgetfulness of man or the distractions of his labor, they endure, unyielding and indifferent to the petty strife of mortal life. In the moments when the world pressed too hard upon me, clawing at my nerves, they called me to witness them. In their silent majesty, I found a balm for my restless spirit, a quiet strength to carry me forward, one footfall after the next. I came here first as a young scholar, drawn to the northern slopes that loomed over the campus like ancient sentinels. True, the university was a place of beauty in its own right, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, its noble trees. Yet, it was the mountains that claimed my heart, their throne unchallenged. The town itself, with its charming cafés that were sanctuaries of caffeine and late-night study, was not without its allure. A short walk or bus ride to the heart of downtown, and one found themselves amidst the faded bricks, steeped in the aura of ages. Here the town shed its suburban skin, revealing a pulse of life akin to the city's urban heart. But the bustle was brief, a few blocks of clamor before the quietude returned, slipping past the library into the hushed streets once more. This juxtaposition, this mingling of worlds, lent the city an air of mystery, a silent invitation to wander and discover. In such a place, memories are woven into the fabric of existence. There were nights spent under the stars, laughing with friends by rusted swings, and mad dashes through crowded streets to catch a film, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, as with all places touched by time, there were shadows too, memories that cut deeper. The ponds, often a mirror for reflection, were also the setting for my darkest hours, a sanctuary for tears shed under the moon's pale light. It was there, in the solitude of night, amid the turtles and the ducks, that I pondered my place in the grand design, grappling with the enigma of being. So I wandered, past the pond, through the park and the quiet houses, until the main street beckoned. As the sun cast its golden glow upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, I realized my path led northward. There they were, steadfast and unchanging. The mountains, vast and timeless, brushed the heavens with their peaks, more enduring than any man-made tower. In their silent presence, I found my resolve, a quiet voice urging me onward, ever onward.",
            "You might pass it by in a moment’s glance, a place unseen and unheeded. A residential quarter tucked behind the commerce of the world, not a place meant for living, or so it seems. But wander past the vacant husk of an old Whole Foods, skirting the hotels that stand like sentinels abandoned save for the bustling of summer kinships, and you will uncover a hidden thrum of life. Streets lined with apartments, stacked close like Russian dolls laid bare and set in their order, a slow unfolding down the lane. The first you find have whispered tales of ill repute, the kind that live in the shadows, but we’ll leave those for another time, for truth can hide beneath the veils of rumor. The ones beside them, and those beyond, hold tales untold, a world apart from the knowing eyes of most. Across from them, a satellite of learning stands, quiet and solemn, where the young trudge in with the morning’s first light, coffee in hand, battling the waking hours. The iron gates groan their welcome as they filter through, the road outside a cacophony of grumbling commuters, the dance of traffic held fast on busier days. The street comes to halt at another, where a park stretches out, and a center for healing those whose bones have met misfortune. There, porch chairs sit in the sun, a ceiling fan lazily stirring the heavy summer air. Children flit across the park’s expanse, a blur of life against the green, bees floating languid in the patchwork of flowers by the road. Old souls shuffle along with their dogs, frowning at the youths on their boards, nodding at the clusters of girls whispering their secrets of boys and online fame. Beside the park, in a strip mall, a sushi place offers its wares, a quiet affair, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled close. Here, one could ready their pool, adorn their nails, and feast on hibachi in a single afternoon—a testament to the strip mall’s peculiar charm. There is a place for frozen yogurt too, where the young gather, clutching their chilled confections as they skate and vape in a bid for coolness. This neighborhood is a quiet echo of Americana, a slow-moving river of time where change comes with great reluctance, if at all.",
            "In the quiet sprawl of my neighborhood, there lies an old story stitched into the very earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved in two yet joined like a pair of weary twins. My own home, it sits with a modest yard before it and a narrow driveway to the side, a relic of a time when the dream was more than just a memory flickering on the edge of darkness. Once this dream cradled the soul of a nation, yet now it seems to drift away like smoke on the wind. But here, in this place, it lingers still, a whisper to those who will listen, a promise that has not yet faded entirely. The people, though, wear the years heavily, their hope not as bright as it once was. The little yards no longer tended with the care they once knew. Yet cars idle in the driveways, and the children play as if this world were all they would ever need, their laughter the pulse of the street. The school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a bastion of futures yet to be and memories long past. Churches are sparse, their pews empty, but the courts echo with the beat of basketballs. These homes, different to the eye, share a sameness in their bones. There is a supermarket, grandly named Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, while most who walk these streets are African American. The roads are broad, and the children play football, pausing only to let the cars pass in their slow procession. Many here can speak of days gone by when all knew each other by name. Once there was a karate school, but the dreams of being a karate kid faded with the films, and now it is a pharmacy, for in these times, medicine is the balm for all ills, or so it is said. A small theater remains, showing old reels to the delight of elders, an escape from the young who crave the new. An expressway cuts through the land, but its exits lie elsewhere, a decision fought over, the young in favor, the old against, fearing the change it might bring. Now a new high school rises, and we ponder a mascot fitting for our town. Perhaps a cyborg with a southern drawl and a log cabin at its heart would do us justice, a blend of the old and the new, as we are.",
            "In the sprawl of the great city, where the streets snake and twist like old riverbeds carved through stone, the neighborhood stands in its manifold diversity. Between the looming edifices of commerce, there lay scattered domiciles, each nestled in its own peculiar corner. The businesses rise like sentinels, offices and stores and eateries, a panoply of trade and sustenance. There is no famine of new taverns to patronize, nor shops to wander through. Some of these are grand emporiums, the offspring of distant corporate giants, yet among them, small boutiques flourish, their presence a testament to the city's eclectic soul. They line the streets like sentries, their windows reflecting the quietude of nearby residences, which might remain tranquil were it not for the clamor of the city's heartbeat. Parks, green and solemn, offer respite amidst the chaos, where families gather, children laughing in the sun's embrace.\n\nThe people, too, are a tapestry of life woven from threads of countless origins. There in a single breath of space, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice, the Orthodox Jews uphold their ancient rites, and refugees from lands once bound by the Soviet yoke seek new beginnings. Beyond this enclave, the city unfurls further, revealing enclaves named for distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet mere miles apart. But in this city, a mile can stretch long as a lifetime, the roads choked with the ceaseless tide of vehicles, a pilgrimage of metal and exhaust. Few choose to walk, for the city is vast and implacable, and the foot is slow. Thus the roads become rivers of steel, parking a mirage ever just out of reach.\n\nDespite it all, the city's allure draws newcomers, and with them the rising towers of construction, a skyline ever-changing. The prospect of yet more souls and their chariots stirs discontent among the settled. But the diversity of dwellings remains—houses of every shape and size, apartments and condominiums, single-family abodes, and duplexes—all testament to the city's varied heart. In the midst of it, the community, a mosaic of ages and faces, is not as it once was. The bonds that held neighbor to neighbor have loosened, memories of childhood games in the sun now shadows of the past, when the streets were alive with the voices of youth.",
            "She looked out at the endless stretch of cornfields, a horizon unbroken save for the occasional silo, and asked, Where is everything? And I told her, This is it. Her eyes wide with the wonder of it. She came from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw from her door, and never had she beheld such expanse. I spoke to her of growing up in the wide plains of rural Ohio, and in that sharing, she understood a piece of me, the place that shaped me.  \n\nWe traveled the narrow ribbon of road that wound its way through the land, past a quarry filled with still water, and came upon my small settlement. The houses stood, mostly brick and stucco, each cradled by the earth with a half-acre of land for its own. Folks took pride in the care of that land, tending to it as if it were kin. Spring would come, and with it, the flowers, planted anew each year, and the trees that spoke of the seasons' change.  \n\nIn the driveways rested the polished chariots, gleaming under the midday sun, Mercedes Benz, the pride of their owners. As we continued, my grey stucco home came into view, and there was my neighbor, the Korean man with the kind eyes, always outside with a nod and a smile. He'd spend his days with mower and song, and his joy became the music of the place. Age had softened him some, but in his past, he was a healer, a doctor, though now he seemed a part of the earth itself.  \n\nWe reached my home, where the geese wandered the side yard, taunted by our Terrier. Behind, a small stream whispered its way to the quarry, the bullfrogs sang their chorus, and the distant cows lent their voices to the day. Across a simple wooden bridge lay an untouched world, a sanctuary of wild growth, herbs and flowers untamed.  \n\nHere was the heart of my childhood, where forts were built in trees and the chase of critters was my hunt. Always there was something to be done, a companion to be found in one of the neighborhood children. Winters came with their own harsh beauty, the green fields turned to a stark, barren land. Snow, when it blessed us, transformed all into a wonderland. My sister and I would fashion angels in the drifts and build men of snow. We fought, as siblings do, our snowballs the ammunition of youth.  \n\nIn our snowbound fortress, we played our games, a world of pretend where nothing else existed, just two children amid the silence of the winter, the world beyond forgotten."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, there lies a small town in Michigan, where fields stretch out to touch quaint tourist hamlets. There are no sprawling malls nor the bright lights of Wal-mart or Target, not even the hum of an Applebee's. To reach anywhere, one must drive, yet this place stands among the most beautiful in the world, cradled by water on all sides. My town is flanked by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever your feet may wander, a beach waits to welcome them. \n\nThe neighborhood is a testament to small-town life. Houses breathe with space between them, not the uniform sameness of modern developments. Some are relics, lovingly restored, while others bear the marks of age. Most have full basements visible from the street. Time has clad many in aluminum siding, and each home stands painted in a spectrum that defies imagination. Yards stretch out with their own stories, trampolines and playsets dot the landscape. Gardens grow, and fences keep watch over their charges. These homes speak of Middle America, of those who toil and labor, raising families or having seen them grow and leave.\n\nOn any day, the streets are alive with children, their laughter echoing. Dogs trot beside their owners, bicycles whir past, and rollerblades skim the pavement. Neighbors nod in recognition, a quiet understanding of who belongs and who does not. The scent of grilling drifts by, a wave exchanged between strangers who are not quite strangers. Lawns lie neat, leaves banished with the passing of fall. Grass grows green and the plants are neatly trimmed. It is not a place of grandeur but one of substance, where you sense the goodness of raising a family. Quiet, peaceful, safe—a sanctuary in its own right.\n\nWithin walking distance, the county sheriff's department stands guard, the health department by its side. Down the road, the city recycling center serves its people. Nearby, the crack of bats and the call of names echo from the fields, where baseball and softball games unfold. A small airport hums at the edge, planes taking off and landing, their rhythms a part of the town's pulse. Ice cream can be found with a short walk, and downtown is but a stretch of the legs away. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks distant. It is, indeed, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I abide could be likened to the endless rows of houses that stretch in ordered lines like soldiers on parade, each indistinguishable from the next. In this enclave, the hand of the homeowner's association is evident, their presence as palpable as the asphalt underfoot. As you cross the threshold, your eyes are met with the sight of homes cared for with a meticulousness that speaks of the association's watchful eye. Each yard a mirror to its neighbor, patches of manicured grass bordered by pebbles, driveways short and squat, trees that stand not much taller than a man grown. Garages built for two stand sentinel beside each home. As you wind your way through these streets, the concrete before you is smooth, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. Here, the roads are kept as if new, a testament to the many families who call this place home, yet not one pothole mars the surface. The houses, mostly one story, but for the occasional two, rise like the modest dreams of their builders. The post is not delivered to the door as one might expect, but rather to a communal gathering of metal boxes at the street's end, each with its own key, that grants access to letters and parcels alike. Again, the association's preference for orderliness is to thank.  \n\nSituated at the city's far-flung edge, where suburb meets the till of country soil, there is room enough for all manner of things. Pools, clear and well-kept, lie behind their fences, open to all who dwell within. Paths wind through the land, inviting the solitary walker or the company of a dog. Here, exercise does not demand a park; the neighborhood's breadth is its own track. Retirees form the backbone of this place, their presence lending a sense of security and watchfulness. Yet among them are those younger, professionals still in the midst of their working years. The city beyond, though populous, retains the heart of a small town. It offers what one might need, including a solitary mall, sufficient in its humble way. The journey to the city's heart takes but a quarter of an hour, where stores of all kinds await, from the organic to the frugal, each serving its purpose in the tapestry of commerce. This neighborhood, in its quiet and well-tended way, embodies the spirit of safety and care. While not nestled among the shops, a short drive opens the world of commerce to one's choosing.",
            "It was the first I'd heard of the place, the tale of it come to me while listening to a podcast about folks vanished into thin air. That took me aback some. Seemed every flat in them parts was priced through the roof, over a thousand a month. Strange thing was, neither I nor my friends had caught wind of such a story. Maybe it’s the struggle, I reckon. Some nights, I know, there are those among us who find sleep only through tears. Life ain't cheap, but we've learned the art of making do. You come to find a fondness for the musty scent of flea market trinkets and clothes long sealed in camphor. Life smells less when you're grown. Perhaps you take up smoking, or maybe you just grow too used to the way of things. Yet the flea market, it never fails to make its presence known. The scent of adulthood is like old magazines piled atop a shut piano. It settles into the leather and lingers even after a good scrub. Round here, you’ve got three thrift stores within a stroll. From one end, you can make the rounds to a couple of charity shops, a library, a rare book nook, and a curio emporium. Downtown is a crush, cars and folks filling the streets each dawn, yet inside the thrifts, it’s hushed. No matter the throng outside, the shop holds its silence. A fine spot to lose the hours of a day. And every year, there are more of those. Cars and people surging through. They call it a burgeoning city. Headquarters to one of the largest online empires for trade and delivery, it's still finding its legs. Brings to mind New York, where everyone chases their own stars, asking little of you. Here, solitude and silence are your own, and they grant you that. Not like the South, where a touch of concern means you care. No prying into lives here, truly. You can keep your guard up as long as you see fit, and the city will go on crashing and receding like waves on the shore. It's a place alive with life. Between the pianist next door and the two aspiring singers above, there’s always some manner of song. In some ways, it feels less like a flat of strangers and more a fellowship of kin. We gather for our needs, mark birthdays, grieve our losses, lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be among them. I find a liking in most of my neighbors, and they seem to treat me kindly in turn. I mind my mess and share my food, and they return the favor. I fetch their mail and they mine. It gladdens me to see them, and I dare say they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I dwell in this sprawling, unfeeling modernity, but it's folk like my neighbors what make me feel I ain't completely botched my life.",
            "In a place where the flat lands stretch out beneath the big sky, I make my home. It's a small town in the Midwest, clinging to the edges of a city that looms with its glass and steel. This town, or at least the part where I reside, has seen better days. On the eastern edge, where the sun rises over tired houses, the economy has cast its shadow long and cold. The houses there are humble, some worn with the years, others held together by the dreams of those who barely own them.\n\nYet it is not a place without its charms. The folks here, they nod and smile as you pass by, a silent fellowship bound by shared circumstance. The streets whisper of events that have come and gone, the kind that leave a mark. Crimes have brushed past our lives like a chill wind, but they have not yet laid their claim on us. A young man was lost to a bullet not far from where I write, his parents now neighbors of ghostly sorrow.\n\nThe town, like many, bears the scars of a war fought not with guns but with needles and pills. The opioid plague has taken its due, lives snuffed out by the silent specter of fentanyl. But there are those who fight back, offering salvation in clinics and training sessions, a battle for souls in the guise of education and care.\n\nAnd still, life persists in small triumphs. My son, who walks a different path, finds solace in a school that embraces him. The people there, from the principal to the teachers, they nurture a community where no child is made to feel alone. The town's heart beats strongest in these small acts of kindness and provision, where no child is left hungry or shamed for lack of means.\n\nThe town council has set its sights on renewal, paving roads and planting new life in parks, though their gaze seldom falls on the east, where the old roads bear witness to neglect. It stirs a quiet discontent among us, those who call this side home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town is where I choose to be. It holds a strange beauty, the people warm, the schools safe. The shops provide what's needed, and our home, though modest, holds a comfort that can't be measured in dollars. Sixteen years have passed since we first put down roots here, and the thought of leaving is as foreign as a distant land.",
            "In the old neighborhood there's a place where time seems to linger like the fog atop the hill. Buildings with histories etched in their bones stand watch, silent sentinels of a bygone era. My home is a seven-story edifice across the street from an ancient theater, its marquee long darkened. Down the hill a piece there's a place where people gather, an arcade bar, alive with the hum of summer's warmth, and the people, they come in droves when the nights stretch long and the air is like a balm. In June and July the line stretches down the block, a testament to the pull of light and laughter.\n\nUp the way a few blocks lies the park, a vast expanse given the confines of the city. Encased in concrete with great stone steps hewn with purpose. In winter's grip, the homeless stake their claims, erecting shelters in rows along the sidewalks and those steps. The snow, it seldom falls, but the rain comes with a vengeance, and it seeps into the very marrow of the bone. Their tents, clustered close, offer warmth to those who choose the city over the wild. For them, the family center, a place where the dignity of a shower is within reach, stands just a few blocks further.\n\nThe city's beauty is not lost on me, the architecture a testament to human endeavor, but it is the pulse of the people that draws me in. Hilltop, a name that once whispered fear in the hearts of those who heard it, tales of violence and the sweep of federal brooms trying to cleanse it. Yet the stories linger, passed down like heirlooms, and the memory of those days still hangs in the air. The people here, they labor under the weight of history, striving to keep the streets clean, to hold onto a sense of pride. Whispers persist, warnings not to walk these streets after dark, but I find them echoes of a time past, shadows cast by the light of fear and ignorance.\n\nPerhaps the Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the scars that mark this nation. For all its claims of being a melting pot, the city bears the stains of division, ignorance festering beneath the surface. Yet here, in this place I call home, there's a certain aliveness in the night air, a sense of belonging. I've walked these streets and found kindness in unexpected places, a jacket offered against the chill, a laundromat open late for a moment of respite. I've sat in the rain, believing myself unseen, only to be met with a gaze that said otherwise, a hand that offered a gift and a word of affirmation. In Hilltop, I find the threads of humanity woven tight, a tapestry of lives intermingled, and in that, there is a beauty all its own.",
            "I come to this place when the world was still young to me, just before the eighth grade, and the echoes of its streets were unfamiliar. At first, the solitude was a companion, a whisper in the shadowed alleys of my mind, but in time I found solace in the company of a boy two doors down and another who walked the same stretch of road. They are gone now, but their ghosts linger in the quietude of memory. The neighborhood, a tapestry of American suburbia, remains with its two-story houses standing like sentinels under the indifferent sky. Weekends, when warmth spills over the earth, children’s laughter threads the air like a hymn, but most days silence reigns. The people here, they leave you be unless you call upon them. Trust is woven into the very fabric of the place, unspoken yet steadfast. Not once has my porch been robbed of its parcels, and this speaks to something deeper than mere words. A stone's throw away lies a park, a repository of my youthful endeavors. Basketball, football, baseball—the games we played beneath the sun's watchful gaze. It holds the shadow of pain too, the sharp memory of a broken nose, yet the light outweighs the dark. Now, I walk there with my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to the past as they swing and slide with abandon. Nostalgia, a gentle specter, walks beside me. Diversity colors this neighborhood in myriad shades. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy beckon. Fast food reigns supreme, as is the way of suburbia, and pizza places dot the landscape. The stores, they are filled with everything a soul might seek. Dry cleaners aplenty, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the Jewel-Osco that anchors the street, its name a familiar song in the Midwest. Even here, diversity whispers its presence with an Indian-owned store for those who crave the taste of home. In all, this place is a balm to the tales of discord and discontent that echo from the screens of social media. For this, I am grateful.",
            "The neighborhood rose up around the college like some old sentinel, watchful and weary. Apartments stood like sentinels themselves, blocks of stone and brick, whispering the secrets of the many who have passed through their halls. A smattering of restaurants and bars, their lights flickering like phantoms in the night, offered solace to weary souls. One bar got itself a new name, a fresh coat of paint, and with it, a price that spoke of aspirations above its station, though the spirits within were no less potent for the change. The folks here, they are mostly youth with the fire of future dreams burning bright, or those who scrape by, the cost of living a cruel arbiter. The streets ring with the laughter of children, a school just a stone’s throw away, its walls echoing with the promise and potential of youth.\n\nI share walls with neighbors I do not know, nor care to. Their smoke seeps through the walls, mingling with the air of my abode, so much so that management saw fit to place a mask of fragrance by their door. My partner and I, we chuckled at the absurdity of it. Insulting? Perhaps, and yet here we are. The buildings around me bear the mark of age, their facades worn and weary, yet inside, some hold a surprise of modernity. Down the road, in contrast, are the new pretenders, apartments gleaming with promise but built on foundations of deceit. Their allure is but a façade, yet they stand near the heart of learning, their cost justified by proximity rather than quality.\n\nThere’s a diner nearby, a place where sustenance is served on paper, with the hum of microwaves a constant chorus. Across from it stands a gas station, a place of toil that bears its own stories of hardship. Yet, the city paid its due, and the roads were made anew, ribbons of concrete bordered by green, a touch of civility amidst the urban sprawl. My dwelling is enfolded in trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving their stumps as silent witnesses. Beyond the tree line, more apartments rise, and further still lies 43rd street, a place where neglect has taken root. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings worn, and the trees stand as veils to what lies beneath. Crime finds its den there, though it is not alone in its claim.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, I find contentment in my abode. It stands within reach of the university, a beacon of knowledge a mere walk away. Two bus stops lie at my feet, paths to the wider world, to stores and the heart of the city. In this place, I find a balance of necessity and convenience, a life tethered to a place I can call home.",
            "In a small enclave of duplexes, the cul-de-sac lay like a forgotten relic of another time. The houses, though intended to stand alone, bore the uniformity of their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, each a mirror of the next and yet distinct in the way they absorbed the sun and shadow. There was a camaraderie among the inhabitants, a quiet understanding forged in the simple act of gathering at the end of an undecided driveway. Evenings found us there, where children played with toys and chalk and kites under a sky vast and indifferent, and the world seemed less burdened by the machinations of modern life.\n\nThe landscape stretched out in fields and trees, an expanse softened by the blue of the heavens and the drifting clouds. But this season brought with it a portentous air, the promise of storms brewing in the distance. The sirens wailed their mournful warning, a sound not yet familiar but soon to be, and so we sought shelter. In the bathtub, clutching the smallest dog like a talisman, I hunkered down with my purse and a few pillows. The big dog, obstinate in his fear, barked at the storm from the living room, his voice rising against the hail that fell like judgment upon the earth. \n\nWhen the storm passed, the road steamed in the wake of the tempest, the hail dissolving upon the hot pavement as if it had never been. The sun broke through clearing skies, and rain fell softly, conjuring a double rainbow that arced over the quiet street. I captured the moment with a camera, a testament to share with friends and kin, a marvel that left us all in awe. An hour passed in silence before life resumed its rhythm, as mothers and children reappeared, drawn outside by the promise of dinner and the fading light. For a newcomer from the North, this place was a balm, its southern drawl a music that I was beginning to love.\n\nThe apartment I called home was like the others, two bedrooms and two baths, yet inside, they varied in space and comfort, a mystery among many. Behind the dwellings lay a great field, inviting me to wander to the edge of the pond, a place not meant for swimming. In the early hours, the deer moved in silence, and the bullfrog's song resonated across the stillness of morning. It was a sanctuary, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte, where the rooster's crow heralded the dawn and a donkey's bray signaled the coming night. This was my fortune, to have stumbled upon such a place, a small community unto itself, a gem in the rough-hewn fabric of the South.",
            "In the ten long years since I came to this place, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two worth telling. The day I left Riverdale for Stockbridge was a sorrowful one. I cried for the parting of familiar faces and places, and though it stung, my folks believed it was for the best. They wanted something better for me and my sister, a place where a home was more than a roof and a high school was more than a building. So we moved from what some called ghetto to something else entirely. \n\nOver time, I grew accustomed to this new land of ours, found friends and foes in the halls of the school. Yet, I never came to know the neighbors too well, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis too for a spell. They lived right next door, and in their company, I found a semblance of family. I hold dear the memory of attending Mr. Glen’s wedding, or rather his re-marriage, with my folks and sister. It was a day of joy, a glimpse into a future I hope to craft for myself, where the woman beside me lives like a queen. I remember catching the garter but not the flowers, a small whimsy of fate. We danced until the night grew old, and in that dance, I shared a moment with Marsharii, one of Glen’s daughters. She’s gone her way since, and I hope it’s led her to greater things.\n\nThe neighborhood itself sprawls like a maze, though a GPS now guides my ventures through its winding paths. I have wandered far as I dared, often with Kason and Curtis by my side. We spent hours lost in games and laughter, seeking joy wherever it hid. Sometimes, I find peace in the park, where nature’s quiet balm soothes the soul. There, I balance on sticks from the Home Depot and wield my bokken sword, playing at ancient arts. There’s a court for basketball and tennis too, though it’s been years since I’ve played. My father instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend, under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. Those were days of labor and laughter, and the memory of them lingers still.\n\nThere are many memories here, tales of a life lived and moments cherished, but these are the ones that linger in my mind. And I reckon the finest days are still ahead.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town named Johnston, a place unremarkable in the eyes of the world yet bearing the quiet pride of a locale that calls itself the Peach Capital. This is not written on the stones of history but on a weathered sign that greets you at the threshold. The land stretches out, vast and silent, orchards of peach trees standing in solemn rows, cattle wandering the pastures. Houses rise sporadically from the earth, two-story sentinels clad in metal roofs to fend off the relentless summer sun or the more subdued gray shingles. They sit back from the ribbon of road, yielding their fields to the toil of men and the seasons' yield.\n\nAt the heart of the town, there hangs a stoplight, a solitary guardian over the crossroads where the few stores gather. Here, you find sustenance in places like Hong Kong, a humble Chinese eatery kept by one family, or Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger haven. The pizzeria, once a member of this ensemble, has since shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known not for its prescriptions but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses, stands as a relic of small-town commerce. The IGA, a grocery store, holds its ground, though folks often venture to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General, the town's bustling hub, draws the people with its promise of everyday essentials, its doors swinging open to the constant flow of residents.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small venture under the stewardship of a kindly woman, offers not just furnishings but the service of two movers, delivering comforts to scattered homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, a small domain of grooming and care. A doctor and a veterinarian work in small practices, their hands skilled in tending to the ailments of both man and beast, set apart from the town's core.\n\nJohnston Elementary School stands as the lone institution of early learning, sending its children forth to neighboring towns for continued education. Parks are but a dream in progress, a 2.5-acre promise of recreation and respite, a hope to draw more souls to this quiet enclave. The town lacks the diversions of a larger world—no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no sanctuaries of leisure or playgrounds for the young. Yet in its simplicity, there lies a charm, a fleeting existence that might escape the notice of those who pass by, but lingers in the hearts of those who call it home.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee, where the suburbs stretch out like an old quilt, a road runs between two highways bringing a touch more traffic than one might desire. Yet it's a place of quietude, a neighborhood where folks are known and seldom change. The faces are familiar, their habits too, like the sound of rakes in fall or the hum of lawnmowers cutting grass till October's end. \n\nOur house sits at the corner, watching the world pass by. We know the cars and the people, and we mark the strangers like a whisper of wind through the trees. Dogs are walked, children weave their bicycles through the streets, and we too are part of this rhythm, my wife and I, and our two daughters, growing tall in the shadow of the trees. We work from home, and our comings and goings are as known to others as theirs are to us. \n\nThe grill on the back deck smokes with the promise of barbecue, mingling with the scent of burning leaves that heralds the coming of fall. The winters have grown light, more like an extended autumn, and in these days the garage at the back of the house becomes my retreat. There I tinker with my truck, the open doors a window into the life that moves around me. \n\nHolidays pass in quietude, save for the gatherings that bring a scatter of unfamiliar cars. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, they come and go like leaves on the wind. And though the street carries more than its share of travelers, this place is home, a haven of sorts, and if only it were not a through street, it might be near perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert there lies a neighborhood, a place where the land stretches out in a vast expanse of dust and sand and the relentless sun beats down upon the earth. To live here is to know the color of the world is a ceaseless brown, save for the rare green of a lawn that speaks of extravagance and toil. In the days when I first settled here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide across the parched land. Though time has brought new faces and structures, the essence remains unchanged, a city rising slowly from the dust.\n\nThe people of this place are mostly kind, a testament to the spirit of the desert, but like any city, it holds its shadows. My neighbors are the old guard, friendly souls who have seen the desert change and remain steadfast in their ways. The stores here are the familiar chains, offering the staples of life, yet if one seeks the finer things, the journey must extend beyond this enclave.\n\nConstruction is the lifeblood of this place, a testament to the untamed spaces that still await man's ambition. I find a certain unease in this, for I cherish the quiet expanse that surrounds us. My own craft lies in this realm, a maker of walls and ceilings, yet I hold a fondness for the creatures that call this land home. The desert is a place of stark beauty, a fragile ecosystem that harbors life both strange and marvelous. My children, wild as the lizards they chase, delight in the desert's offerings, their laughter mingling with the wind.\n\nAmidst this rugged landscape, there are places to see and things to do. Victorville offers its own brand of allure, a chance to witness the desert's majesty, especially when the San Bernardino County Fair arrives, bringing with it a sense of festivity and wonder. Not far lies Wrightwood, where the mountains stand tall and cloaked in snow, a place for those who seek the thrill of winter’s sport.\n\nFor those drawn to the stories of the land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the keys to the past, with its geological treasures and relics of those who walked this ground before us. Here, the tales of the desert unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dared to make a life in this unforgiving place.",
            "When they ask about my neighborhood, the description that comes forth may seem set apart from the rest. For there are those who speak from the vantage of homeowners, anchored in lives of their own making. Yet mine is a path that diverges a shade. My neighborhood is the college campus upon which I reside, and the souls housed in the dormitory are the kinship I know. The campus that envelopes it all is part of my claim, though it holds a subtler tether.\n\nDespite this oddity, my neighborhood bears the echoes of what is deemed conventional. Like any neighborhood drawn in the mind's eye, mine too holds houses, people, stores, and parks. Let us first turn our gaze to the \"houses\" that make up this place I call home. Before the exploration begins, clarity calls for the kinds of dwellings found here. There are three: the apartments, the real houses, and the dormitory houses. \n\nIn the apartments, where space is shared, you find two to four souls to a room, and four to six rooms claim a floor. These buildings stretch to two floors, harboring twenty lives within their walls. Then come the actual houses, open to those tied to the school. These are two to four-bedroom affairs, often lodgings for alumni. They are scattered few, a testament to their lesser efficiency. Finally, the dormitories rise, where hundreds stake their claim. Here, two share a room, and it is the common abode in my vicinity.\n\nWith the matter of housing laid bare, we turn to the people. My school stands proud in its diversity, and this tapestry is mirrored in my neighborhood's essence. From varied cultures and ages, they gather. Professional staff find homes in the houses, new students in dormitories, and the elder students in apartments. Words fall short of capturing their essence, so we move on to the stores and parks that embellish the land.\n\nThe school, its own self-contained realm, offers a trove of stores and a singular park. The stores blend dining as found in any land, alongside the school's own unique offerings of attire and provisions. Thus, all that one seeks lies within the bounds of this neighborhood. The park stands as a playground for the diverse souls that dwell here, kept pure and safe by the watchful care of its community.",
            "In the place where I live, sidewalks are scarce and the land slopes away like the skin of some great beast. My house perches atop the neighborhood's steepest rise, a humpbacked hill that folks have christened the \"work out hill\" for the way it draws joggers to its incline. Sidewalks are absent, and so the people tread the asphalt path, a road pocked and worn, treacherous in its own right. The wires of telephone and electricity sag overhead, frayed by the elements, a testimony to the bouts of rain and storm that lash the place. Branches fall with regularity, striking down the lines till they bear the look of patchwork. \n\nEvergreens stand tall and indifferent, their green a defiance of the sky’s gray. Yet the people here harbor no love for them, for they are but obstructions to the ocean's expanse. Houses rise on the hill, each tiered higher than the last, their glass facades hungering for the bay’s view. Come sunset, the waters burn with light drawn from some inner fire, the sky awash in orange. More oft than not, though, the clouds drape low, a haze through which sunlight strains to reach. The days are damp, casting a pall of moss upon all it can claim: roofs, cars, railings. Once my own car, left to languish in the drive, grew a coat of green that cost me three hours to scrape away.\n\nChildren are a rarity in these parts, though a school stands but blocks away. The inhabitants are mostly older folk, veterans of life's work, settled into retirement. Their companions are creatures of four legs, dogs that populate lawns and race down streets in spirited chase. Leave open a door or window at your own peril, for they may wander unbidden indoors. I once found one in my parlor, needing to shoo it back out into the world. Rabbits too roam freely, their numbers swelling till the gardeners curse them for the holes they dig and the havoc they wreak. My cats find them sport, thinning their ranks with tireless zeal. Above, the sky belongs to the birds, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting about, while the occasional hawk or eagle dares the crows’ ire.\n\nStores are a distant promise, but down the slope at the waterfront lie eateries where the sea’s bounty is served fresh. The beach is but a thin line, its stones inviting the hand to hurl them into the bay. The bay itself is a narrow thing, the far shore visible even through the mist’s shroud on most days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find if you're set on it. The veins of the city run deep and wide through its streets, public transport threading these pathways with the constancy of a river. The urban sprawl of New York City does not relent here, and in its embrace, you will find Bensonhurst much the same, a hub where cultures intertwine and histories linger in every corner shop and park bench.\n\nThe scent of the Orient wafts through the air, for in recent times, the Asians have come in numbers, staking their claim upon the landscape with markets and laundromats, their signs a testament to a changing world. Each block tells a story of enterprise and migration, where the wares of the East meet the appetites of the West. Imposing supermarkets stand sentinel, their offerings rich and varied, and the price fair enough to draw even the most discerning of patrons. The convenience of it all is undeniable. Four markets, no more than a stone's throw from one another, speak to the abundance that lies at one's feet.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not a monolith, not solely the domain of one people. It is a tapestry woven with threads of many hues, immigrants mingling with the offspring of their dreams, the children of America’s promise. Still, the Asian presence is pronounced, their endeavors dotting the landscape like stars in a night sky.\n\nThe park, freshly renewed, offers respite and play, a place where the young and the restless find their sport. Courts ring with the echoes of games, fields stretch green and wide. In summer's heat, the fountain's spray beckons, a siren's call to laughter and delight. Here, diversity finds its voice, children of every origin finding common ground in the simple joy of play.\n\nBuildings rise in modest stature, co-ops and condominiums, homes for the many who seek shelter here. Mostly, it is the two-family houses that stand, their occupants as varied as the city itself. The people, kind enough in their way, fill the air with the noise of their lives, the music of engines and the symphony of city living. \n\nWhen the sun sets, the city reveals another face. Safety is a relative term, a fragile thing. Shadows move in the night, and caution is a companion one should not abandon. The specter of trouble lingers; I have known it myself, in days past when violence found me unawares. Thieves too, ever opportunistic, ply their trade, absconding with that which is not theirs.\n\nThe streets bear witness to another neglect, the disregard for the law concerning the waste of dogs. A daily presence, it mars the path to the station, an unwelcome reminder of the shortcomings of civic duty. In Bensonhurst, as elsewhere, vigilance is key, lest your soles bear the brunt of another’s disregard.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there lies a whisper of strangeness, a notion tethered to the bones of the city, not unlike a ghost that refuses to abandon its haunt. The phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is scrawled upon the rear of a building that plays many roles—a pizzeria, a tavern, a stage for music, a dim-lit den where the law is more suggestion than rule. It is both a lament for a bygone Portland of the nineties and early aughts, when the city was a secret known only to those within its embrace, and an invitation to those who seek solace in the peculiar. To be called weird here is to be given a badge of honor, a mark of belonging to a tribe that holds the unusual in high regard.\n\nThe city, despite the tide of wealthy newcomers from the southlands and the rising towers of habitation built to house them, retains its oddities. To be weird is not always to be welcoming, yet it allows for the acceptance of that which the world might cast aside. Like any other city, it bears the marks of modernity, the goods from distant shores, the struggles that mirror those of its nation. Portland is a tapestry of the extraordinary and the mundane, woven with threads of yoga mats and vinyl records, suits and startups. To be weird might simply mean to carry all this with a measure of levity.\n\nIn the quarters where I dwell, bright abodes stand in rows, gardens bursting with herbs and blossoms, and the sidewalks are lined with the offerings of free boxes. These are not mere containers but vessels of possibility, often filled with garments and tomes, waiting for the passerby to claim their unexpected fortune. This discovery, this serendipity, is the essence of Portland, though my version of it is but one among a multitude. There are those who eschew the sidewalk's bounty, opting instead for goat yoga—where creatures with hooves share the mat—or the roar of Timbers games.\n\nThe city is a mosaic of passions and pursuits, dreams chased and dreams deferred, often over a pint too many. Shadows linger over Portland, cast by the weight of addiction and the specter of homelessness, ailments of the mind and spirit exacerbated by the relentless rain and brooding skies. The city offers a refuge of sorts, its services a beacon to those adrift, yet they fall short, as do the hearts of its citizens, who oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all, but a reflection of a broader human condition.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, immutable, watchmen of the north. Each dawn they rose to greet the sun and each dusk they bade it farewell. No matter the forgetfulness of man or the distractions of his labor, they endure, unyielding and indifferent to the petty strife of mortal life. In the moments when the world pressed too hard upon me, clawing at my nerves, they called me to witness them. In their silent majesty, I found a balm for my restless spirit, a quiet strength to carry me forward, one footfall after the next. I came here first as a young scholar, drawn to the northern slopes that loomed over the campus like ancient sentinels. True, the university was a place of beauty in its own right, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, its noble trees. Yet, it was the mountains that claimed my heart, their throne unchallenged. The town itself, with its charming cafés that were sanctuaries of caffeine and late-night study, was not without its allure. A short walk or bus ride to the heart of downtown, and one found themselves amidst the faded bricks, steeped in the aura of ages. Here the town shed its suburban skin, revealing a pulse of life akin to the city's urban heart. But the bustle was brief, a few blocks of clamor before the quietude returned, slipping past the library into the hushed streets once more. This juxtaposition, this mingling of worlds, lent the city an air of mystery, a silent invitation to wander and discover. In such a place, memories are woven into the fabric of existence. There were nights spent under the stars, laughing with friends by rusted swings, and mad dashes through crowded streets to catch a film, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, as with all places touched by time, there were shadows too, memories that cut deeper. The ponds, often a mirror for reflection, were also the setting for my darkest hours, a sanctuary for tears shed under the moon's pale light. It was there, in the solitude of night, amid the turtles and the ducks, that I pondered my place in the grand design, grappling with the enigma of being. So I wandered, past the pond, through the park and the quiet houses, until the main street beckoned. As the sun cast its golden glow upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, I realized my path led northward. There they were, steadfast and unchanging. The mountains, vast and timeless, brushed the heavens with their peaks, more enduring than any man-made tower. In their silent presence, I found my resolve, a quiet voice urging me onward, ever onward.",
            "You might pass it by in a moment’s glance, a place unseen and unheeded. A residential quarter tucked behind the commerce of the world, not a place meant for living, or so it seems. But wander past the vacant husk of an old Whole Foods, skirting the hotels that stand like sentinels abandoned save for the bustling of summer kinships, and you will uncover a hidden thrum of life. Streets lined with apartments, stacked close like Russian dolls laid bare and set in their order, a slow unfolding down the lane. The first you find have whispered tales of ill repute, the kind that live in the shadows, but we’ll leave those for another time, for truth can hide beneath the veils of rumor. The ones beside them, and those beyond, hold tales untold, a world apart from the knowing eyes of most. Across from them, a satellite of learning stands, quiet and solemn, where the young trudge in with the morning’s first light, coffee in hand, battling the waking hours. The iron gates groan their welcome as they filter through, the road outside a cacophony of grumbling commuters, the dance of traffic held fast on busier days. The street comes to halt at another, where a park stretches out, and a center for healing those whose bones have met misfortune. There, porch chairs sit in the sun, a ceiling fan lazily stirring the heavy summer air. Children flit across the park’s expanse, a blur of life against the green, bees floating languid in the patchwork of flowers by the road. Old souls shuffle along with their dogs, frowning at the youths on their boards, nodding at the clusters of girls whispering their secrets of boys and online fame. Beside the park, in a strip mall, a sushi place offers its wares, a quiet affair, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled close. Here, one could ready their pool, adorn their nails, and feast on hibachi in a single afternoon—a testament to the strip mall’s peculiar charm. There is a place for frozen yogurt too, where the young gather, clutching their chilled confections as they skate and vape in a bid for coolness. This neighborhood is a quiet echo of Americana, a slow-moving river of time where change comes with great reluctance, if at all.",
            "In the quiet sprawl of my neighborhood, there lies an old story stitched into the very earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved in two yet joined like a pair of weary twins. My own home, it sits with a modest yard before it and a narrow driveway to the side, a relic of a time when the dream was more than just a memory flickering on the edge of darkness. Once this dream cradled the soul of a nation, yet now it seems to drift away like smoke on the wind. But here, in this place, it lingers still, a whisper to those who will listen, a promise that has not yet faded entirely. The people, though, wear the years heavily, their hope not as bright as it once was. The little yards no longer tended with the care they once knew. Yet cars idle in the driveways, and the children play as if this world were all they would ever need, their laughter the pulse of the street. The school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a bastion of futures yet to be and memories long past. Churches are sparse, their pews empty, but the courts echo with the beat of basketballs. These homes, different to the eye, share a sameness in their bones. There is a supermarket, grandly named Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, while most who walk these streets are African American. The roads are broad, and the children play football, pausing only to let the cars pass in their slow procession. Many here can speak of days gone by when all knew each other by name. Once there was a karate school, but the dreams of being a karate kid faded with the films, and now it is a pharmacy, for in these times, medicine is the balm for all ills, or so it is said. A small theater remains, showing old reels to the delight of elders, an escape from the young who crave the new. An expressway cuts through the land, but its exits lie elsewhere, a decision fought over, the young in favor, the old against, fearing the change it might bring. Now a new high school rises, and we ponder a mascot fitting for our town. Perhaps a cyborg with a southern drawl and a log cabin at its heart would do us justice, a blend of the old and the new, as we are.",
            "In the sprawl of the great city, where the streets snake and twist like old riverbeds carved through stone, the neighborhood stands in its manifold diversity. Between the looming edifices of commerce, there lay scattered domiciles, each nestled in its own peculiar corner. The businesses rise like sentinels, offices and stores and eateries, a panoply of trade and sustenance. There is no famine of new taverns to patronize, nor shops to wander through. Some of these are grand emporiums, the offspring of distant corporate giants, yet among them, small boutiques flourish, their presence a testament to the city's eclectic soul. They line the streets like sentries, their windows reflecting the quietude of nearby residences, which might remain tranquil were it not for the clamor of the city's heartbeat. Parks, green and solemn, offer respite amidst the chaos, where families gather, children laughing in the sun's embrace.\n\nThe people, too, are a tapestry of life woven from threads of countless origins. There in a single breath of space, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice, the Orthodox Jews uphold their ancient rites, and refugees from lands once bound by the Soviet yoke seek new beginnings. Beyond this enclave, the city unfurls further, revealing enclaves named for distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet mere miles apart. But in this city, a mile can stretch long as a lifetime, the roads choked with the ceaseless tide of vehicles, a pilgrimage of metal and exhaust. Few choose to walk, for the city is vast and implacable, and the foot is slow. Thus the roads become rivers of steel, parking a mirage ever just out of reach.\n\nDespite it all, the city's allure draws newcomers, and with them the rising towers of construction, a skyline ever-changing. The prospect of yet more souls and their chariots stirs discontent among the settled. But the diversity of dwellings remains—houses of every shape and size, apartments and condominiums, single-family abodes, and duplexes—all testament to the city's varied heart. In the midst of it, the community, a mosaic of ages and faces, is not as it once was. The bonds that held neighbor to neighbor have loosened, memories of childhood games in the sun now shadows of the past, when the streets were alive with the voices of youth.",
            "She looked out at the endless stretch of cornfields, a horizon unbroken save for the occasional silo, and asked, Where is everything? And I told her, This is it. Her eyes wide with the wonder of it. She came from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw from her door, and never had she beheld such expanse. I spoke to her of growing up in the wide plains of rural Ohio, and in that sharing, she understood a piece of me, the place that shaped me.  \n\nWe traveled the narrow ribbon of road that wound its way through the land, past a quarry filled with still water, and came upon my small settlement. The houses stood, mostly brick and stucco, each cradled by the earth with a half-acre of land for its own. Folks took pride in the care of that land, tending to it as if it were kin. Spring would come, and with it, the flowers, planted anew each year, and the trees that spoke of the seasons' change.  \n\nIn the driveways rested the polished chariots, gleaming under the midday sun, Mercedes Benz, the pride of their owners. As we continued, my grey stucco home came into view, and there was my neighbor, the Korean man with the kind eyes, always outside with a nod and a smile. He'd spend his days with mower and song, and his joy became the music of the place. Age had softened him some, but in his past, he was a healer, a doctor, though now he seemed a part of the earth itself.  \n\nWe reached my home, where the geese wandered the side yard, taunted by our Terrier. Behind, a small stream whispered its way to the quarry, the bullfrogs sang their chorus, and the distant cows lent their voices to the day. Across a simple wooden bridge lay an untouched world, a sanctuary of wild growth, herbs and flowers untamed.  \n\nHere was the heart of my childhood, where forts were built in trees and the chase of critters was my hunt. Always there was something to be done, a companion to be found in one of the neighborhood children. Winters came with their own harsh beauty, the green fields turned to a stark, barren land. Snow, when it blessed us, transformed all into a wonderland. My sister and I would fashion angels in the drifts and build men of snow. We fought, as siblings do, our snowballs the ammunition of youth.  \n\nIn our snowbound fortress, we played our games, a world of pretend where nothing else existed, just two children amid the silence of the winter, the world beyond forgotten."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, there lies a small town in Michigan, where fields stretch out to touch quaint tourist hamlets. There are no sprawling malls nor the bright lights of Wal-mart or Target, not even the hum of an Applebee's. To reach anywhere, one must drive, yet this place stands among the most beautiful in the world, cradled by water on all sides. My town is flanked by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever your feet may wander, a beach waits to welcome them. \n\nThe neighborhood is a testament to small-town life. Houses breathe with space between them, not the uniform sameness of modern developments. Some are relics, lovingly restored, while others bear the marks of age. Most have full basements visible from the street. Time has clad many in aluminum siding, and each home stands painted in a spectrum that defies imagination. Yards stretch out with their own stories, trampolines and playsets dot the landscape. Gardens grow, and fences keep watch over their charges. These homes speak of Middle America, of those who toil and labor, raising families or having seen them grow and leave.\n\nOn any day, the streets are alive with children, their laughter echoing. Dogs trot beside their owners, bicycles whir past, and rollerblades skim the pavement. Neighbors nod in recognition, a quiet understanding of who belongs and who does not. The scent of grilling drifts by, a wave exchanged between strangers who are not quite strangers. Lawns lie neat, leaves banished with the passing of fall. Grass grows green and the plants are neatly trimmed. It is not a place of grandeur but one of substance, where you sense the goodness of raising a family. Quiet, peaceful, safe—a sanctuary in its own right.\n\nWithin walking distance, the county sheriff's department stands guard, the health department by its side. Down the road, the city recycling center serves its people. Nearby, the crack of bats and the call of names echo from the fields, where baseball and softball games unfold. A small airport hums at the edge, planes taking off and landing, their rhythms a part of the town's pulse. Ice cream can be found with a short walk, and downtown is but a stretch of the legs away. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks distant. It is, indeed, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I abide could be likened to the endless rows of houses that stretch in ordered lines like soldiers on parade, each indistinguishable from the next. In this enclave, the hand of the homeowner's association is evident, their presence as palpable as the asphalt underfoot. As you cross the threshold, your eyes are met with the sight of homes cared for with a meticulousness that speaks of the association's watchful eye. Each yard a mirror to its neighbor, patches of manicured grass bordered by pebbles, driveways short and squat, trees that stand not much taller than a man grown. Garages built for two stand sentinel beside each home. As you wind your way through these streets, the concrete before you is smooth, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. Here, the roads are kept as if new, a testament to the many families who call this place home, yet not one pothole mars the surface. The houses, mostly one story, but for the occasional two, rise like the modest dreams of their builders. The post is not delivered to the door as one might expect, but rather to a communal gathering of metal boxes at the street's end, each with its own key, that grants access to letters and parcels alike. Again, the association's preference for orderliness is to thank.  \n\nSituated at the city's far-flung edge, where suburb meets the till of country soil, there is room enough for all manner of things. Pools, clear and well-kept, lie behind their fences, open to all who dwell within. Paths wind through the land, inviting the solitary walker or the company of a dog. Here, exercise does not demand a park; the neighborhood's breadth is its own track. Retirees form the backbone of this place, their presence lending a sense of security and watchfulness. Yet among them are those younger, professionals still in the midst of their working years. The city beyond, though populous, retains the heart of a small town. It offers what one might need, including a solitary mall, sufficient in its humble way. The journey to the city's heart takes but a quarter of an hour, where stores of all kinds await, from the organic to the frugal, each serving its purpose in the tapestry of commerce. This neighborhood, in its quiet and well-tended way, embodies the spirit of safety and care. While not nestled among the shops, a short drive opens the world of commerce to one's choosing.",
            "It was the first I'd heard of the place, the tale of it come to me while listening to a podcast about folks vanished into thin air. That took me aback some. Seemed every flat in them parts was priced through the roof, over a thousand a month. Strange thing was, neither I nor my friends had caught wind of such a story. Maybe it’s the struggle, I reckon. Some nights, I know, there are those among us who find sleep only through tears. Life ain't cheap, but we've learned the art of making do. You come to find a fondness for the musty scent of flea market trinkets and clothes long sealed in camphor. Life smells less when you're grown. Perhaps you take up smoking, or maybe you just grow too used to the way of things. Yet the flea market, it never fails to make its presence known. The scent of adulthood is like old magazines piled atop a shut piano. It settles into the leather and lingers even after a good scrub. Round here, you’ve got three thrift stores within a stroll. From one end, you can make the rounds to a couple of charity shops, a library, a rare book nook, and a curio emporium. Downtown is a crush, cars and folks filling the streets each dawn, yet inside the thrifts, it’s hushed. No matter the throng outside, the shop holds its silence. A fine spot to lose the hours of a day. And every year, there are more of those. Cars and people surging through. They call it a burgeoning city. Headquarters to one of the largest online empires for trade and delivery, it's still finding its legs. Brings to mind New York, where everyone chases their own stars, asking little of you. Here, solitude and silence are your own, and they grant you that. Not like the South, where a touch of concern means you care. No prying into lives here, truly. You can keep your guard up as long as you see fit, and the city will go on crashing and receding like waves on the shore. It's a place alive with life. Between the pianist next door and the two aspiring singers above, there’s always some manner of song. In some ways, it feels less like a flat of strangers and more a fellowship of kin. We gather for our needs, mark birthdays, grieve our losses, lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be among them. I find a liking in most of my neighbors, and they seem to treat me kindly in turn. I mind my mess and share my food, and they return the favor. I fetch their mail and they mine. It gladdens me to see them, and I dare say they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I dwell in this sprawling, unfeeling modernity, but it's folk like my neighbors what make me feel I ain't completely botched my life.",
            "In a place where the flat lands stretch out beneath the big sky, I make my home. It's a small town in the Midwest, clinging to the edges of a city that looms with its glass and steel. This town, or at least the part where I reside, has seen better days. On the eastern edge, where the sun rises over tired houses, the economy has cast its shadow long and cold. The houses there are humble, some worn with the years, others held together by the dreams of those who barely own them.\n\nYet it is not a place without its charms. The folks here, they nod and smile as you pass by, a silent fellowship bound by shared circumstance. The streets whisper of events that have come and gone, the kind that leave a mark. Crimes have brushed past our lives like a chill wind, but they have not yet laid their claim on us. A young man was lost to a bullet not far from where I write, his parents now neighbors of ghostly sorrow.\n\nThe town, like many, bears the scars of a war fought not with guns but with needles and pills. The opioid plague has taken its due, lives snuffed out by the silent specter of fentanyl. But there are those who fight back, offering salvation in clinics and training sessions, a battle for souls in the guise of education and care.\n\nAnd still, life persists in small triumphs. My son, who walks a different path, finds solace in a school that embraces him. The people there, from the principal to the teachers, they nurture a community where no child is made to feel alone. The town's heart beats strongest in these small acts of kindness and provision, where no child is left hungry or shamed for lack of means.\n\nThe town council has set its sights on renewal, paving roads and planting new life in parks, though their gaze seldom falls on the east, where the old roads bear witness to neglect. It stirs a quiet discontent among us, those who call this side home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town is where I choose to be. It holds a strange beauty, the people warm, the schools safe. The shops provide what's needed, and our home, though modest, holds a comfort that can't be measured in dollars. Sixteen years have passed since we first put down roots here, and the thought of leaving is as foreign as a distant land.",
            "In the old neighborhood there's a place where time seems to linger like the fog atop the hill. Buildings with histories etched in their bones stand watch, silent sentinels of a bygone era. My home is a seven-story edifice across the street from an ancient theater, its marquee long darkened. Down the hill a piece there's a place where people gather, an arcade bar, alive with the hum of summer's warmth, and the people, they come in droves when the nights stretch long and the air is like a balm. In June and July the line stretches down the block, a testament to the pull of light and laughter.\n\nUp the way a few blocks lies the park, a vast expanse given the confines of the city. Encased in concrete with great stone steps hewn with purpose. In winter's grip, the homeless stake their claims, erecting shelters in rows along the sidewalks and those steps. The snow, it seldom falls, but the rain comes with a vengeance, and it seeps into the very marrow of the bone. Their tents, clustered close, offer warmth to those who choose the city over the wild. For them, the family center, a place where the dignity of a shower is within reach, stands just a few blocks further.\n\nThe city's beauty is not lost on me, the architecture a testament to human endeavor, but it is the pulse of the people that draws me in. Hilltop, a name that once whispered fear in the hearts of those who heard it, tales of violence and the sweep of federal brooms trying to cleanse it. Yet the stories linger, passed down like heirlooms, and the memory of those days still hangs in the air. The people here, they labor under the weight of history, striving to keep the streets clean, to hold onto a sense of pride. Whispers persist, warnings not to walk these streets after dark, but I find them echoes of a time past, shadows cast by the light of fear and ignorance.\n\nPerhaps the Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the scars that mark this nation. For all its claims of being a melting pot, the city bears the stains of division, ignorance festering beneath the surface. Yet here, in this place I call home, there's a certain aliveness in the night air, a sense of belonging. I've walked these streets and found kindness in unexpected places, a jacket offered against the chill, a laundromat open late for a moment of respite. I've sat in the rain, believing myself unseen, only to be met with a gaze that said otherwise, a hand that offered a gift and a word of affirmation. In Hilltop, I find the threads of humanity woven tight, a tapestry of lives intermingled, and in that, there is a beauty all its own.",
            "I come to this place when the world was still young to me, just before the eighth grade, and the echoes of its streets were unfamiliar. At first, the solitude was a companion, a whisper in the shadowed alleys of my mind, but in time I found solace in the company of a boy two doors down and another who walked the same stretch of road. They are gone now, but their ghosts linger in the quietude of memory. The neighborhood, a tapestry of American suburbia, remains with its two-story houses standing like sentinels under the indifferent sky. Weekends, when warmth spills over the earth, children’s laughter threads the air like a hymn, but most days silence reigns. The people here, they leave you be unless you call upon them. Trust is woven into the very fabric of the place, unspoken yet steadfast. Not once has my porch been robbed of its parcels, and this speaks to something deeper than mere words. A stone's throw away lies a park, a repository of my youthful endeavors. Basketball, football, baseball—the games we played beneath the sun's watchful gaze. It holds the shadow of pain too, the sharp memory of a broken nose, yet the light outweighs the dark. Now, I walk there with my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to the past as they swing and slide with abandon. Nostalgia, a gentle specter, walks beside me. Diversity colors this neighborhood in myriad shades. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy beckon. Fast food reigns supreme, as is the way of suburbia, and pizza places dot the landscape. The stores, they are filled with everything a soul might seek. Dry cleaners aplenty, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the Jewel-Osco that anchors the street, its name a familiar song in the Midwest. Even here, diversity whispers its presence with an Indian-owned store for those who crave the taste of home. In all, this place is a balm to the tales of discord and discontent that echo from the screens of social media. For this, I am grateful.",
            "The neighborhood rose up around the college like some old sentinel, watchful and weary. Apartments stood like sentinels themselves, blocks of stone and brick, whispering the secrets of the many who have passed through their halls. A smattering of restaurants and bars, their lights flickering like phantoms in the night, offered solace to weary souls. One bar got itself a new name, a fresh coat of paint, and with it, a price that spoke of aspirations above its station, though the spirits within were no less potent for the change. The folks here, they are mostly youth with the fire of future dreams burning bright, or those who scrape by, the cost of living a cruel arbiter. The streets ring with the laughter of children, a school just a stone’s throw away, its walls echoing with the promise and potential of youth.\n\nI share walls with neighbors I do not know, nor care to. Their smoke seeps through the walls, mingling with the air of my abode, so much so that management saw fit to place a mask of fragrance by their door. My partner and I, we chuckled at the absurdity of it. Insulting? Perhaps, and yet here we are. The buildings around me bear the mark of age, their facades worn and weary, yet inside, some hold a surprise of modernity. Down the road, in contrast, are the new pretenders, apartments gleaming with promise but built on foundations of deceit. Their allure is but a façade, yet they stand near the heart of learning, their cost justified by proximity rather than quality.\n\nThere’s a diner nearby, a place where sustenance is served on paper, with the hum of microwaves a constant chorus. Across from it stands a gas station, a place of toil that bears its own stories of hardship. Yet, the city paid its due, and the roads were made anew, ribbons of concrete bordered by green, a touch of civility amidst the urban sprawl. My dwelling is enfolded in trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving their stumps as silent witnesses. Beyond the tree line, more apartments rise, and further still lies 43rd street, a place where neglect has taken root. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings worn, and the trees stand as veils to what lies beneath. Crime finds its den there, though it is not alone in its claim.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, I find contentment in my abode. It stands within reach of the university, a beacon of knowledge a mere walk away. Two bus stops lie at my feet, paths to the wider world, to stores and the heart of the city. In this place, I find a balance of necessity and convenience, a life tethered to a place I can call home.",
            "In a small enclave of duplexes, the cul-de-sac lay like a forgotten relic of another time. The houses, though intended to stand alone, bore the uniformity of their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, each a mirror of the next and yet distinct in the way they absorbed the sun and shadow. There was a camaraderie among the inhabitants, a quiet understanding forged in the simple act of gathering at the end of an undecided driveway. Evenings found us there, where children played with toys and chalk and kites under a sky vast and indifferent, and the world seemed less burdened by the machinations of modern life.\n\nThe landscape stretched out in fields and trees, an expanse softened by the blue of the heavens and the drifting clouds. But this season brought with it a portentous air, the promise of storms brewing in the distance. The sirens wailed their mournful warning, a sound not yet familiar but soon to be, and so we sought shelter. In the bathtub, clutching the smallest dog like a talisman, I hunkered down with my purse and a few pillows. The big dog, obstinate in his fear, barked at the storm from the living room, his voice rising against the hail that fell like judgment upon the earth. \n\nWhen the storm passed, the road steamed in the wake of the tempest, the hail dissolving upon the hot pavement as if it had never been. The sun broke through clearing skies, and rain fell softly, conjuring a double rainbow that arced over the quiet street. I captured the moment with a camera, a testament to share with friends and kin, a marvel that left us all in awe. An hour passed in silence before life resumed its rhythm, as mothers and children reappeared, drawn outside by the promise of dinner and the fading light. For a newcomer from the North, this place was a balm, its southern drawl a music that I was beginning to love.\n\nThe apartment I called home was like the others, two bedrooms and two baths, yet inside, they varied in space and comfort, a mystery among many. Behind the dwellings lay a great field, inviting me to wander to the edge of the pond, a place not meant for swimming. In the early hours, the deer moved in silence, and the bullfrog's song resonated across the stillness of morning. It was a sanctuary, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte, where the rooster's crow heralded the dawn and a donkey's bray signaled the coming night. This was my fortune, to have stumbled upon such a place, a small community unto itself, a gem in the rough-hewn fabric of the South.",
            "In the ten long years since I came to this place, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two worth telling. The day I left Riverdale for Stockbridge was a sorrowful one. I cried for the parting of familiar faces and places, and though it stung, my folks believed it was for the best. They wanted something better for me and my sister, a place where a home was more than a roof and a high school was more than a building. So we moved from what some called ghetto to something else entirely. \n\nOver time, I grew accustomed to this new land of ours, found friends and foes in the halls of the school. Yet, I never came to know the neighbors too well, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis too for a spell. They lived right next door, and in their company, I found a semblance of family. I hold dear the memory of attending Mr. Glen’s wedding, or rather his re-marriage, with my folks and sister. It was a day of joy, a glimpse into a future I hope to craft for myself, where the woman beside me lives like a queen. I remember catching the garter but not the flowers, a small whimsy of fate. We danced until the night grew old, and in that dance, I shared a moment with Marsharii, one of Glen’s daughters. She’s gone her way since, and I hope it’s led her to greater things.\n\nThe neighborhood itself sprawls like a maze, though a GPS now guides my ventures through its winding paths. I have wandered far as I dared, often with Kason and Curtis by my side. We spent hours lost in games and laughter, seeking joy wherever it hid. Sometimes, I find peace in the park, where nature’s quiet balm soothes the soul. There, I balance on sticks from the Home Depot and wield my bokken sword, playing at ancient arts. There’s a court for basketball and tennis too, though it’s been years since I’ve played. My father instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend, under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. Those were days of labor and laughter, and the memory of them lingers still.\n\nThere are many memories here, tales of a life lived and moments cherished, but these are the ones that linger in my mind. And I reckon the finest days are still ahead.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town named Johnston, a place unremarkable in the eyes of the world yet bearing the quiet pride of a locale that calls itself the Peach Capital. This is not written on the stones of history but on a weathered sign that greets you at the threshold. The land stretches out, vast and silent, orchards of peach trees standing in solemn rows, cattle wandering the pastures. Houses rise sporadically from the earth, two-story sentinels clad in metal roofs to fend off the relentless summer sun or the more subdued gray shingles. They sit back from the ribbon of road, yielding their fields to the toil of men and the seasons' yield.\n\nAt the heart of the town, there hangs a stoplight, a solitary guardian over the crossroads where the few stores gather. Here, you find sustenance in places like Hong Kong, a humble Chinese eatery kept by one family, or Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger haven. The pizzeria, once a member of this ensemble, has since shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known not for its prescriptions but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses, stands as a relic of small-town commerce. The IGA, a grocery store, holds its ground, though folks often venture to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General, the town's bustling hub, draws the people with its promise of everyday essentials, its doors swinging open to the constant flow of residents.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small venture under the stewardship of a kindly woman, offers not just furnishings but the service of two movers, delivering comforts to scattered homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, a small domain of grooming and care. A doctor and a veterinarian work in small practices, their hands skilled in tending to the ailments of both man and beast, set apart from the town's core.\n\nJohnston Elementary School stands as the lone institution of early learning, sending its children forth to neighboring towns for continued education. Parks are but a dream in progress, a 2.5-acre promise of recreation and respite, a hope to draw more souls to this quiet enclave. The town lacks the diversions of a larger world—no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no sanctuaries of leisure or playgrounds for the young. Yet in its simplicity, there lies a charm, a fleeting existence that might escape the notice of those who pass by, but lingers in the hearts of those who call it home.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee, where the suburbs stretch out like an old quilt, a road runs between two highways bringing a touch more traffic than one might desire. Yet it's a place of quietude, a neighborhood where folks are known and seldom change. The faces are familiar, their habits too, like the sound of rakes in fall or the hum of lawnmowers cutting grass till October's end. \n\nOur house sits at the corner, watching the world pass by. We know the cars and the people, and we mark the strangers like a whisper of wind through the trees. Dogs are walked, children weave their bicycles through the streets, and we too are part of this rhythm, my wife and I, and our two daughters, growing tall in the shadow of the trees. We work from home, and our comings and goings are as known to others as theirs are to us. \n\nThe grill on the back deck smokes with the promise of barbecue, mingling with the scent of burning leaves that heralds the coming of fall. The winters have grown light, more like an extended autumn, and in these days the garage at the back of the house becomes my retreat. There I tinker with my truck, the open doors a window into the life that moves around me. \n\nHolidays pass in quietude, save for the gatherings that bring a scatter of unfamiliar cars. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, they come and go like leaves on the wind. And though the street carries more than its share of travelers, this place is home, a haven of sorts, and if only it were not a through street, it might be near perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert there lies a neighborhood, a place where the land stretches out in a vast expanse of dust and sand and the relentless sun beats down upon the earth. To live here is to know the color of the world is a ceaseless brown, save for the rare green of a lawn that speaks of extravagance and toil. In the days when I first settled here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide across the parched land. Though time has brought new faces and structures, the essence remains unchanged, a city rising slowly from the dust.\n\nThe people of this place are mostly kind, a testament to the spirit of the desert, but like any city, it holds its shadows. My neighbors are the old guard, friendly souls who have seen the desert change and remain steadfast in their ways. The stores here are the familiar chains, offering the staples of life, yet if one seeks the finer things, the journey must extend beyond this enclave.\n\nConstruction is the lifeblood of this place, a testament to the untamed spaces that still await man's ambition. I find a certain unease in this, for I cherish the quiet expanse that surrounds us. My own craft lies in this realm, a maker of walls and ceilings, yet I hold a fondness for the creatures that call this land home. The desert is a place of stark beauty, a fragile ecosystem that harbors life both strange and marvelous. My children, wild as the lizards they chase, delight in the desert's offerings, their laughter mingling with the wind.\n\nAmidst this rugged landscape, there are places to see and things to do. Victorville offers its own brand of allure, a chance to witness the desert's majesty, especially when the San Bernardino County Fair arrives, bringing with it a sense of festivity and wonder. Not far lies Wrightwood, where the mountains stand tall and cloaked in snow, a place for those who seek the thrill of winter’s sport.\n\nFor those drawn to the stories of the land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the keys to the past, with its geological treasures and relics of those who walked this ground before us. Here, the tales of the desert unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dared to make a life in this unforgiving place.",
            "When they ask about my neighborhood, the description that comes forth may seem set apart from the rest. For there are those who speak from the vantage of homeowners, anchored in lives of their own making. Yet mine is a path that diverges a shade. My neighborhood is the college campus upon which I reside, and the souls housed in the dormitory are the kinship I know. The campus that envelopes it all is part of my claim, though it holds a subtler tether.\n\nDespite this oddity, my neighborhood bears the echoes of what is deemed conventional. Like any neighborhood drawn in the mind's eye, mine too holds houses, people, stores, and parks. Let us first turn our gaze to the \"houses\" that make up this place I call home. Before the exploration begins, clarity calls for the kinds of dwellings found here. There are three: the apartments, the real houses, and the dormitory houses. \n\nIn the apartments, where space is shared, you find two to four souls to a room, and four to six rooms claim a floor. These buildings stretch to two floors, harboring twenty lives within their walls. Then come the actual houses, open to those tied to the school. These are two to four-bedroom affairs, often lodgings for alumni. They are scattered few, a testament to their lesser efficiency. Finally, the dormitories rise, where hundreds stake their claim. Here, two share a room, and it is the common abode in my vicinity.\n\nWith the matter of housing laid bare, we turn to the people. My school stands proud in its diversity, and this tapestry is mirrored in my neighborhood's essence. From varied cultures and ages, they gather. Professional staff find homes in the houses, new students in dormitories, and the elder students in apartments. Words fall short of capturing their essence, so we move on to the stores and parks that embellish the land.\n\nThe school, its own self-contained realm, offers a trove of stores and a singular park. The stores blend dining as found in any land, alongside the school's own unique offerings of attire and provisions. Thus, all that one seeks lies within the bounds of this neighborhood. The park stands as a playground for the diverse souls that dwell here, kept pure and safe by the watchful care of its community.",
            "In the place where I live, sidewalks are scarce and the land slopes away like the skin of some great beast. My house perches atop the neighborhood's steepest rise, a humpbacked hill that folks have christened the \"work out hill\" for the way it draws joggers to its incline. Sidewalks are absent, and so the people tread the asphalt path, a road pocked and worn, treacherous in its own right. The wires of telephone and electricity sag overhead, frayed by the elements, a testimony to the bouts of rain and storm that lash the place. Branches fall with regularity, striking down the lines till they bear the look of patchwork. \n\nEvergreens stand tall and indifferent, their green a defiance of the sky’s gray. Yet the people here harbor no love for them, for they are but obstructions to the ocean's expanse. Houses rise on the hill, each tiered higher than the last, their glass facades hungering for the bay’s view. Come sunset, the waters burn with light drawn from some inner fire, the sky awash in orange. More oft than not, though, the clouds drape low, a haze through which sunlight strains to reach. The days are damp, casting a pall of moss upon all it can claim: roofs, cars, railings. Once my own car, left to languish in the drive, grew a coat of green that cost me three hours to scrape away.\n\nChildren are a rarity in these parts, though a school stands but blocks away. The inhabitants are mostly older folk, veterans of life's work, settled into retirement. Their companions are creatures of four legs, dogs that populate lawns and race down streets in spirited chase. Leave open a door or window at your own peril, for they may wander unbidden indoors. I once found one in my parlor, needing to shoo it back out into the world. Rabbits too roam freely, their numbers swelling till the gardeners curse them for the holes they dig and the havoc they wreak. My cats find them sport, thinning their ranks with tireless zeal. Above, the sky belongs to the birds, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting about, while the occasional hawk or eagle dares the crows’ ire.\n\nStores are a distant promise, but down the slope at the waterfront lie eateries where the sea’s bounty is served fresh. The beach is but a thin line, its stones inviting the hand to hurl them into the bay. The bay itself is a narrow thing, the far shore visible even through the mist’s shroud on most days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find if you're set on it. The veins of the city run deep and wide through its streets, public transport threading these pathways with the constancy of a river. The urban sprawl of New York City does not relent here, and in its embrace, you will find Bensonhurst much the same, a hub where cultures intertwine and histories linger in every corner shop and park bench.\n\nThe scent of the Orient wafts through the air, for in recent times, the Asians have come in numbers, staking their claim upon the landscape with markets and laundromats, their signs a testament to a changing world. Each block tells a story of enterprise and migration, where the wares of the East meet the appetites of the West. Imposing supermarkets stand sentinel, their offerings rich and varied, and the price fair enough to draw even the most discerning of patrons. The convenience of it all is undeniable. Four markets, no more than a stone's throw from one another, speak to the abundance that lies at one's feet.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not a monolith, not solely the domain of one people. It is a tapestry woven with threads of many hues, immigrants mingling with the offspring of their dreams, the children of America’s promise. Still, the Asian presence is pronounced, their endeavors dotting the landscape like stars in a night sky.\n\nThe park, freshly renewed, offers respite and play, a place where the young and the restless find their sport. Courts ring with the echoes of games, fields stretch green and wide. In summer's heat, the fountain's spray beckons, a siren's call to laughter and delight. Here, diversity finds its voice, children of every origin finding common ground in the simple joy of play.\n\nBuildings rise in modest stature, co-ops and condominiums, homes for the many who seek shelter here. Mostly, it is the two-family houses that stand, their occupants as varied as the city itself. The people, kind enough in their way, fill the air with the noise of their lives, the music of engines and the symphony of city living. \n\nWhen the sun sets, the city reveals another face. Safety is a relative term, a fragile thing. Shadows move in the night, and caution is a companion one should not abandon. The specter of trouble lingers; I have known it myself, in days past when violence found me unawares. Thieves too, ever opportunistic, ply their trade, absconding with that which is not theirs.\n\nThe streets bear witness to another neglect, the disregard for the law concerning the waste of dogs. A daily presence, it mars the path to the station, an unwelcome reminder of the shortcomings of civic duty. In Bensonhurst, as elsewhere, vigilance is key, lest your soles bear the brunt of another’s disregard.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there lies a whisper of strangeness, a notion tethered to the bones of the city, not unlike a ghost that refuses to abandon its haunt. The phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is scrawled upon the rear of a building that plays many roles—a pizzeria, a tavern, a stage for music, a dim-lit den where the law is more suggestion than rule. It is both a lament for a bygone Portland of the nineties and early aughts, when the city was a secret known only to those within its embrace, and an invitation to those who seek solace in the peculiar. To be called weird here is to be given a badge of honor, a mark of belonging to a tribe that holds the unusual in high regard.\n\nThe city, despite the tide of wealthy newcomers from the southlands and the rising towers of habitation built to house them, retains its oddities. To be weird is not always to be welcoming, yet it allows for the acceptance of that which the world might cast aside. Like any other city, it bears the marks of modernity, the goods from distant shores, the struggles that mirror those of its nation. Portland is a tapestry of the extraordinary and the mundane, woven with threads of yoga mats and vinyl records, suits and startups. To be weird might simply mean to carry all this with a measure of levity.\n\nIn the quarters where I dwell, bright abodes stand in rows, gardens bursting with herbs and blossoms, and the sidewalks are lined with the offerings of free boxes. These are not mere containers but vessels of possibility, often filled with garments and tomes, waiting for the passerby to claim their unexpected fortune. This discovery, this serendipity, is the essence of Portland, though my version of it is but one among a multitude. There are those who eschew the sidewalk's bounty, opting instead for goat yoga—where creatures with hooves share the mat—or the roar of Timbers games.\n\nThe city is a mosaic of passions and pursuits, dreams chased and dreams deferred, often over a pint too many. Shadows linger over Portland, cast by the weight of addiction and the specter of homelessness, ailments of the mind and spirit exacerbated by the relentless rain and brooding skies. The city offers a refuge of sorts, its services a beacon to those adrift, yet they fall short, as do the hearts of its citizens, who oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all, but a reflection of a broader human condition.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, immutable, watchmen of the north. Each dawn they rose to greet the sun and each dusk they bade it farewell. No matter the forgetfulness of man or the distractions of his labor, they endure, unyielding and indifferent to the petty strife of mortal life. In the moments when the world pressed too hard upon me, clawing at my nerves, they called me to witness them. In their silent majesty, I found a balm for my restless spirit, a quiet strength to carry me forward, one footfall after the next. I came here first as a young scholar, drawn to the northern slopes that loomed over the campus like ancient sentinels. True, the university was a place of beauty in its own right, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, its noble trees. Yet, it was the mountains that claimed my heart, their throne unchallenged. The town itself, with its charming cafés that were sanctuaries of caffeine and late-night study, was not without its allure. A short walk or bus ride to the heart of downtown, and one found themselves amidst the faded bricks, steeped in the aura of ages. Here the town shed its suburban skin, revealing a pulse of life akin to the city's urban heart. But the bustle was brief, a few blocks of clamor before the quietude returned, slipping past the library into the hushed streets once more. This juxtaposition, this mingling of worlds, lent the city an air of mystery, a silent invitation to wander and discover. In such a place, memories are woven into the fabric of existence. There were nights spent under the stars, laughing with friends by rusted swings, and mad dashes through crowded streets to catch a film, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, as with all places touched by time, there were shadows too, memories that cut deeper. The ponds, often a mirror for reflection, were also the setting for my darkest hours, a sanctuary for tears shed under the moon's pale light. It was there, in the solitude of night, amid the turtles and the ducks, that I pondered my place in the grand design, grappling with the enigma of being. So I wandered, past the pond, through the park and the quiet houses, until the main street beckoned. As the sun cast its golden glow upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, I realized my path led northward. There they were, steadfast and unchanging. The mountains, vast and timeless, brushed the heavens with their peaks, more enduring than any man-made tower. In their silent presence, I found my resolve, a quiet voice urging me onward, ever onward.",
            "You might pass it by in a moment’s glance, a place unseen and unheeded. A residential quarter tucked behind the commerce of the world, not a place meant for living, or so it seems. But wander past the vacant husk of an old Whole Foods, skirting the hotels that stand like sentinels abandoned save for the bustling of summer kinships, and you will uncover a hidden thrum of life. Streets lined with apartments, stacked close like Russian dolls laid bare and set in their order, a slow unfolding down the lane. The first you find have whispered tales of ill repute, the kind that live in the shadows, but we’ll leave those for another time, for truth can hide beneath the veils of rumor. The ones beside them, and those beyond, hold tales untold, a world apart from the knowing eyes of most. Across from them, a satellite of learning stands, quiet and solemn, where the young trudge in with the morning’s first light, coffee in hand, battling the waking hours. The iron gates groan their welcome as they filter through, the road outside a cacophony of grumbling commuters, the dance of traffic held fast on busier days. The street comes to halt at another, where a park stretches out, and a center for healing those whose bones have met misfortune. There, porch chairs sit in the sun, a ceiling fan lazily stirring the heavy summer air. Children flit across the park’s expanse, a blur of life against the green, bees floating languid in the patchwork of flowers by the road. Old souls shuffle along with their dogs, frowning at the youths on their boards, nodding at the clusters of girls whispering their secrets of boys and online fame. Beside the park, in a strip mall, a sushi place offers its wares, a quiet affair, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled close. Here, one could ready their pool, adorn their nails, and feast on hibachi in a single afternoon—a testament to the strip mall’s peculiar charm. There is a place for frozen yogurt too, where the young gather, clutching their chilled confections as they skate and vape in a bid for coolness. This neighborhood is a quiet echo of Americana, a slow-moving river of time where change comes with great reluctance, if at all.",
            "In the quiet sprawl of my neighborhood, there lies an old story stitched into the very earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved in two yet joined like a pair of weary twins. My own home, it sits with a modest yard before it and a narrow driveway to the side, a relic of a time when the dream was more than just a memory flickering on the edge of darkness. Once this dream cradled the soul of a nation, yet now it seems to drift away like smoke on the wind. But here, in this place, it lingers still, a whisper to those who will listen, a promise that has not yet faded entirely. The people, though, wear the years heavily, their hope not as bright as it once was. The little yards no longer tended with the care they once knew. Yet cars idle in the driveways, and the children play as if this world were all they would ever need, their laughter the pulse of the street. The school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a bastion of futures yet to be and memories long past. Churches are sparse, their pews empty, but the courts echo with the beat of basketballs. These homes, different to the eye, share a sameness in their bones. There is a supermarket, grandly named Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, while most who walk these streets are African American. The roads are broad, and the children play football, pausing only to let the cars pass in their slow procession. Many here can speak of days gone by when all knew each other by name. Once there was a karate school, but the dreams of being a karate kid faded with the films, and now it is a pharmacy, for in these times, medicine is the balm for all ills, or so it is said. A small theater remains, showing old reels to the delight of elders, an escape from the young who crave the new. An expressway cuts through the land, but its exits lie elsewhere, a decision fought over, the young in favor, the old against, fearing the change it might bring. Now a new high school rises, and we ponder a mascot fitting for our town. Perhaps a cyborg with a southern drawl and a log cabin at its heart would do us justice, a blend of the old and the new, as we are.",
            "In the sprawl of the great city, where the streets snake and twist like old riverbeds carved through stone, the neighborhood stands in its manifold diversity. Between the looming edifices of commerce, there lay scattered domiciles, each nestled in its own peculiar corner. The businesses rise like sentinels, offices and stores and eateries, a panoply of trade and sustenance. There is no famine of new taverns to patronize, nor shops to wander through. Some of these are grand emporiums, the offspring of distant corporate giants, yet among them, small boutiques flourish, their presence a testament to the city's eclectic soul. They line the streets like sentries, their windows reflecting the quietude of nearby residences, which might remain tranquil were it not for the clamor of the city's heartbeat. Parks, green and solemn, offer respite amidst the chaos, where families gather, children laughing in the sun's embrace.\n\nThe people, too, are a tapestry of life woven from threads of countless origins. There in a single breath of space, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice, the Orthodox Jews uphold their ancient rites, and refugees from lands once bound by the Soviet yoke seek new beginnings. Beyond this enclave, the city unfurls further, revealing enclaves named for distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet mere miles apart. But in this city, a mile can stretch long as a lifetime, the roads choked with the ceaseless tide of vehicles, a pilgrimage of metal and exhaust. Few choose to walk, for the city is vast and implacable, and the foot is slow. Thus the roads become rivers of steel, parking a mirage ever just out of reach.\n\nDespite it all, the city's allure draws newcomers, and with them the rising towers of construction, a skyline ever-changing. The prospect of yet more souls and their chariots stirs discontent among the settled. But the diversity of dwellings remains—houses of every shape and size, apartments and condominiums, single-family abodes, and duplexes—all testament to the city's varied heart. In the midst of it, the community, a mosaic of ages and faces, is not as it once was. The bonds that held neighbor to neighbor have loosened, memories of childhood games in the sun now shadows of the past, when the streets were alive with the voices of youth.",
            "She looked out at the endless stretch of cornfields, a horizon unbroken save for the occasional silo, and asked, Where is everything? And I told her, This is it. Her eyes wide with the wonder of it. She came from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw from her door, and never had she beheld such expanse. I spoke to her of growing up in the wide plains of rural Ohio, and in that sharing, she understood a piece of me, the place that shaped me.  \n\nWe traveled the narrow ribbon of road that wound its way through the land, past a quarry filled with still water, and came upon my small settlement. The houses stood, mostly brick and stucco, each cradled by the earth with a half-acre of land for its own. Folks took pride in the care of that land, tending to it as if it were kin. Spring would come, and with it, the flowers, planted anew each year, and the trees that spoke of the seasons' change.  \n\nIn the driveways rested the polished chariots, gleaming under the midday sun, Mercedes Benz, the pride of their owners. As we continued, my grey stucco home came into view, and there was my neighbor, the Korean man with the kind eyes, always outside with a nod and a smile. He'd spend his days with mower and song, and his joy became the music of the place. Age had softened him some, but in his past, he was a healer, a doctor, though now he seemed a part of the earth itself.  \n\nWe reached my home, where the geese wandered the side yard, taunted by our Terrier. Behind, a small stream whispered its way to the quarry, the bullfrogs sang their chorus, and the distant cows lent their voices to the day. Across a simple wooden bridge lay an untouched world, a sanctuary of wild growth, herbs and flowers untamed.  \n\nHere was the heart of my childhood, where forts were built in trees and the chase of critters was my hunt. Always there was something to be done, a companion to be found in one of the neighborhood children. Winters came with their own harsh beauty, the green fields turned to a stark, barren land. Snow, when it blessed us, transformed all into a wonderland. My sister and I would fashion angels in the drifts and build men of snow. We fought, as siblings do, our snowballs the ammunition of youth.  \n\nIn our snowbound fortress, we played our games, a world of pretend where nothing else existed, just two children amid the silence of the winter, the world beyond forgotten."
