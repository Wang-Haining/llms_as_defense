            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. People from many countries live here. There are homes and stores. Some stores are big, well-known places. Others are small shops. These small shops are becoming more popular. They are in malls and on streets. The streets are near homes. People can walk there.\n\nThere are many new restaurants to eat at and stores to buy things in. Some parks are near my home. People often visit these parks with their young children. My neighborhood is very diverse. Many different kinds of people live here. There is a group of people who support LGBTQ+ rights. Another group is Orthodox Jewish. We also have people who came from the Soviet Union. Some people from Korea, China, and Armenia live in other areas of the city. These areas are not far from my neighborhood.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to drive even a short distance. This is because of traffic. Many people in the city do not walk anywhere. They drive instead. The city has a lot of traffic problems. It is hard to find a place to park.\n\nThe city is growing. New buildings are being built. Some people are happy about this. But others are not. They do not want more people and cars in the city. There are many different kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in apartments. Others live in houses or small buildings. Some homes have only one family. Others have two families.\n\nI do not know most of my neighbors. We are not close like we used to be when I was a child. But I have good memories of playing with my friends in the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses here are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway. It looks like the houses in this area many years ago. Many people in this country thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream made people happy, but now people are not as happy. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. There is a school here for almost ninety years. The school still makes students think about the future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches in my neighborhood. They are mostly empty. But there are two basketball courts. Many people play basketball there.\n\nThere is a big store called Super A. It belongs to an Arab family who is one of the few Arab families here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football there. They stop playing when a car comes. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There was a school for karate. But people don't want to be a karate hero like in the movies anymore. So, now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people don't like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and fun.\n\nWe have one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town, but some people said it would ruin our town. They were right, so the city said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot who likes the country and lives in a small house would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not think this is a place to live. It's behind a shopping area. But if you walk behind the old store and the hotels, you will find a community. It is a neighborhood with apartments. These apartments are next to each other like boxes. Some people have known problems at one of the apartments. We will not talk about that one. The other apartments are a different story. They are a secret many people do not know about.\n\nAcross from the apartments is a school. Students come here to learn. They drink coffee and wake up slowly. The gates open, and they enter one by one. People in cars are not happy when they see them because it slows down the traffic. The road divides into another street. There is a park on one side and a place to help people who hurt themselves. The house has a nice porch and a big fan. Children play in the park. They run and play on the grass. People walk their dogs and look at the teenagers skateboarding. The teenagers talk to each other by the playground equipment.\n\nThere is a restaurant that serves sushi. It is not very busy. There is also a store that sells swimming supplies and a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is also a shop that sells frozen yogurt. Teens eat frozen yogurt and drink it while they skateboard and vape. This neighborhood is special. It shows what America is like in a quiet place where time does not change quickly.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. My friend asked, \"Where is everything?\" I said, \"This is it.\" The open landscape was very different from where she lived. In her town, a store was just a short walk from her house. But here, there is much open space.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. For the first time, she understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We passed a big water-filled hole called a quarry. Near it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People are proud of their yards.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers grow. So do trees that change color with the seasons. People wash their cars and they shine in the sun. We continued driving. My neighbor is always outside. He smiles and is friendly. He mows his lawn all day. He sings while he works. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a good person. He worked as a doctor a long time ago.\n\nWe came to my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. A small stream runs into the quarry. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a special place. It is full of trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent my childhood.\n\nI built forts in the trees. I also \"hunted\" animals. Really, I just chased them. I had friends from my neighborhood to play with. Our town can be very cold in the winter. But it is also very beautiful. The trees are empty and look like skeletons. Sometimes it snows and the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My sister made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. But in the winter, we built forts and fought with snowballs. We played pretend and had fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some people, this means remembering the old Portland from the 90's and early 2000's. This Portland was not well-known and not expensive. It had new and different subcultures. To others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people think it is a compliment to be called \"weird\". \n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. The city is building many new homes for them. But Portland is still a little strange. It does not always mean being strange is good. Strange people accept things others do not. We have modern things like everyone else. We buy many things from China. \n\nThere are many ways to be strange. Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe strange people just do not take things seriously. In my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. There are flowers and herbs in the gardens. People put free things outside in the summer. These things are often clothes and books. Sometimes you can find other things. \n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland is special. This is what Portland is all about. But people are different. Some people will never take free things from the sidewalk. They go to a place for goat yoga or a soccer game. Portland has many people who like different things. Many people chase their dreams. Some people like to spend time at the bar. Portland has a problem with drugs. This is often a problem with mental health. The rain and clouds here may make it worse. Portland also has a problem with homeless people. No one knows how to solve this problem. More people are coming to Portland for help. But we do not have enough help. Some people are kind to the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not strange. It is just life.",
            "The mountains are always there. They watch the sun rise and set in the north. They do not change. They do not forget. They do not worry. I forget about them sometimes. I get busy with work and life. But they are always there. \n\nWhen I am stressed, I see them. They help me feel better. They give me the strength to go on. I first came here when I was a student. The mountains near the university were beautiful. The university has many nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. They have my heart. The town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied for hours. I can walk or take a bus to the city center. It is an old town. The buildings are old and small. But it is still active. I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place. This town has different feelings in different parts. It is a mix of calm and busy. I like this. I have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends in the park. We were tired from studying all night. I also remember going to the movies in the city center. I have bad memories too. We all have bad memories in life. The ponds are a good place to think. I sat by the ponds many times and thought about my life. I wondered what my purpose was. I saw turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives. They all have a job. They all live their lives. I thought about my life and my job. I walked to the main street. The sun was shining. The sky was blue and yellow. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were still there. They were strong and big. They made me feel strong and brave. They told me to keep going.",

You will feel like you are in a big city. Many Asian stores are here. Over 20 years, Bensonhurt has gotten more Asian people. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The stores are popular. Many are supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are popular because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. I live here. There are four Asian supermarkets near my home. They are all within a two-minute walk from each other. This is very helpful. Bensonhurt is not just Asian. There are people from different countries and their American-born children. Many businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park near here. It has basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain. People from different countries play together here. Bensonhurt has many two-family houses. There are a few big buildings for apartments. People are generally nice, but noisy. Cars with loud music often pass by. You may hear a car screeching its tires in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but some people can be angry or try to fight. I was bullied in the past, but that was many years ago. Sometimes, people steal packages. Dog owners do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning. I do not like this. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "Where I live, there are not many sidewalks. The ground slopes downward, and my house is at the top. People call this hill the \"work out hill.\" Many people run up the hill during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good in some places and can be a little bit dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe telephone and electric wires around my neighborhood look old and broken. This is because it often rains and storms here. Branches from trees hit the wires and cause damage. The repairs make the wires look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky is orange. But it is often cloudy, so the sun is hidden by fog. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything outside. It even grows on cars. I once left my car outside for a month and there was a lot of moss on it. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near here. Most people in my neighborhood are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs are common in our neighborhood. They run around in people's yards and in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get into your house. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits run around the area. They are big and can dig up gardens. My cats like them, but they can be a problem. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and hawks. The neighborhood crows chase the hawks away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house. But if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This makes the street busier than I like. But it's still a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I know most of my neighbors. They usually do yard work and other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled on a hill near my house.\n\nMy house is on a corner, so we see all the people and cars going by. When we see a strange car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and play outside. We work from home, so we are there a lot. I have a wife and two daughters, aged 11 and 14. So, the other neighbors are used to us coming and going.\n\nWe go outside and play, even when it rains. We also have a deck where we grill sometimes. The smell of barbecue is nice. You can hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. This is because we have many trees and leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of the house. I like to work on my truck there. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But some neighbors visit from out of town on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in a dry desert. It is very brown. People who have not lived here may not know what it is like. They do not see green grass. When they see green grass, they know the owner of the house is spending a lot of money to take care of it.\n\nWhen I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses. The neighborhood is getting like a big city. But it is like this in many places. Most people are friendly. My neighborhood is nice. There are many old people who are friendly.\n\nThe stores in my neighborhood are big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy natural food, you must go elsewhere. The main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because the city is not fully built. There is much empty space to build.\n\nI work in construction. My job is to install drywall and T-bars. I am afraid of the city growing too much. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many animals. We must learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them.\n\nMy family and I like the animals. My children are very interested in lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are things to see in my neighborhood. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. The San Bernardino County Fair is an event you should not miss. It has many activities and fun things to do. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow and learn to ski.\n\nIf you are interested in the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, dinosaur bones, and things from Native American people. These things tell us about the history of Victorville.",
            "I live in a college campus. My home is a dormitory. My community is the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus around my dorm as my neighborhood. My neighborhood is special. It is not like a usual neighborhood. I am happy to tell you about my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has different kinds of houses. Some houses are apartments. These have 2 to 4 people in each room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. One building can house 20 people. Another kind of house is for people who rent. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. They are not very common. Most of the houses in my neighborhood are dorm rooms. These rooms have 2 people in each room. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from all over the world live here. They are of different ages. The people who work here live in the houses. New students live in the dorm rooms. Older students live in the apartments. My neighborhood has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes and other things you need. My school has its own stores. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. We also have a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to play.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. It was hard for me when I first moved here. I missed my friends and family in Riverdale. My parents wanted a better home and school for me and my sister. We moved to Stockbridge. \n\nI made some new friends, but I also had some enemies at school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are good people. I like them. They feel like family to me.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I'm glad I went. I want to have a wedding like that someday. I want to give my future wife a good life.\n\nMr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw her shoe, and I caught it. I also saw her flowers, but I didn't catch them. We danced and had fun. I liked spending time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to find my way around. I like to explore. I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks and my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my best friend. We had a good time. We worked hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have had a lot of good times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. I think the best is yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. It is close to the school. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. I go to one of the bars sometimes. It is a little more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are students or have low incomes. They can afford to live here because rent is not high. There is an elementary school near my apartment. I see many children playing outside.\n\nI don't know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put a special air freshener in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think it is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old. Some of them have been fixed up inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I don't like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think it is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates and most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I heard it is a hard place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now it is nicer. There is a big sidewalk, grass, and trees. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around.\n\nBehind my apartment is a line of trees and another apartment building. I live on 42nd Street. Next to it is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide how bad the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street, mainly in one apartment complex. But it is not the only place with problems.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many things I need near my home. I like that the university is close and there are bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made of special houses called duplexes. They are placed so they look like separate houses. Each one is painted yellow with a white porch and a green roof. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. Children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice to live here in a world with many machines.\n\nIt is like going back in time to a simpler place. We have fields and trees with blue skies and white, fluffy clouds. But sometimes we get warnings of big storms called tornadoes. Last night, we heard a siren and went to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was very hot. The temperature changed and the hail melted. The sun came out and it started to rain. A beautiful rainbow appeared. I quickly took pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a long time after the storm. People slowly came home from being out. Then it was like normal again. Moms and kids were outside and dinner was cooking.\n\nI like this neighborhood a lot. I moved here from New Hampshire. I like hearing the southern accent. All the apartments look the same on the outside, but they are not the same inside. Some are very small. I enjoy walking in a big field behind my house. There is a small pond there. I have seen deer and heard a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms around here. It feels like I am in a small village. We also have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people who lived nearby. They do not live here anymore, but I still remember them.\n\nSome people who lived here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses here. People usually play outside when the weather is warm.\n\nThe neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People respect each other's space here.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have good memories there. I played sports with my friends there. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important.\n\nNow, I visit the park to spend time with my younger cousin's children. They like to play on the swings and slide. Just thinking about the park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is different from many other neighborhoods. You can find many kinds of food near here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.\n\nThere are many stores here with everything you need. There are places to clean your clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There is an Indian store too, where you can buy Indian food or make your own.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I see bad things on social media and the news about neighbors, and I feel lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is a quiet place. This town is known for growing peaches. It has a lot of farmland. Many houses are on the land. They are usually two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep cool in summer. Others have gray shingles on the roof.\n\nThe town has a few stores. There is a stop light in the middle of the town. This is where the stores are. You can find food at three places: a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, or a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy where you can buy some things. They are famous for selling Cherry Coke. There is one grocery store, IGA. People often buy only a few things there. Many go to a bigger store in another town called Walmart to buy more.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things. Many people go there. There is a furniture store with a pet groomer next to it. The store has been there for a long time. They will even move your new furniture for you.\n\nA doctor and a vet are in the next part of town. They help the people of Johnston. We have an elementary school in our town. Students go to middle and high school in the next town.\n\nThere is no park in our town, but they are building one. It will be a small park. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or other things to do. But it is a nice town. You might pass by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my city on a podcast. It was about people who had disappeared. I was surprised. The cost of apartments here is very high. More than $1,000 per month. I had never heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Life is hard. Many of my friends cry at night. We have learned to be careful with money. We like cheap things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you don't smell as much. Some people smoke. Some people are used to living like this. But the old market is always there. The smell of old magazines is strong. It gets into furniture and stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start at the far end, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curiosity shop. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. The city is growing. Many people come here. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own things. No one asks too many questions. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South. In the South, people care a lot about each other. Here, people respect your privacy. You can be alone as long as you want and the city will be quiet.\n\nI like my neighborhood. There is music coming from next door and people singing upstairs. It is a lively place to be. We live together in our building, but we are like friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help at funerals. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind to me. We help each other. I clean up after myself and they do the same. We take care of each other's mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too.\n\nI live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "My home is in a typical neighborhood. Many houses are the same. They are well-maintained. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep them this way. The front yards are similar. There is grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars in the garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and have no holes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not use a regular mailbox. Instead, we have a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone needs a key to get their mail. We also have big boxes for packages. The HOA likes things to be the same.\n\nMy house is on the edge of a city. It is a mix of rural and city. We have a lot of space. There are community pools and walking trails. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk by ourselves. It is a safe area. Many people take care of each other. Some people are retired, but there are also young and middle-aged people.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need. We have a large store with many shops. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to any important place. Then we have many stores to choose from. We have expensive grocery stores and cheap stores with few items. My neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have nice things like pools and walking trails. We can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. The city is to the west. My house is on the east side. This side of town is not very rich. Many houses are rented to or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. When I walk outside, they say hello. Crime rates are a little higher than in other parts of town. There have been some bad crimes in the past ten years. Someone was shot near my home recently. A man was killed by a gun near a bar. Luckily, we have not had any big problems. Sometimes, we forget to bring something inside and it disappears from our porch. Many people in my town have a problem with opioids. This is a sickness that can be fatal. There are many places to help people with this sickness. There are rehab centers and training for families and friends of people with this sickness.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The school is for young children. The teachers and staff are very good. My son has a special need, but he has not been bullied. He loves his school. The parents at the school are very involved. They plan many activities to help the school and the families. The school gives food to all students. No child goes hungry. The school is fair to all students, no matter how much money their families have. The city is making some parts of the town better. They are fixing roads and parks. But the east side, where I live, does not look as good as the other parts. This is a problem for my neighbors and me. We like living here. People are friendly, the school is great, and there are stores to buy what we need. Our home is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from a old theater. A block away is a fun bar. People go there on warm summer nights. There is often a long line to get in. A few blocks away is a big park. The park is for the city. It is surrounded by hard concrete with big stairs. In cold winter months, homeless people put up their tents in a line on the sidewalk. They keep their tents close together. This keeps them warm. They are near a place where they can take showers and use the bathroom. What I like about my neighborhood is the people. Hilltop used to be a very bad place. There was a lot of gang violence. The people did not forget. They tell stories about it. The people work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say you should not walk around the Hill at night. I think this is not very nice. I think it is because of old ideas about people. I am a little bit dark. I think the people on the Hill see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They have helped me many times. I feel happy when I walk on the streets at night. I meet nice people. They help me when I need it. I feel safe in my neighborhood. I feel alive.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the country. Our town is near lakes. We have Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix close by. These lakes are very pretty. People can go swimming in them.\n\nWe do not have big cities with many stores. If we need something, we must drive to get it. Our town is very quiet. People are friendly. They know their neighbors.\n\nI like my neighborhood. Houses are not very tall. They are old and some are new. Some homes have basements. Many homes have yards with big trees and flowers. People have pets, like dogs. Some people have gardens in their yards.\n\nIn the summer, children play outside. They ride bicycles and play on trampolines. Adults walk their dogs and ride bicycles too. People wave to each other as they pass by.\n\nThe streets are clean. People take care of their lawns. The grass is green and short. People keep their bushes and flowers trimmed.\n\nOur town is a safe place to live. People feel happy and peaceful here. We have a police station and a health department nearby. We also have a place to recycle and a park. Our town has baseball and softball fields. We can hear the announcers calling the games. We can also hear airplanes flying by.\n\nI like our town. We can walk to get ice cream and to the park. My children can ride their bicycles to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. People from many countries live here. There are homes and stores. Some stores are big, well-known places. Others are small shops. These small shops are becoming more popular. They are in malls and on streets. The streets are near homes. People can walk there.\n\nThere are many new restaurants to eat at and stores to buy things in. Some parks are near my home. People often visit these parks with their young children. My neighborhood is very diverse. Many different kinds of people live here. There is a group of people who support LGBTQ+ rights. Another group is Orthodox Jewish. We also have people who came from the Soviet Union. Some people from Korea, China, and Armenia live in other areas of the city. These areas are not far from my neighborhood.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to drive even a short distance. This is because of traffic. Many people in the city do not walk anywhere. They drive instead. The city has a lot of traffic problems. It is hard to find a place to park.\n\nThe city is growing. New buildings are being built. Some people are happy about this. But others are not. They do not want more people and cars in the city. There are many different kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in apartments. Others live in houses or small buildings. Some homes have only one family. Others have two families.\n\nI do not know most of my neighbors. We are not close like we used to be when I was a child. But I have good memories of playing with my friends in the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses here are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway. It looks like the houses in this area many years ago. Many people in this country thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream made people happy, but now people are not as happy. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. There is a school here for almost ninety years. The school still makes students think about the future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches in my neighborhood. They are mostly empty. But there are two basketball courts. Many people play basketball there.\n\nThere is a big store called Super A. It belongs to an Arab family who is one of the few Arab families here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football there. They stop playing when a car comes. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There was a school for karate. But people don't want to be a karate hero like in the movies anymore. So, now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people don't like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and fun.\n\nWe have one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town, but some people said it would ruin our town. They were right, so the city said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot who likes the country and lives in a small house would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not think this is a place to live. It's behind a shopping area. But if you walk behind the old store and the hotels, you will find a community. It is a neighborhood with apartments. These apartments are next to each other like boxes. Some people have known problems at one of the apartments. We will not talk about that one. The other apartments are a different story. They are a secret many people do not know about.\n\nAcross from the apartments is a school. Students come here to learn. They drink coffee and wake up slowly. The gates open, and they enter one by one. People in cars are not happy when they see them because it slows down the traffic. The road divides into another street. There is a park on one side and a place to help people who hurt themselves. The house has a nice porch and a big fan. Children play in the park. They run and play on the grass. People walk their dogs and look at the teenagers skateboarding. The teenagers talk to each other by the playground equipment.\n\nThere is a restaurant that serves sushi. It is not very busy. There is also a store that sells swimming supplies and a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is also a shop that sells frozen yogurt. Teens eat frozen yogurt and drink it while they skateboard and vape. This neighborhood is special. It shows what America is like in a quiet place where time does not change quickly.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. My friend asked, \"Where is everything?\" I said, \"This is it.\" The open landscape was very different from where she lived. In her town, a store was just a short walk from her house. But here, there is much open space.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. For the first time, she understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We passed a big water-filled hole called a quarry. Near it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People are proud of their yards.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers grow. So do trees that change color with the seasons. People wash their cars and they shine in the sun. We continued driving. My neighbor is always outside. He smiles and is friendly. He mows his lawn all day. He sings while he works. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a good person. He worked as a doctor a long time ago.\n\nWe came to my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. A small stream runs into the quarry. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a special place. It is full of trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent my childhood.\n\nI built forts in the trees. I also \"hunted\" animals. Really, I just chased them. I had friends from my neighborhood to play with. Our town can be very cold in the winter. But it is also very beautiful. The trees are empty and look like skeletons. Sometimes it snows and the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My sister made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. But in the winter, we built forts and fought with snowballs. We played pretend and had fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some people, this means remembering the old Portland from the 90's and early 2000's. This Portland was not well-known and not expensive. It had new and different subcultures. To others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people think it is a compliment to be called \"weird\". \n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. The city is building many new homes for them. But Portland is still a little strange. It does not always mean being strange is good. Strange people accept things others do not. We have modern things like everyone else. We buy many things from China. \n\nThere are many ways to be strange. Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe strange people just do not take things seriously. In my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. There are flowers and herbs in the gardens. People put free things outside in the summer. These things are often clothes and books. Sometimes you can find other things. \n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland is special. This is what Portland is all about. But people are different. Some people will never take free things from the sidewalk. They go to a place for goat yoga or a soccer game. Portland has many people who like different things. Many people chase their dreams. Some people like to spend time at the bar. Portland has a problem with drugs. This is often a problem with mental health. The rain and clouds here may make it worse. Portland also has a problem with homeless people. No one knows how to solve this problem. More people are coming to Portland for help. But we do not have enough help. Some people are kind to the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not strange. It is just life.",
            "The mountains are always there. They watch the sun rise and set in the north. They do not change. They do not forget. They do not worry. I forget about them sometimes. I get busy with work and life. But they are always there. \n\nWhen I am stressed, I see them. They help me feel better. They give me the strength to go on. I first came here when I was a student. The mountains near the university were beautiful. The university has many nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. They have my heart. The town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied for hours. I can walk or take a bus to the city center. It is an old town. The buildings are old and small. But it is still active. I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place. This town has different feelings in different parts. It is a mix of calm and busy. I like this. I have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends in the park. We were tired from studying all night. I also remember going to the movies in the city center. I have bad memories too. We all have bad memories in life. The ponds are a good place to think. I sat by the ponds many times and thought about my life. I wondered what my purpose was. I saw turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives. They all have a job. They all live their lives. I thought about my life and my job. I walked to the main street. The sun was shining. The sky was blue and yellow. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were still there. They were strong and big. They made me feel strong and brave. They told me to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Bensonhurt is a busy neighborhood in New York City. You will feel like you are in a big city. Many Asian stores are here. Over 20 years, Bensonhurt has gotten more Asian people. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The stores are popular. Many are supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are popular because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. I live here. There are four Asian supermarkets near my home. They are all within a two-minute walk from each other. This is very helpful. Bensonhurt is not just Asian. There are people from different countries and their American-born children. Many businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park near here. It has basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain. People from different countries play together here. Bensonhurt has many two-family houses. There are a few big buildings for apartments. People are generally nice, but noisy. Cars with loud music often pass by. You may hear a car screeching its tires in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but some people can be angry or try to fight. I was bullied in the past, but that was many years ago. Sometimes, people steal packages. Dog owners do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning. I do not like this. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "Where I live, there are not many sidewalks. The ground slopes downward, and my house is at the top. People call this hill the \"work out hill.\" Many people run up the hill during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good in some places and can be a little bit dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe telephone and electric wires around my neighborhood look old and broken. This is because it often rains and storms here. Branches from trees hit the wires and cause damage. The repairs make the wires look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky is orange. But it is often cloudy, so the sun is hidden by fog. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything outside. It even grows on cars. I once left my car outside for a month and there was a lot of moss on it. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near here. Most people in my neighborhood are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs are common in our neighborhood. They run around in people's yards and in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get into your house. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits run around the area. They are big and can dig up gardens. My cats like them, but they can be a problem. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and hawks. The neighborhood crows chase the hawks away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house. But if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This makes the street busier than I like. But it's still a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I know most of my neighbors. They usually do yard work and other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled on a hill near my house.\n\nMy house is on a corner, so we see all the people and cars going by. When we see a strange car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and play outside. We work from home, so we are there a lot. I have a wife and two daughters, aged 11 and 14. So, the other neighbors are used to us coming and going.\n\nWe go outside and play, even when it rains. We also have a deck where we grill sometimes. The smell of barbecue is nice. You can hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. This is because we have many trees and leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of the house. I like to work on my truck there. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But some neighbors visit from out of town on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in a dry desert. It is very brown. People who have not lived here may not know what it is like. They do not see green grass. When they see green grass, they know the owner of the house is spending a lot of money to take care of it.\n\nWhen I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses. The neighborhood is getting like a big city. But it is like this in many places. Most people are friendly. My neighborhood is nice. There are many old people who are friendly.\n\nThe stores in my neighborhood are big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy natural food, you must go elsewhere. The main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because the city is not fully built. There is much empty space to build.\n\nI work in construction. My job is to install drywall and T-bars. I am afraid of the city growing too much. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many animals. We must learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them.\n\nMy family and I like the animals. My children are very interested in lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are things to see in my neighborhood. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. The San Bernardino County Fair is an event you should not miss. It has many activities and fun things to do. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow and learn to ski.\n\nIf you are interested in the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, dinosaur bones, and things from Native American people. These things tell us about the history of Victorville.",
            "I live in a college campus. My home is a dormitory. My community is the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus around my dorm as my neighborhood. My neighborhood is special. It is not like a usual neighborhood. I am happy to tell you about my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has different kinds of houses. Some houses are apartments. These have 2 to 4 people in each room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. One building can house 20 people. Another kind of house is for people who rent. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. They are not very common. Most of the houses in my neighborhood are dorm rooms. These rooms have 2 people in each room. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from all over the world live here. They are of different ages. The people who work here live in the houses. New students live in the dorm rooms. Older students live in the apartments. My neighborhood has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes and other things you need. My school has its own stores. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. We also have a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to play.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. It was hard for me when I first moved here. I missed my friends and family in Riverdale. My parents wanted a better home and school for me and my sister. We moved to Stockbridge. \n\nI made some new friends, but I also had some enemies at school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are good people. I like them. They feel like family to me.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I'm glad I went. I want to have a wedding like that someday. I want to give my future wife a good life.\n\nMr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw her shoe, and I caught it. I also saw her flowers, but I didn't catch them. We danced and had fun. I liked spending time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to find my way around. I like to explore. I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks and my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my best friend. We had a good time. We worked hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have had a lot of good times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. I think the best is yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. It is close to the school. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. I go to one of the bars sometimes. It is a little more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are students or have low incomes. They can afford to live here because rent is not high. There is an elementary school near my apartment. I see many children playing outside.\n\nI don't know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put a special air freshener in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think it is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old. Some of them have been fixed up inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I don't like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think it is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates and most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I heard it is a hard place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now it is nicer. There is a big sidewalk, grass, and trees. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around.\n\nBehind my apartment is a line of trees and another apartment building. I live on 42nd Street. Next to it is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide how bad the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street, mainly in one apartment complex. But it is not the only place with problems.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many things I need near my home. I like that the university is close and there are bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made of special houses called duplexes. They are placed so they look like separate houses. Each one is painted yellow with a white porch and a green roof. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. Children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice to live here in a world with many machines.\n\nIt is like going back in time to a simpler place. We have fields and trees with blue skies and white, fluffy clouds. But sometimes we get warnings of big storms called tornadoes. Last night, we heard a siren and went to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was very hot. The temperature changed and the hail melted. The sun came out and it started to rain. A beautiful rainbow appeared. I quickly took pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a long time after the storm. People slowly came home from being out. Then it was like normal again. Moms and kids were outside and dinner was cooking.\n\nI like this neighborhood a lot. I moved here from New Hampshire. I like hearing the southern accent. All the apartments look the same on the outside, but they are not the same inside. Some are very small. I enjoy walking in a big field behind my house. There is a small pond there. I have seen deer and heard a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms around here. It feels like I am in a small village. We also have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people who lived nearby. They do not live here anymore, but I still remember them.\n\nSome people who lived here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses here. People usually play outside when the weather is warm.\n\nThe neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People respect each other's space here.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have good memories there. I played sports with my friends there. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important.\n\nNow, I visit the park to spend time with my younger cousin's children. They like to play on the swings and slide. Just thinking about the park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is different from many other neighborhoods. You can find many kinds of food near here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.\n\nThere are many stores here with everything you need. There are places to clean your clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There is an Indian store too, where you can buy Indian food or make your own.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I see bad things on social media and the news about neighbors, and I feel lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is a quiet place. This town is known for growing peaches. It has a lot of farmland. Many houses are on the land. They are usually two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep cool in summer. Others have gray shingles on the roof.\n\nThe town has a few stores. There is a stop light in the middle of the town. This is where the stores are. You can find food at three places: a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, or a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy where you can buy some things. They are famous for selling Cherry Coke. There is one grocery store, IGA. People often buy only a few things there. Many go to a bigger store in another town called Walmart to buy more.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things. Many people go there. There is a furniture store with a pet groomer next to it. The store has been there for a long time. They will even move your new furniture for you.\n\nA doctor and a vet are in the next part of town. They help the people of Johnston. We have an elementary school in our town. Students go to middle and high school in the next town.\n\nThere is no park in our town, but they are building one. It will be a small park. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or other things to do. But it is a nice town. You might pass by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my city on a podcast. It was about people who had disappeared. I was surprised. The cost of apartments here is very high. More than $1,000 per month. I had never heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Life is hard. Many of my friends cry at night. We have learned to be careful with money. We like cheap things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you don't smell as much. Some people smoke. Some people are used to living like this. But the old market is always there. The smell of old magazines is strong. It gets into furniture and stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start at the far end, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curiosity shop. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. The city is growing. Many people come here. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own things. No one asks too many questions. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South. In the South, people care a lot about each other. Here, people respect your privacy. You can be alone as long as you want and the city will be quiet.\n\nI like my neighborhood. There is music coming from next door and people singing upstairs. It is a lively place to be. We live together in our building, but we are like friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help at funerals. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind to me. We help each other. I clean up after myself and they do the same. We take care of each other's mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too.\n\nI live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "My home is in a typical neighborhood. Many houses are the same. They are well-maintained. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep them this way. The front yards are similar. There is grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars in the garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and have no holes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not use a regular mailbox. Instead, we have a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone needs a key to get their mail. We also have big boxes for packages. The HOA likes things to be the same.\n\nMy house is on the edge of a city. It is a mix of rural and city. We have a lot of space. There are community pools and walking trails. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk by ourselves. It is a safe area. Many people take care of each other. Some people are retired, but there are also young and middle-aged people.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need. We have a large store with many shops. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to any important place. Then we have many stores to choose from. We have expensive grocery stores and cheap stores with few items. My neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have nice things like pools and walking trails. We can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. The city is to the west. My house is on the east side. This side of town is not very rich. Many houses are rented to or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. When I walk outside, they say hello. Crime rates are a little higher than in other parts of town. There have been some bad crimes in the past ten years. Someone was shot near my home recently. A man was killed by a gun near a bar. Luckily, we have not had any big problems. Sometimes, we forget to bring something inside and it disappears from our porch. Many people in my town have a problem with opioids. This is a sickness that can be fatal. There are many places to help people with this sickness. There are rehab centers and training for families and friends of people with this sickness.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The school is for young children. The teachers and staff are very good. My son has a special need, but he has not been bullied. He loves his school. The parents at the school are very involved. They plan many activities to help the school and the families. The school gives food to all students. No child goes hungry. The school is fair to all students, no matter how much money their families have. The city is making some parts of the town better. They are fixing roads and parks. But the east side, where I live, does not look as good as the other parts. This is a problem for my neighbors and me. We like living here. People are friendly, the school is great, and there are stores to buy what we need. Our home is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from a old theater. A block away is a fun bar. People go there on warm summer nights. There is often a long line to get in. A few blocks away is a big park. The park is for the city. It is surrounded by hard concrete with big stairs. In cold winter months, homeless people put up their tents in a line on the sidewalk. They keep their tents close together. This keeps them warm. They are near a place where they can take showers and use the bathroom. What I like about my neighborhood is the people. Hilltop used to be a very bad place. There was a lot of gang violence. The people did not forget. They tell stories about it. The people work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say you should not walk around the Hill at night. I think this is not very nice. I think it is because of old ideas about people. I am a little bit dark. I think the people on the Hill see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They have helped me many times. I feel happy when I walk on the streets at night. I meet nice people. They help me when I need it. I feel safe in my neighborhood. I feel alive.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the country. Our town is near lakes. We have Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix close by. These lakes are very pretty. People can go swimming in them.\n\nWe do not have big cities with many stores. If we need something, we must drive to get it. Our town is very quiet. People are friendly. They know their neighbors.\n\nI like my neighborhood. Houses are not very tall. They are old and some are new. Some homes have basements. Many homes have yards with big trees and flowers. People have pets, like dogs. Some people have gardens in their yards.\n\nIn the summer, children play outside. They ride bicycles and play on trampolines. Adults walk their dogs and ride bicycles too. People wave to each other as they pass by.\n\nThe streets are clean. People take care of their lawns. The grass is green and short. People keep their bushes and flowers trimmed.\n\nOur town is a safe place to live. People feel happy and peaceful here. We have a police station and a health department nearby. We also have a place to recycle and a park. Our town has baseball and softball fields. We can hear the announcers calling the games. We can also hear airplanes flying by.\n\nI like our town. We can walk to get ice cream and to the park. My children can ride their bicycles to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. People from many countries live here. There are homes and stores. Some stores are big, well-known places. Others are small shops. These small shops are becoming more popular. They are in malls and on streets. The streets are near homes. People can walk there.\n\nThere are many new restaurants to eat at and stores to buy things in. Some parks are near my home. People often visit these parks with their young children. My neighborhood is very diverse. Many different kinds of people live here. There is a group of people who support LGBTQ+ rights. Another group is Orthodox Jewish. We also have people who came from the Soviet Union. Some people from Korea, China, and Armenia live in other areas of the city. These areas are not far from my neighborhood.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to drive even a short distance. This is because of traffic. Many people in the city do not walk anywhere. They drive instead. The city has a lot of traffic problems. It is hard to find a place to park.\n\nThe city is growing. New buildings are being built. Some people are happy about this. But others are not. They do not want more people and cars in the city. There are many different kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in apartments. Others live in houses or small buildings. Some homes have only one family. Others have two families.\n\nI do not know most of my neighbors. We are not close like we used to be when I was a child. But I have good memories of playing with my friends in the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses here are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway. It looks like the houses in this area many years ago. Many people in this country thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream made people happy, but now people are not as happy. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. There is a school here for almost ninety years. The school still makes students think about the future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches in my neighborhood. They are mostly empty. But there are two basketball courts. Many people play basketball there.\n\nThere is a big store called Super A. It belongs to an Arab family who is one of the few Arab families here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football there. They stop playing when a car comes. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There was a school for karate. But people don't want to be a karate hero like in the movies anymore. So, now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people don't like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and fun.\n\nWe have one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town, but some people said it would ruin our town. They were right, so the city said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot who likes the country and lives in a small house would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not think this is a place to live. It's behind a shopping area. But if you walk behind the old store and the hotels, you will find a community. It is a neighborhood with apartments. These apartments are next to each other like boxes. Some people have known problems at one of the apartments. We will not talk about that one. The other apartments are a different story. They are a secret many people do not know about.\n\nAcross from the apartments is a school. Students come here to learn. They drink coffee and wake up slowly. The gates open, and they enter one by one. People in cars are not happy when they see them because it slows down the traffic. The road divides into another street. There is a park on one side and a place to help people who hurt themselves. The house has a nice porch and a big fan. Children play in the park. They run and play on the grass. People walk their dogs and look at the teenagers skateboarding. The teenagers talk to each other by the playground equipment.\n\nThere is a restaurant that serves sushi. It is not very busy. There is also a store that sells swimming supplies and a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is also a shop that sells frozen yogurt. Teens eat frozen yogurt and drink it while they skateboard and vape. This neighborhood is special. It shows what America is like in a quiet place where time does not change quickly.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. My friend asked, \"Where is everything?\" I said, \"This is it.\" The open landscape was very different from where she lived. In her town, a store was just a short walk from her house. But here, there is much open space.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. For the first time, she understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We passed a big water-filled hole called a quarry. Near it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People are proud of their yards.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers grow. So do trees that change color with the seasons. People wash their cars and they shine in the sun. We continued driving. My neighbor is always outside. He smiles and is friendly. He mows his lawn all day. He sings while he works. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a good person. He worked as a doctor a long time ago.\n\nWe came to my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. A small stream runs into the quarry. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a special place. It is full of trees, herbs, and flowers that grow naturally. This is where I spent my childhood.\n\nI built forts in the trees. I also \"hunted\" animals. Really, I just chased them. I had friends from my neighborhood to play with. Our town can be very cold in the winter. But it is also very beautiful. The trees are empty and look like skeletons. Sometimes it snows and the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My sister made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. But in the winter, we built forts and fought with snowballs. We played pretend and had fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some people, this means remembering the old Portland from the 90's and early 2000's. This Portland was not well-known and not expensive. It had new and different subcultures. To others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people think it is a compliment to be called \"weird\". \n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. The city is building many new homes for them. But Portland is still a little strange. It does not always mean being strange is good. Strange people accept things others do not. We have modern things like everyone else. We buy many things from China. \n\nThere are many ways to be strange. Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe strange people just do not take things seriously. In my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. There are flowers and herbs in the gardens. People put free things outside in the summer. These things are often clothes and books. Sometimes you can find other things. \n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland is special. This is what Portland is all about. But people are different. Some people will never take free things from the sidewalk. They go to a place for goat yoga or a soccer game. Portland has many people who like different things. Many people chase their dreams. Some people like to spend time at the bar. Portland has a problem with drugs. This is often a problem with mental health. The rain and clouds here may make it worse. Portland also has a problem with homeless people. No one knows how to solve this problem. More people are coming to Portland for help. But we do not have enough help. Some people are kind to the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not strange. It is just life.",
            "The mountains are always there. They watch the sun rise and set in the north. They do not change. They do not forget. They do not worry. I forget about them sometimes. I get busy with work and life. But they are always there. \n\nWhen I am stressed, I see them. They help me feel better. They give me the strength to go on. I first came here when I was a student. The mountains near the university were beautiful. The university has many nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. They have my heart. The town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied for hours. I can walk or take a bus to the city center. It is an old town. The buildings are old and small. But it is still active. I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place. This town has different feelings in different parts. It is a mix of calm and busy. I like this. I have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends in the park. We were tired from studying all night. I also remember going to the movies in the city center. I have bad memories too. We all have bad memories in life. The ponds are a good place to think. I sat by the ponds many times and thought about my life. I wondered what my purpose was. I saw turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives. They all have a job. They all live their lives. I thought about my life and my job. I walked to the main street. The sun was shining. The sky was blue and yellow. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were still there. They were strong and big. They made me feel strong and brave. They told me to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Bensonhurt is a busy neighborhood in New York City. You will feel like you are in a big city. Many Asian stores are here. Over 20 years, Bensonhurt has gotten more Asian people. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The stores are popular. Many are supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are popular because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. I live here. There are four Asian supermarkets near my home. They are all within a two-minute walk from each other. This is very helpful. Bensonhurt is not just Asian. There are people from different countries and their American-born children. Many businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park near here. It has basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain. People from different countries play together here. Bensonhurt has many two-family houses. There are a few big buildings for apartments. People are generally nice, but noisy. Cars with loud music often pass by. You may hear a car screeching its tires in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but some people can be angry or try to fight. I was bullied in the past, but that was many years ago. Sometimes, people steal packages. Dog owners do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning. I do not like this. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "Where I live, there are not many sidewalks. The ground slopes downward, and my house is at the top. People call this hill the \"work out hill.\" Many people run up the hill during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good in some places and can be a little bit dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe telephone and electric wires around my neighborhood look old and broken. This is because it often rains and storms here. Branches from trees hit the wires and cause damage. The repairs make the wires look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees around. But people here do not like the trees. They cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky is orange. But it is often cloudy, so the sun is hidden by fog. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything outside. It even grows on cars. I once left my car outside for a month and there was a lot of moss on it. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near here. Most people in my neighborhood are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs are common in our neighborhood. They run around in people's yards and in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get into your house. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits run around the area. They are big and can dig up gardens. My cats like them, but they can be a problem. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and hawks. The neighborhood crows chase the hawks away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house. But if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This makes the street busier than I like. But it's still a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I know most of my neighbors. They usually do yard work and other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled on a hill near my house.\n\nMy house is on a corner, so we see all the people and cars going by. When we see a strange car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and play outside. We work from home, so we are there a lot. I have a wife and two daughters, aged 11 and 14. So, the other neighbors are used to us coming and going.\n\nWe go outside and play, even when it rains. We also have a deck where we grill sometimes. The smell of barbecue is nice. You can hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. This is because we have many trees and leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of the house. I like to work on my truck there. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But some neighbors visit from out of town on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in a dry desert. It is very brown. People who have not lived here may not know what it is like. They do not see green grass. When they see green grass, they know the owner of the house is spending a lot of money to take care of it.\n\nWhen I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses. The neighborhood is getting like a big city. But it is like this in many places. Most people are friendly. My neighborhood is nice. There are many old people who are friendly.\n\nThe stores in my neighborhood are big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy natural food, you must go elsewhere. The main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because the city is not fully built. There is much empty space to build.\n\nI work in construction. My job is to install drywall and T-bars. I am afraid of the city growing too much. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many animals. We must learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them.\n\nMy family and I like the animals. My children are very interested in lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are things to see in my neighborhood. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. The San Bernardino County Fair is an event you should not miss. It has many activities and fun things to do. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow and learn to ski.\n\nIf you are interested in the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, dinosaur bones, and things from Native American people. These things tell us about the history of Victorville.",
            "I live in a college campus. My home is a dormitory. My community is the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus around my dorm as my neighborhood. My neighborhood is special. It is not like a usual neighborhood. I am happy to tell you about my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has different kinds of houses. Some houses are apartments. These have 2 to 4 people in each room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. One building can house 20 people. Another kind of house is for people who rent. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. They are not very common. Most of the houses in my neighborhood are dorm rooms. These rooms have 2 people in each room. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from all over the world live here. They are of different ages. The people who work here live in the houses. New students live in the dorm rooms. Older students live in the apartments. My neighborhood has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes and other things you need. My school has its own stores. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. We also have a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to play.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. It was hard for me when I first moved here. I missed my friends and family in Riverdale. My parents wanted a better home and school for me and my sister. We moved to Stockbridge. \n\nI made some new friends, but I also had some enemies at school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are good people. I like them. They feel like family to me.\n\nI remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I'm glad I went. I want to have a wedding like that someday. I want to give my future wife a good life.\n\nMr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw her shoe, and I caught it. I also saw her flowers, but I didn't catch them. We danced and had fun. I liked spending time with Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to find my way around. I like to explore. I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks and my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my best friend. We had a good time. We worked hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have had a lot of good times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. I think the best is yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. It is close to the school. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. I go to one of the bars sometimes. It is a little more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are students or have low incomes. They can afford to live here because rent is not high. There is an elementary school near my apartment. I see many children playing outside.\n\nI don't know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put a special air freshener in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think it is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old. Some of them have been fixed up inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I don't like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think it is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates and most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. I heard it is a hard place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now it is nicer. There is a big sidewalk, grass, and trees. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around.\n\nBehind my apartment is a line of trees and another apartment building. I live on 42nd Street. Next to it is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide how bad the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street, mainly in one apartment complex. But it is not the only place with problems.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many things I need near my home. I like that the university is close and there are bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made of special houses called duplexes. They are placed so they look like separate houses. Each one is painted yellow with a white porch and a green roof. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. Children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice to live here in a world with many machines.\n\nIt is like going back in time to a simpler place. We have fields and trees with blue skies and white, fluffy clouds. But sometimes we get warnings of big storms called tornadoes. Last night, we heard a siren and went to a safe place. I was in the bathtub with my little dog and a few pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was very hot. The temperature changed and the hail melted. The sun came out and it started to rain. A beautiful rainbow appeared. I quickly took pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a long time after the storm. People slowly came home from being out. Then it was like normal again. Moms and kids were outside and dinner was cooking.\n\nI like this neighborhood a lot. I moved here from New Hampshire. I like hearing the southern accent. All the apartments look the same on the outside, but they are not the same inside. Some are very small. I enjoy walking in a big field behind my house. There is a small pond there. I have seen deer and heard a big frog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms around here. It feels like I am in a small village. We also have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people who lived nearby. They do not live here anymore, but I still remember them.\n\nSome people who lived here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses here. People usually play outside when the weather is warm.\n\nThe neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People respect each other's space here.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have good memories there. I played sports with my friends there. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important.\n\nNow, I visit the park to spend time with my younger cousin's children. They like to play on the swings and slide. Just thinking about the park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is different from many other neighborhoods. You can find many kinds of food near here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash.\n\nThere are many stores here with everything you need. There are places to clean your clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There is an Indian store too, where you can buy Indian food or make your own.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I see bad things on social media and the news about neighbors, and I feel lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is a quiet place. This town is known for growing peaches. It has a lot of farmland. Many houses are on the land. They are usually two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep cool in summer. Others have gray shingles on the roof.\n\nThe town has a few stores. There is a stop light in the middle of the town. This is where the stores are. You can find food at three places: a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, or a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy where you can buy some things. They are famous for selling Cherry Coke. There is one grocery store, IGA. People often buy only a few things there. Many go to a bigger store in another town called Walmart to buy more.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things. Many people go there. There is a furniture store with a pet groomer next to it. The store has been there for a long time. They will even move your new furniture for you.\n\nA doctor and a vet are in the next part of town. They help the people of Johnston. We have an elementary school in our town. Students go to middle and high school in the next town.\n\nThere is no park in our town, but they are building one. It will be a small park. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or other things to do. But it is a nice town. You might pass by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my city on a podcast. It was about people who had disappeared. I was surprised. The cost of apartments here is very high. More than $1,000 per month. I had never heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Life is hard. Many of my friends cry at night. We have learned to be careful with money. We like cheap things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you don't smell as much. Some people smoke. Some people are used to living like this. But the old market is always there. The smell of old magazines is strong. It gets into furniture and stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start at the far end, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curiosity shop. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. The city is growing. Many people come here. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own things. No one asks too many questions. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South. In the South, people care a lot about each other. Here, people respect your privacy. You can be alone as long as you want and the city will be quiet.\n\nI like my neighborhood. There is music coming from next door and people singing upstairs. It is a lively place to be. We live together in our building, but we are like friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help at funerals. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind to me. We help each other. I clean up after myself and they do the same. We take care of each other's mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too.\n\nI live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "My home is in a typical neighborhood. Many houses are the same. They are well-maintained. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep them this way. The front yards are similar. There is grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars in the garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and have no holes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not use a regular mailbox. Instead, we have a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone needs a key to get their mail. We also have big boxes for packages. The HOA likes things to be the same.\n\nMy house is on the edge of a city. It is a mix of rural and city. We have a lot of space. There are community pools and walking trails. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk by ourselves. It is a safe area. Many people take care of each other. Some people are retired, but there are also young and middle-aged people.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need. We have a large store with many shops. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to any important place. Then we have many stores to choose from. We have expensive grocery stores and cheap stores with few items. My neighborhood is safe and well-maintained. We have nice things like pools and walking trails. We can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. The city is to the west. My house is on the east side. This side of town is not very rich. Many houses are rented to or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. When I walk outside, they say hello. Crime rates are a little higher than in other parts of town. There have been some bad crimes in the past ten years. Someone was shot near my home recently. A man was killed by a gun near a bar. Luckily, we have not had any big problems. Sometimes, we forget to bring something inside and it disappears from our porch. Many people in my town have a problem with opioids. This is a sickness that can be fatal. There are many places to help people with this sickness. There are rehab centers and training for families and friends of people with this sickness.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The school is for young children. The teachers and staff are very good. My son has a special need, but he has not been bullied. He loves his school. The parents at the school are very involved. They plan many activities to help the school and the families. The school gives food to all students. No child goes hungry. The school is fair to all students, no matter how much money their families have. The city is making some parts of the town better. They are fixing roads and parks. But the east side, where I live, does not look as good as the other parts. This is a problem for my neighbors and me. We like living here. People are friendly, the school is great, and there are stores to buy what we need. Our home is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from a old theater. A block away is a fun bar. People go there on warm summer nights. There is often a long line to get in. A few blocks away is a big park. The park is for the city. It is surrounded by hard concrete with big stairs. In cold winter months, homeless people put up their tents in a line on the sidewalk. They keep their tents close together. This keeps them warm. They are near a place where they can take showers and use the bathroom. What I like about my neighborhood is the people. Hilltop used to be a very bad place. There was a lot of gang violence. The people did not forget. They tell stories about it. The people work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say you should not walk around the Hill at night. I think this is not very nice. I think it is because of old ideas about people. I am a little bit dark. I think the people on the Hill see me as one of them. They are kind to me. They have helped me many times. I feel happy when I walk on the streets at night. I meet nice people. They help me when I need it. I feel safe in my neighborhood. I feel alive.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the country. Our town is near lakes. We have Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix close by. These lakes are very pretty. People can go swimming in them.\n\nWe do not have big cities with many stores. If we need something, we must drive to get it. Our town is very quiet. People are friendly. They know their neighbors.\n\nI like my neighborhood. Houses are not very tall. They are old and some are new. Some homes have basements. Many homes have yards with big trees and flowers. People have pets, like dogs. Some people have gardens in their yards.\n\nIn the summer, children play outside. They ride bicycles and play on trampolines. Adults walk their dogs and ride bicycles too. People wave to each other as they pass by.\n\nThe streets are clean. People take care of their lawns. The grass is green and short. People keep their bushes and flowers trimmed.\n\nOur town is a safe place to live. People feel happy and peaceful here. We have a police station and a health department nearby. We also have a place to recycle and a park. Our town has baseball and softball fields. We can hear the announcers calling the games. We can also hear airplanes flying by.\n\nI like our town. We can walk to get ice cream and to the park. My children can ride their bicycles to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. It has many people from different countries and cultures. My neighborhood is not very close together. There are homes and businesses mixed together. Some buildings are offices, and others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the street. The streets are often close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. I see many people with kids in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very different. One area has many people from the LGBTQ+ community, the Jewish faith, and refugees from Russia. Other parts of the city have people from different countries and cultures. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not very far from where I live. But driving is hard because of traffic. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Many people do not walk, even if places are close. Our city is very big, and people prefer to drive. This makes traffic bad, and parking is hard to find. There has been a lot of building in our city. New apartment buildings are being made. Many people are happy, but others do not want more people and cars. We have many different kinds of homes in our city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, small apartments, and condominiums. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are people of all ages. I do not know many of my neighbors. We are not very close to each other. When I was a child, I played with my neighbor and friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. There are many houses. Some houses are for one family. Some houses are divided into two parts, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway. It is like many other houses here.\n\nThese houses remind us of a happy time in the past. Many people thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. But now, not as many people think this way. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. Many people still live here. They still visit here. It makes us think the American dream is still real.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. They think the world is a big place.\n\nThere is a big school near my house. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes young people think about the future. It makes older people remember the past. There are not many churches in my neighborhood. Most of them are empty. But the basketball courts are always full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people in my neighborhood are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play football here. They stop playing when cars come. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school. But kids stopped going there because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap.\n\nThere is a big highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to build an exit in our town. But older people said it would ruin the town. They talked to the city and they said no.\n\nWe are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People don't usually think there are homes here. But if you go behind the old grocery store, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like a line of connected houses. Some apartments have bad news. We don't want to talk about those. Next to them are other buildings. These are a different world. Most people in the area don't know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. It is not the main school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and talk in the morning. People who drive by get angry because they think the students are slowing them down. The street divides into two. There is a park on one side. There is a place where people go to get better after they are hurt. The building has nice furniture. There is a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and play on their skateboards. Old people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers and smile.\n\nThere is a small store where you can buy cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and eat food while you get a manicure. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt. Teenagers like to eat there and play on their skateboards. This is a special place in America. It is a part of history. It is quiet and does not change.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a city. In her city, she could walk to a store in five minutes. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about my hometown. I grew up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. She finally understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We came to a big hole in the ground filled with water. Next to it was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their yards. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. They shine in the sun.\n\nWe kept driving. My neighbor was outside. He was smiling. He was mowing his lawn. He likes to sing. Everyone laughs at him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as funny as he used to be. He blends in with the grass.\n\nWe came to my house. There are geese in the yard. They run from our dog. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. There is a small bridge. On the other side, there is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built tree houses. I chased animals. I played with my friends.\n\nWinters are cold here. But they are also beautiful. The trees are empty and brown. The flowers are gone. When it snows, the yard is very pretty. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs as our weapon. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own little world. We didn't think about anything else. We were just kids having fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that is known as \"weird\". There is a sign in the city that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this idea. They think it is a way to remember the Portland of the past, when it was not as well-known and not as expensive. Others think it is a call to come to Portland, where people will say you are weird, but it is a good thing.\n\nPeople come to Portland from other places, like California. They build houses here, but Portland is still weird. \"Weird\" means accepting things that are not normal. We have modern things like computers and cars. But we also have things that are different. We have people who practice yoga, people who are business leaders, and people who like to be creative.\n\nIn my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. You can find nice clothes, books, and other things in these boxes. Walking through the neighborhood is fun because you never know what you might find.\n\nPortland is a place where people like many things. Some people like to do yoga with goats. Others like to watch the city's soccer team play. We also have people who like to drink beer and socialize. But Portland has problems too. We have a problem with drugs, which is often caused by mental health issues. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. These people come here because we have good services, but our services are not enough.\n\nThe people who live here do not agree on what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. But this is not what makes Portland weird. We are a city with many different kinds of people, and that is what makes us special.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. I forget about them sometimes. I am busy with work and life. But they are always there. They do not change. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw the mountains when I started my college. They are near the campus. The university is beautiful. It has nice buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are special. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes. Students study there for many hours. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feeling. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is a mix of busy and quiet. You can find peace and excitement in the same place.\n\nI like this town. It is a good place to make memories. I have happy memories of walking with friends or going to the movies. I also have sad memories. We all have sad times in our lives. The ponds can be a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walk around the town and think about my life. I see the turtles and ducks and insects. They live their lives. I think about my life and try to find my purpose. I walk to a main street. The sun is shining. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They tell me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It is not hard to find. Many people use public transportation. This is because it is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban area. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nYou will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people live here. Over 20 years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurt. But now there are many Asian-owned stores. You will see one store every few blocks. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and other things. People like them because food is good, prices are low, and it is easy.\n\nNear my house, four Asian supermarkets are close together. This makes it easy to buy groceries. But Bensonhurt is not all Asian people. It is also home to people from other countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. It has basketball courts, a big open space, and swings for kids. People can play and be happy here.\n\nMost homes in Bensonhurt are small houses. There are not many big office buildings. But the people here are friendly. They are a little loud. Cars are often driving by with music on. This can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was a victim of mean behavior a long time ago. Recently, people have been stealing packages. And some people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. I do not like this.",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. The houses are on a big hill, and the road is very steep. People call this hill the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it every day. There is no sidewalk on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. It has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. The telephone and electricity wires are old and look bad. Sometimes big trees fall on the wires and cause problems. We have a lot of rain and storms, so the wires look like they need repair.\n\nThe neighborhood has many tall green trees. But people do not like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the water. It's pretty when the sun sets and the water shines. But it often rains and the sun is hidden by clouds. The days are often cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. Most people are older and have retired. They have dogs, not kids. You often see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave your door open, they might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have wild rabbits. They are big and dig up plants. People do not like them. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We have birds too, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chases it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is between two main roads, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move here. I know most of the people who live near me. They take care of their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we slide down a nearby hill on our street. We live on the first corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. My wife and I have two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are at home a lot. We like to go outside and play. We also grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but a lot of leaves fall in the fall. We must rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has come. Recent winters have been mild. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. Some families visit from other places on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Many cars are parked on our street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. It is very dry here. You see a lot of dirt and brown things. People know it is hard to take care of a green lawn in this place. When I moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, the houses are still far apart, but more houses have been added. The town is starting to look like a city. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. Some places are good, and some are not. I like where I live because the people are nice. The stores in my town are almost all chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people in my town work in construction. The town is still growing, and there is a lot of space to build. This is a little scary for me. I like my town the way it is. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to the desert for many reasons, like the beauty of the desert. We must learn about the animals that live here to live in peace. My family loves the animals. My kids like catching lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can experience the desert in a new way. If you can, come to our town for our fair. It is a fun event with many activities. Visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski. If you like learning about the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American things that tell us about how people lived here.",
            "I live in a college campus. My neighborhood is not like other neighborhoods. I live in a dormitory with many other students. They are my community. The campus is my neighborhood too. It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on my campus. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2 to 4 people live together in a room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Two floors make one building. Usually, 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They are for students and alumni. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. There are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitories. They share a room with one other person.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and ages live here. Teachers and staff live in houses. New students live in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a small town. It has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things. We can buy everything we need here. There is a park too. It is a public space for everyone. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place. This new place has a good house, a good school, and is not in a bad area.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies in school. I got to know a few of my neighbors. Mr. Glen and his children are nice people. They are like a second family to me. I like them. One day, my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI caught a piece of Mr. Glen's wife's leg strap when she took it off. I wanted to catch the flowers, but I missed them. We danced and had a good time. One of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii, was there. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she is happy.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to navigate it. I like to explore with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me calm and happy. Sometimes I practice my balance with sticks. I like to bring my wooden sword and have fun.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court in our neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. They made me work hard, but I had fun. I hope I can play again soon.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One new bar is expensive, but the service is good. The people in my neighborhood are friendly. They are mostly college students or people who rent apartments because the rent is not high. There is a school near my home. Many children go there. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. Our building manager put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings near me are old. Some have new insides. Down the street, new apartments were built. But they are not good. They are cheaply made. The rent is high. I do not like this. It is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant, there is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk, grass, and the area looks better.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. The city cut down some trees, but it is still a nice place. Behind my building, there are more trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. But the trees hide the bad buildings. There are apartments near me that have crime problems. But I like living here. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. The university is near and I can take the bus easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a closed street. They are placed apart so they look like separate homes. All the houses are yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Many people know each other and are friends. We stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk to each other. Our children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees under a blue sky with white clouds. But sometimes we have to be careful because of storms. Last night we heard tornado sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some things. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of small balls of ice hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road became very hot. The ice melted quickly when it hit the hot ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures of it. It was very nice. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home. They were quiet for a while, then it was normal again. Children played outside while their mothers cooked dinner.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside, but not inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live. It is near the city of Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this good neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I became close to two friends who lived near me. They are not there now, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs.\n\nMy neighborhood has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when the weather is good. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered things online and no one has ever taken my packages.\n\nI trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played ball games with the other kids. I got hurt one time playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe park makes me happy and sad at the same time. The neighborhood is different from most places. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, and Mexican restaurants. You can also get food delivered from apps like GrubHub.\n\nThe stores near my house have everything I need. There are places to clean my clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. You can buy Indian food at an Indian-owned store if you want. I like my neighborhood. I see bad news on the internet about some people who have problems with their neighbors. I am lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special compared to other towns in the state. But it is important for farming. Johnston is famous for peaches. A big sign at the town's entrance says it is the Peach Capital of the World. The town has a lot of land with peach trees and cows. Houses are far apart and are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. They are back a little bit so people can use the front land for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one big light that controls four streets. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town that sells groceries. But people usually go to Walmart in the next town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. The doctor's office and a veterinarian are not in the middle of town. They are small but can help the people of Johnston. We have one elementary school. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We do not have parks, but we are making a new 2.5-acre park. It will be a nice place for families to have fun and for visitors to come. There is not much to do in town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But Johnston is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast. It was about people who went missing. I was surprised. The apartments in my area cost a lot of money - over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this story. My friends also did not know. Maybe this is the problem. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive. But my friends and I have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might start to smoke or get used to things. But second-hand stores always remind us of home. There are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning. But the second-hand stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It is a growing city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. But it is nice to be here. There is music coming from the piano next door and singing from upstairs. It is always something happening. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We are lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to clean my space and leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company too.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. Many people live here. There is a group called a homeowner's association that helps take care of the neighborhood. This group makes sure the homes are neat and nice.\n\nWhen you enter the neighborhood, you see many single-family homes. They are well-maintained because of the homeowner's association. The front yards are similar. There is a small lawn, some decorative rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage.\n\nThe streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any bad holes in the road. Most homes are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. This area is part rural, part suburban. There is a lot of space. We have many community pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself.\n\nThe neighborhood is big. You can run around it and get some exercise. Many people who live here are retired. This is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some younger people also live here.\n\nOur city is not very big, but it feels small. We have many things that we need. There is one big shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many different stores. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to a big shopping area to find what we need.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is an area with low property values. Many people in this area rent or own their homes with low incomes. But it is not an ugly or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other areas. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. A man was shot outside a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by these problems. Sometimes we lose things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nThe town where I live has a big problem. It is called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from taking too much fentanyl. But we have help for people who need it. There are centers to treat addiction and places to learn how to help loved ones.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are kind. My son has special needs, but he is not bullied. Everyone is friendly at the school. They have many events to help families learn and get involved.\n\nThe school is special. It gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child has to go hungry. The town leaders have made improvements to the city. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and not in our area. We wish they would make changes here too.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is located on a hill. Many buildings with history are around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from the theater is a fun bar where people go on warm summer nights. This bar is popular. Many people want to go in. A short walk from my house is a big park. The park is for the whole city. It is surrounded by concrete and stairs. In the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. They are near a place where they can wash and get warm. This is helpful. They can also walk or take public transportation to a family center where they can get food and help.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the history. I like the people. Many years ago, this neighborhood was very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police tried to make it better. The people remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it. The people work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. They say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is true, but I also think it is unfair. I think it is because of the way some people were treated a long time ago. I am not entirely white. I feel safe here. I like the people who live here. They are kind to me. They keep me safe. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are honest and nice. They will give me money if I need it. They say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. There are farms and small towns. There is no big city with many stores. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live in a very beautiful place near the water. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake called Lake Michigan on one side and another lake, Lake Charlevoix, on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to swim at. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not crowded together. They are not the same, old or new. Some houses are old and have been changed. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are many colors of houses in my neighborhood. Most houses have a yard with a trampoline or a playset. Some people have gardens and animal fences. It is like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and you can tell who is from around here and who is not. You can see someone grilling outside and wave at them. If you see someone walking a dog, you can smile at them. The lawns are well taken care of. There are no leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and kept short. If people have plants, they are kept trimmed. This is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks great from outside. It is a quiet and safe place to live. It is a good place to raise a family. Within walking distance, there is a police department and a health office. There is also a place where people take their trash. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers calling the game. We also have a small airport. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the ice cream shop and to the center of town. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is not far away. This is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. It has many people from different countries and cultures. My neighborhood is not very close together. There are homes and businesses mixed together. Some buildings are offices, and others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the street. The streets are often close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. I see many people with kids in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very different. One area has many people from the LGBTQ+ community, the Jewish faith, and refugees from Russia. Other parts of the city have people from different countries and cultures. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not very far from where I live. But driving is hard because of traffic. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Many people do not walk, even if places are close. Our city is very big, and people prefer to drive. This makes traffic bad, and parking is hard to find. There has been a lot of building in our city. New apartment buildings are being made. Many people are happy, but others do not want more people and cars. We have many different kinds of homes in our city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, small apartments, and condominiums. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are people of all ages. I do not know many of my neighbors. We are not very close to each other. When I was a child, I played with my neighbor and friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. There are many houses. Some houses are for one family. Some houses are divided into two parts, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway. It is like many other houses here.\n\nThese houses remind us of a happy time in the past. Many people thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. But now, not as many people think this way. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. Many people still live here. They still visit here. It makes us think the American dream is still real.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. They think the world is a big place.\n\nThere is a big school near my house. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes young people think about the future. It makes older people remember the past. There are not many churches in my neighborhood. Most of them are empty. But the basketball courts are always full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people in my neighborhood are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play football here. They stop playing when cars come. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school. But kids stopped going there because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap.\n\nThere is a big highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to build an exit in our town. But older people said it would ruin the town. They talked to the city and they said no.\n\nWe are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People don't usually think there are homes here. But if you go behind the old grocery store, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like a line of connected houses. Some apartments have bad news. We don't want to talk about those. Next to them are other buildings. These are a different world. Most people in the area don't know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. It is not the main school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and talk in the morning. People who drive by get angry because they think the students are slowing them down. The street divides into two. There is a park on one side. There is a place where people go to get better after they are hurt. The building has nice furniture. There is a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and play on their skateboards. Old people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers and smile.\n\nThere is a small store where you can buy cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and eat food while you get a manicure. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt. Teenagers like to eat there and play on their skateboards. This is a special place in America. It is a part of history. It is quiet and does not change.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a city. In her city, she could walk to a store in five minutes. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about my hometown. I grew up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. She finally understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We came to a big hole in the ground filled with water. Next to it was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their yards. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. They shine in the sun.\n\nWe kept driving. My neighbor was outside. He was smiling. He was mowing his lawn. He likes to sing. Everyone laughs at him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as funny as he used to be. He blends in with the grass.\n\nWe came to my house. There are geese in the yard. They run from our dog. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. There is a small bridge. On the other side, there is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built tree houses. I chased animals. I played with my friends.\n\nWinters are cold here. But they are also beautiful. The trees are empty and brown. The flowers are gone. When it snows, the yard is very pretty. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs as our weapon. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own little world. We didn't think about anything else. We were just kids having fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that is known as \"weird\". There is a sign in the city that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this idea. They think it is a way to remember the Portland of the past, when it was not as well-known and not as expensive. Others think it is a call to come to Portland, where people will say you are weird, but it is a good thing.\n\nPeople come to Portland from other places, like California. They build houses here, but Portland is still weird. \"Weird\" means accepting things that are not normal. We have modern things like computers and cars. But we also have things that are different. We have people who practice yoga, people who are business leaders, and people who like to be creative.\n\nIn my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. You can find nice clothes, books, and other things in these boxes. Walking through the neighborhood is fun because you never know what you might find.\n\nPortland is a place where people like many things. Some people like to do yoga with goats. Others like to watch the city's soccer team play. We also have people who like to drink beer and socialize. But Portland has problems too. We have a problem with drugs, which is often caused by mental health issues. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. These people come here because we have good services, but our services are not enough.\n\nThe people who live here do not agree on what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. But this is not what makes Portland weird. We are a city with many different kinds of people, and that is what makes us special.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. I forget about them sometimes. I am busy with work and life. But they are always there. They do not change. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw the mountains when I started my college. They are near the campus. The university is beautiful. It has nice buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are special. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes. Students study there for many hours. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feeling. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is a mix of busy and quiet. You can find peace and excitement in the same place.\n\nI like this town. It is a good place to make memories. I have happy memories of walking with friends or going to the movies. I also have sad memories. We all have sad times in our lives. The ponds can be a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walk around the town and think about my life. I see the turtles and ducks and insects. They live their lives. I think about my life and try to find my purpose. I walk to a main street. The sun is shining. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They tell me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It is not hard to find. Many people use public transportation. This is because it is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban area. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nYou will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people live here. Over 20 years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurt. But now there are many Asian-owned stores. You will see one store every few blocks. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and other things. People like them because food is good, prices are low, and it is easy.\n\nNear my house, four Asian supermarkets are close together. This makes it easy to buy groceries. But Bensonhurt is not all Asian people. It is also home to people from other countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. It has basketball courts, a big open space, and swings for kids. People can play and be happy here.\n\nMost homes in Bensonhurt are small houses. There are not many big office buildings. But the people here are friendly. They are a little loud. Cars are often driving by with music on. This can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was a victim of mean behavior a long time ago. Recently, people have been stealing packages. And some people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. I do not like this.",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. The houses are on a big hill, and the road is very steep. People call this hill the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it every day. There is no sidewalk on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. It has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. The telephone and electricity wires are old and look bad. Sometimes big trees fall on the wires and cause problems. We have a lot of rain and storms, so the wires look like they need repair.\n\nThe neighborhood has many tall green trees. But people do not like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the water. It's pretty when the sun sets and the water shines. But it often rains and the sun is hidden by clouds. The days are often cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. Most people are older and have retired. They have dogs, not kids. You often see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave your door open, they might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have wild rabbits. They are big and dig up plants. People do not like them. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We have birds too, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chases it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is between two main roads, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move here. I know most of the people who live near me. They take care of their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we slide down a nearby hill on our street. We live on the first corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. My wife and I have two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are at home a lot. We like to go outside and play. We also grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but a lot of leaves fall in the fall. We must rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has come. Recent winters have been mild. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. Some families visit from other places on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Many cars are parked on our street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. It is very dry here. You see a lot of dirt and brown things. People know it is hard to take care of a green lawn in this place. When I moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, the houses are still far apart, but more houses have been added. The town is starting to look like a city. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. Some places are good, and some are not. I like where I live because the people are nice. The stores in my town are almost all chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people in my town work in construction. The town is still growing, and there is a lot of space to build. This is a little scary for me. I like my town the way it is. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to the desert for many reasons, like the beauty of the desert. We must learn about the animals that live here to live in peace. My family loves the animals. My kids like catching lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can experience the desert in a new way. If you can, come to our town for our fair. It is a fun event with many activities. Visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski. If you like learning about the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American things that tell us about how people lived here.",
            "I live in a college campus. My neighborhood is not like other neighborhoods. I live in a dormitory with many other students. They are my community. The campus is my neighborhood too. It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on my campus. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2 to 4 people live together in a room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Two floors make one building. Usually, 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They are for students and alumni. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. There are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitories. They share a room with one other person.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and ages live here. Teachers and staff live in houses. New students live in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a small town. It has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things. We can buy everything we need here. There is a park too. It is a public space for everyone. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps take care of it.",

My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place. This new place has a good house, a good school, and is not in a bad area.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies in school. I got to know a few of my neighbors. Mr. Glen and his children are nice people. They are like a second family to me. I like them. One day, my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI caught a piece of Mr. Glen's wife's leg strap when she took it off. I wanted to catch the flowers, but I missed them. We danced and had a good time. One of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii, was there. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she is happy.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to navigate it. I like to explore with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me calm and happy. Sometimes I practice my balance with sticks. I like to bring my wooden sword and have fun.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court in our neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. They made me work hard, but I had fun. I hope I can play again soon.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One new bar is expensive, but the service is good. The people in my neighborhood are friendly. They are mostly college students or people who rent apartments because the rent is not high. There is a school near my home. Many children go there. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. Our building manager put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings near me are old. Some have new insides. Down the street, new apartments were built. But they are not good. They are cheaply made. The rent is high. I do not like this. It is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant, there is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk, grass, and the area looks better.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. The city cut down some trees, but it is still a nice place. Behind my building, there are more trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. But the trees hide the bad buildings. There are apartments near me that have crime problems. But I like living here. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. The university is near and I can take the bus easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a closed street. They are placed apart so they look like separate homes. All the houses are yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Many people know each other and are friends. We stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk to each other. Our children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees under a blue sky with white clouds. But sometimes we have to be careful because of storms. Last night we heard tornado sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some things. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of small balls of ice hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road became very hot. The ice melted quickly when it hit the hot ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures of it. It was very nice. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home. They were quiet for a while, then it was normal again. Children played outside while their mothers cooked dinner.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside, but not inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live. It is near the city of Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this good neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I became close to two friends who lived near me. They are not there now, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs.\n\nMy neighborhood has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when the weather is good. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered things online and no one has ever taken my packages.\n\nI trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played ball games with the other kids. I got hurt one time playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe park makes me happy and sad at the same time. The neighborhood is different from most places. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, and Mexican restaurants. You can also get food delivered from apps like GrubHub.\n\nThe stores near my house have everything I need. There are places to clean my clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. You can buy Indian food at an Indian-owned store if you want. I like my neighborhood. I see bad news on the internet about some people who have problems with their neighbors. I am lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special compared to other towns in the state. But it is important for farming. Johnston is famous for peaches. A big sign at the town's entrance says it is the Peach Capital of the World. The town has a lot of land with peach trees and cows. Houses are far apart and are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. They are back a little bit so people can use the front land for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one big light that controls four streets. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town that sells groceries. But people usually go to Walmart in the next town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. The doctor's office and a veterinarian are not in the middle of town. They are small but can help the people of Johnston. We have one elementary school. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We do not have parks, but we are making a new 2.5-acre park. It will be a nice place for families to have fun and for visitors to come. There is not much to do in town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But Johnston is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast. It was about people who went missing. I was surprised. The apartments in my area cost a lot of money - over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this story. My friends also did not know. Maybe this is the problem. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive. But my friends and I have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might start to smoke or get used to things. But second-hand stores always remind us of home. There are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning. But the second-hand stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It is a growing city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. But it is nice to be here. There is music coming from the piano next door and singing from upstairs. It is always something happening. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We are lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to clean my space and leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company too.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. Many people live here. There is a group called a homeowner's association that helps take care of the neighborhood. This group makes sure the homes are neat and nice.\n\nWhen you enter the neighborhood, you see many single-family homes. They are well-maintained because of the homeowner's association. The front yards are similar. There is a small lawn, some decorative rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage.\n\nThe streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any bad holes in the road. Most homes are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. This area is part rural, part suburban. There is a lot of space. We have many community pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself.\n\nThe neighborhood is big. You can run around it and get some exercise. Many people who live here are retired. This is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some younger people also live here.\n\nOur city is not very big, but it feels small. We have many things that we need. There is one big shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many different stores. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to a big shopping area to find what we need.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is an area with low property values. Many people in this area rent or own their homes with low incomes. But it is not an ugly or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other areas. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. A man was shot outside a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by these problems. Sometimes we lose things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nThe town where I live has a big problem. It is called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from taking too much fentanyl. But we have help for people who need it. There are centers to treat addiction and places to learn how to help loved ones.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are kind. My son has special needs, but he is not bullied. Everyone is friendly at the school. They have many events to help families learn and get involved.\n\nThe school is special. It gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child has to go hungry. The town leaders have made improvements to the city. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and not in our area. We wish they would make changes here too.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is located on a hill. Many buildings with history are around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from the theater is a fun bar where people go on warm summer nights. This bar is popular. Many people want to go in. A short walk from my house is a big park. The park is for the whole city. It is surrounded by concrete and stairs. In the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. They are near a place where they can wash and get warm. This is helpful. They can also walk or take public transportation to a family center where they can get food and help.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the history. I like the people. Many years ago, this neighborhood was very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police tried to make it better. The people remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it. The people work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. They say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is true, but I also think it is unfair. I think it is because of the way some people were treated a long time ago. I am not entirely white. I feel safe here. I like the people who live here. They are kind to me. They keep me safe. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are honest and nice. They will give me money if I need it. They say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. There are farms and small towns. There is no big city with many stores. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live in a very beautiful place near the water. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake called Lake Michigan on one side and another lake, Lake Charlevoix, on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to swim at. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not crowded together. They are not the same, old or new. Some houses are old and have been changed. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are many colors of houses in my neighborhood. Most houses have a yard with a trampoline or a playset. Some people have gardens and animal fences. It is like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and you can tell who is from around here and who is not. You can see someone grilling outside and wave at them. If you see someone walking a dog, you can smile at them. The lawns are well taken care of. There are no leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and kept short. If people have plants, they are kept trimmed. This is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks great from outside. It is a quiet and safe place to live. It is a good place to raise a family. Within walking distance, there is a police department and a health office. There is also a place where people take their trash. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers calling the game. We also have a small airport. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the ice cream shop and to the center of town. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is not far away. This is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. It has many people from different countries and cultures. My neighborhood is not very close together. There are homes and businesses mixed together. Some buildings are offices, and others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the street. The streets are often close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. I see many people with kids in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very different. One area has many people from the LGBTQ+ community, the Jewish faith, and refugees from Russia. Other parts of the city have people from different countries and cultures. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not very far from where I live. But driving is hard because of traffic. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Many people do not walk, even if places are close. Our city is very big, and people prefer to drive. This makes traffic bad, and parking is hard to find. There has been a lot of building in our city. New apartment buildings are being made. Many people are happy, but others do not want more people and cars. We have many different kinds of homes in our city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, small apartments, and condominiums. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are people of all ages. I do not know many of my neighbors. We are not very close to each other. When I was a child, I played with my neighbor and friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. There are many houses. Some houses are for one family. Some houses are divided into two parts, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway. It is like many other houses here.\n\nThese houses remind us of a happy time in the past. Many people thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. But now, not as many people think this way. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. Many people still live here. They still visit here. It makes us think the American dream is still real.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. They think the world is a big place.\n\nThere is a big school near my house. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes young people think about the future. It makes older people remember the past. There are not many churches in my neighborhood. Most of them are empty. But the basketball courts are always full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people in my neighborhood are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play football here. They stop playing when cars come. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school. But kids stopped going there because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap.\n\nThere is a big highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to build an exit in our town. But older people said it would ruin the town. They talked to the city and they said no.\n\nWe are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People don't usually think there are homes here. But if you go behind the old grocery store, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like a line of connected houses. Some apartments have bad news. We don't want to talk about those. Next to them are other buildings. These are a different world. Most people in the area don't know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. It is not the main school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and talk in the morning. People who drive by get angry because they think the students are slowing them down. The street divides into two. There is a park on one side. There is a place where people go to get better after they are hurt. The building has nice furniture. There is a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and play on their skateboards. Old people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers and smile.\n\nThere is a small store where you can buy cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and eat food while you get a manicure. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt. Teenagers like to eat there and play on their skateboards. This is a special place in America. It is a part of history. It is quiet and does not change.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a city. In her city, she could walk to a store in five minutes. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about my hometown. I grew up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. She finally understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We came to a big hole in the ground filled with water. Next to it was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their yards. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. They shine in the sun.\n\nWe kept driving. My neighbor was outside. He was smiling. He was mowing his lawn. He likes to sing. Everyone laughs at him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as funny as he used to be. He blends in with the grass.\n\nWe came to my house. There are geese in the yard. They run from our dog. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. There is a small bridge. On the other side, there is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built tree houses. I chased animals. I played with my friends.\n\nWinters are cold here. But they are also beautiful. The trees are empty and brown. The flowers are gone. When it snows, the yard is very pretty. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs as our weapon. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own little world. We didn't think about anything else. We were just kids having fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that is known as \"weird\". There is a sign in the city that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this idea. They think it is a way to remember the Portland of the past, when it was not as well-known and not as expensive. Others think it is a call to come to Portland, where people will say you are weird, but it is a good thing.\n\nPeople come to Portland from other places, like California. They build houses here, but Portland is still weird. \"Weird\" means accepting things that are not normal. We have modern things like computers and cars. But we also have things that are different. We have people who practice yoga, people who are business leaders, and people who like to be creative.\n\nIn my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. You can find nice clothes, books, and other things in these boxes. Walking through the neighborhood is fun because you never know what you might find.\n\nPortland is a place where people like many things. Some people like to do yoga with goats. Others like to watch the city's soccer team play. We also have people who like to drink beer and socialize. But Portland has problems too. We have a problem with drugs, which is often caused by mental health issues. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. These people come here because we have good services, but our services are not enough.\n\nThe people who live here do not agree on what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. But this is not what makes Portland weird. We are a city with many different kinds of people, and that is what makes us special.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. I forget about them sometimes. I am busy with work and life. But they are always there. They do not change. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw the mountains when I started my college. They are near the campus. The university is beautiful. It has nice buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are special. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes. Students study there for many hours. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feeling. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is a mix of busy and quiet. You can find peace and excitement in the same place.\n\nI like this town. It is a good place to make memories. I have happy memories of walking with friends or going to the movies. I also have sad memories. We all have sad times in our lives. The ponds can be a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walk around the town and think about my life. I see the turtles and ducks and insects. They live their lives. I think about my life and try to find my purpose. I walk to a main street. The sun is shining. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They tell me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It is not hard to find. Many people use public transportation. This is because it is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban area. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nYou will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people live here. Over 20 years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurt. But now there are many Asian-owned stores. You will see one store every few blocks. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and other things. People like them because food is good, prices are low, and it is easy.\n\nNear my house, four Asian supermarkets are close together. This makes it easy to buy groceries. But Bensonhurt is not all Asian people. It is also home to people from other countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. It has basketball courts, a big open space, and swings for kids. People can play and be happy here.\n\nMost homes in Bensonhurt are small houses. There are not many big office buildings. But the people here are friendly. They are a little loud. Cars are often driving by with music on. This can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was a victim of mean behavior a long time ago. Recently, people have been stealing packages. And some people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. I do not like this.",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. The houses are on a big hill, and the road is very steep. People call this hill the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it every day. There is no sidewalk on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. It has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. The telephone and electricity wires are old and look bad. Sometimes big trees fall on the wires and cause problems. We have a lot of rain and storms, so the wires look like they need repair.\n\nThe neighborhood has many tall green trees. But people do not like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the water. It's pretty when the sun sets and the water shines. But it often rains and the sun is hidden by clouds. The days are often cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. Most people are older and have retired. They have dogs, not kids. You often see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave your door open, they might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have wild rabbits. They are big and dig up plants. People do not like them. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We have birds too, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chases it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is between two main roads, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move here. I know most of the people who live near me. They take care of their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we slide down a nearby hill on our street. We live on the first corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. My wife and I have two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are at home a lot. We like to go outside and play. We also grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but a lot of leaves fall in the fall. We must rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has come. Recent winters have been mild. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. Some families visit from other places on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Many cars are parked on our street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",

When I moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, the houses are still far apart, but more houses have been added. The town is starting to look like a city. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. Some places are good, and some are not. I like where I live because the people are nice. The stores in my town are almost all chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people in my town work in construction. The town is still growing, and there is a lot of space to build. This is a little scary for me. I like my town the way it is. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to the desert for many reasons, like the beauty of the desert. We must learn about the animals that live here to live in peace. My family loves the animals. My kids like catching lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can experience the desert in a new way. If you can, come to our town for our fair. It is a fun event with many activities. Visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski. If you like learning about the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American things that tell us about how people lived here.",

In the apartments, 2 to 4 people live together in a room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Two floors make one building. Usually, 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent.

My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place. This new place has a good house, a good school, and is not in a bad area.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies in school. I got to know a few of my neighbors. Mr. Glen and his children are nice people. They are like a second family to me. I like them. One day, my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI caught a piece of Mr. Glen's wife's leg strap when she took it off. I wanted to catch the flowers, but I missed them. We danced and had a good time. One of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii, was there. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she is happy.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to navigate it. I like to explore with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me calm and happy. Sometimes I practice my balance with sticks. I like to bring my wooden sword and have fun.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court in our neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. They made me work hard, but I had fun. I hope I can play again soon.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One new bar is expensive, but the service is good. The people in my neighborhood are friendly. They are mostly college students or people who rent apartments because the rent is not high. There is a school near my home. Many children go there. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. Our building manager put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings near me are old. Some have new insides. Down the street, new apartments were built. But they are not good. They are cheaply made. The rent is high. I do not like this. It is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant, there is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk, grass, and the area looks better.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. The city cut down some trees, but it is still a nice place. Behind my building, there are more trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. But the trees hide the bad buildings. There are apartments near me that have crime problems. But I like living here. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. The university is near and I can take the bus easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a closed street. They are placed apart so they look like separate homes. All the houses are yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Many people know each other and are friends. We stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk to each other. Our children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees under a blue sky with white clouds. But sometimes we have to be careful because of storms. Last night we heard tornado sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some things. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of small balls of ice hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road became very hot. The ice melted quickly when it hit the hot ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures of it. It was very nice. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home. They were quiet for a while, then it was normal again. Children played outside while their mothers cooked dinner.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside, but not inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live. It is near the city of Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this good neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I became close to two friends who lived near me. They are not there now, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs.\n\nMy neighborhood has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when the weather is good. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered things online and no one has ever taken my packages.\n\nI trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played ball games with the other kids. I got hurt one time playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe park makes me happy and sad at the same time. The neighborhood is different from most places. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, and Mexican restaurants. You can also get food delivered from apps like GrubHub.\n\nThe stores near my house have everything I need. There are places to clean my clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. You can buy Indian food at an Indian-owned store if you want. I like my neighborhood. I see bad news on the internet about some people who have problems with their neighbors. I am lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special compared to other towns in the state. But it is important for farming. Johnston is famous for peaches. A big sign at the town's entrance says it is the Peach Capital of the World. The town has a lot of land with peach trees and cows. Houses are far apart and are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. They are back a little bit so people can use the front land for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one big light that controls four streets. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town that sells groceries. But people usually go to Walmart in the next town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. The doctor's office and a veterinarian are not in the middle of town. They are small but can help the people of Johnston. We have one elementary school. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We do not have parks, but we are making a new 2.5-acre park. It will be a nice place for families to have fun and for visitors to come. There is not much to do in town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But Johnston is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast. It was about people who went missing. I was surprised. The apartments in my area cost a lot of money - over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this story. My friends also did not know. Maybe this is the problem. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive. But my friends and I have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might start to smoke or get used to things. But second-hand stores always remind us of home. There are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning. But the second-hand stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It is a growing city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. But it is nice to be here. There is music coming from the piano next door and singing from upstairs. It is always something happening. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We are lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to clean my space and leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company too.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. Many people live here. There is a group called a homeowner's association that helps take care of the neighborhood. This group makes sure the homes are neat and nice.\n\nWhen you enter the neighborhood, you see many single-family homes. They are well-maintained because of the homeowner's association. The front yards are similar. There is a small lawn, some decorative rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage.\n\nThe streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any bad holes in the road. Most homes are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. This area is part rural, part suburban. There is a lot of space. We have many community pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself.\n\nThe neighborhood is big. You can run around it and get some exercise. Many people who live here are retired. This is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some younger people also live here.\n\nOur city is not very big, but it feels small. We have many things that we need. There is one big shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many different stores. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to a big shopping area to find what we need.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is an area with low property values. Many people in this area rent or own their homes with low incomes. But it is not an ugly or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other areas. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. A man was shot outside a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by these problems. Sometimes we lose things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nThe town where I live has a big problem. It is called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from taking too much fentanyl. But we have help for people who need it. There are centers to treat addiction and places to learn how to help loved ones.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are kind. My son has special needs, but he is not bullied. Everyone is friendly at the school. They have many events to help families learn and get involved.\n\nThe school is special. It gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child has to go hungry. The town leaders have made improvements to the city. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and not in our area. We wish they would make changes here too.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is located on a hill. Many buildings with history are around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from the theater is a fun bar where people go on warm summer nights. This bar is popular. Many people want to go in. A short walk from my house is a big park. The park is for the whole city. It is surrounded by concrete and stairs. In the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. They are near a place where they can wash and get warm. This is helpful. They can also walk or take public transportation to a family center where they can get food and help.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the history. I like the people. Many years ago, this neighborhood was very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police tried to make it better. The people remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it. The people work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. They say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is true, but I also think it is unfair. I think it is because of the way some people were treated a long time ago. I am not entirely white. I feel safe here. I like the people who live here. They are kind to me. They keep me safe. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are honest and nice. They will give me money if I need it. They say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. There are farms and small towns. There is no big city with many stores. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live in a very beautiful place near the water. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake called Lake Michigan on one side and another lake, Lake Charlevoix, on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to swim at. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not crowded together. They are not the same, old or new. Some houses are old and have been changed. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are many colors of houses in my neighborhood. Most houses have a yard with a trampoline or a playset. Some people have gardens and animal fences. It is like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and you can tell who is from around here and who is not. You can see someone grilling outside and wave at them. If you see someone walking a dog, you can smile at them. The lawns are well taken care of. There are no leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and kept short. If people have plants, they are kept trimmed. This is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks great from outside. It is a quiet and safe place to live. It is a good place to raise a family. Within walking distance, there is a police department and a health office. There is also a place where people take their trash. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers calling the game. We also have a small airport. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the ice cream shop and to the center of town. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is not far away. This is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is different. There are many kinds of homes. Some are near businesses, like stores and restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are popular too. They are on the street and in shopping centers. People like to walk to these stores. There are parks near my home. I see families with young children in these parks. My neighborhood is also different. We have people from many countries and with different lifestyles. We have a special community for people who love each other in a different way. We also have a community for Jewish people and for people who came from a country called the Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different countries and races. We have neighborhoods for Korean people, Chinese people, and Armenian people. These neighborhoods are just a few miles away. But driving to these places can be hard. The roads are very busy. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially in the morning and evening. Not many people walk in my city. We like to drive instead. It is hard to find a parking spot. The city is growing. New buildings are being built. More people are moving in. Some people are not happy about this. They do not want more cars on the road. There are many kinds of homes in my city. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are small buildings with just a few families. This is true in my neighborhood too. I am not friends with most of my neighbors. We are not a close community. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors and we were friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Many houses are for one family. Some homes have been changed into two, but they are still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small drive on the left side. It looks like a place many people thought was the American dream a long time ago. This dream seemed good for many Americans. But now, it is not as popular. People still live in my neighborhood and other neighborhoods like it. They remind us that the dream is still alive. People take care of their yards less now. But there are still cars in every drive and children play outside. The public school is old – almost 90 years. It still shows children a future. It also makes older people think about the past. There are few churches and they are not full. But the basketball courts are busy. All the houses are different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are maybe the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. Cars can pass easily. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They know each other. There was a karate school, but it closed. Kids stopped going because they didn't want to be like the Karate Kid anymore. Now it is a pharmacy. Drugs make people feel better, so they think. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people don't like it because they want to see new movies. But older people think it's a good deal. They can see a movie without the kids. There is one highway that goes through our town. But the highway has entrances and exits in the next town. We used to want a highway in our town, but older people said it would ruin our town. They convinced the city to say no. We are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not see it at first. It is behind a shopping place. People do not usually think there are homes there. But if you look closely, you will find a big community. There are many apartments in a row. Some of these apartments have had bad news. We will not talk about those.\n\nThe other apartments are nice. People do not know much about them. Across from these apartments is a small college. Students go there. They are sleepy in the morning. The gates creak open for them. Other people get angry and honk their horns.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side. A place to help people who are hurt is on the other side. The place has nice furniture outside. A fan moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and play in the grass. Flowers are near the road. Bees are in the flowers.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking near the playground. There is a place to get cheap food. It is near the park. There is a store for swimming pools. A place to get nails done is nearby. You can fill your pool and get a manicure and eat food all at the same time.\n\nThere is a place to get frozen yogurt. The teens like to eat it. They do tricks on their skateboards while eating. The neighborhood is a special part of America. It is a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past many fields of corn. I said, \"This is it!\" I thought she would be surprised. She is from a town where a store is near her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She knew me better then.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water, called a quarry. Next to it is where I live. My house is made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People like to take care of their land. In the spring, there are many flowers and trees that change color with the seasons. The driveways are filled with nice cars that shine in the sun.\n\nAs we continued driving, I saw my neighbor. He is old and always smiles. He mows his grass and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a nice person. He used to be a doctor. Now, he is a little slower. He rides a yellow machine to mow his grass.\n\nWe kept driving and came to my home. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. In the back yard, there is a stream. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. Across a little bridge is a special place. It has naturally growing trees, plants, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood.\n\nI built forts in the trees and played with the other kids. We would chase animals, but they were not real. The winters in my town are very cold. The yard looks empty, and the trees are bare. But when it snows, it is very beautiful. We made snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs to fight. We built big forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own winter wonderland and pretended to be something else. We were happy and did not worry about anything.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The word \"weird\" is important here. \"Keep Portland Weird\" is the unofficial city slogan. It means we like things that are different. Portland was not always like this. It was once a small, less expensive place with creative people. Now, many people from California are moving here. They are changing Portland, but it is still weird. Weird means we accept things that others do not. We have modern things like other cities. We buy things from China. But we also have things that are different, like colorful houses and home gardens.\n\nIn my neighborhood, you can find free boxes. They are boxes with things people are giving away. They might have clothes, books, or other things. You might find something interesting in a free box. This is special about Portland. People here love different things. Some people like yoga with goats, others like soccer. We have many different kinds of people.\n\nPortland has problems, too. Some people have drug problems. This is often because of mental health problems. The rain in Portland can make people feel sad. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland for help, but we do not have enough help. People are not sure what to do about this. Some people care about the homeless, others do not. Portland is a city with many different people and problems. But it is still a weird and special place.",

It has old buildings with colorful bricks. The town is like a city, but not too big.\n\nI like it here because it is not too busy. You can walk to the library and be in a quiet place. The town has two very different feelings. It is fun to explore. I have many happy memories here. I walked with friends in the park. I went to the movies in the theater. But I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond and think about my life. I see the turtles, ducks, and insects. They live their lives. I think about my purpose in life. I walk to the main street. The sun shines on the palm trees. I see the sunrise. I see the mountains. They are very big and strong. They make me feel brave.",

            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. The streets go downhill quickly. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be hard to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot in our area. Sometimes branches hit the wires and cause problems. The workers fix them, but they look broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people here do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and houses. I left my car outside for a month. When I went to use it, it was covered in green moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near by. Most of the people are old and retired. They have dogs, not kids. You see dogs in people's yards and running in the street. If you leave a door open, a dog might come in. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out. We also have many wild rabbits. They dig up plants and gardens. My cats like them, but the gardeners do not. We see many birds, too. There are small birds and big birds that come by. Sometimes a big bird, like a hawk, comes by. But the crows chase it away. There are no stores near by. But if you walk down the hill, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The area near the water is not very big. You can see the other side of the bay even when it is foggy.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is near two big roads. We get some traffic, but it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do other things every day.\n\nIn the winter, we slide down a hill near our house. We live at the front of our street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. We see the cars they drive. If we see a strange car, we notice it.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters (11 and 14 years old), and me.\n\nWe like to go outside and play. We even play in the rain. We also grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it's cool in the hot sun. But then there are many leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe don't have much winter. It feels like fall is long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work on my truck and other projects there. If I open the garage door, I can hear the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, we see more people from out of town. They park their cars everywhere. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the desert. It is a dry and brown place. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like. When I see a green yard, I know the person takes good care of it. In the past, my neighborhood was quiet and spread out. Now, many new houses are being built. The area looks more like a city now. But, it is the same in many places. People here are friendly, but like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near many older people who are kind. This is a good neighborhood. We have common stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy organic food, you must go somewhere else. My town has many construction jobs. The city is not fully developed, and there is much empty space to build. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like my job. Many people like the desert because of its beauty. It is a challenging place for animals and humans to live. We must learn about the animals that live here to live safely. My family and I like the animals. We have three children who like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. There are things to do in our town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. If you come, try to visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and go skiing. If you like history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has objects that tell us about the desert's history and people.",
            "My neighborhood is different. I do not live in a regular neighborhood. I live on a college campus. My home is a dormitory, and my community is the people who live with me in the dorm. I also consider the whole campus to be my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and a park. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on the campus. First, there are apartments. These are big buildings with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each floor has 20 people living there. \n\nSecond, there are houses for rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are usually lived in by alumni. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in dorm rooms. Each room has two people. There are many dorm rooms on campus.\n\nMy neighborhood is a good place for people from different countries and ages. The staff live in houses, and the students live in dorms or apartments. The students who are new to the campus live in dorms, and the older students live in apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about stores and parks. The campus has many stores. They sell food, clothes, and other things. The campus has one park. It is a place for everyone to play. The park is kept clean and safe by the people who live on campus.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We chose this neighborhood for better housing and a good high school.\n\nWhen I first came, I was unhappy. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends and enemies at school. I did not get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are kind people. I consider them like family. I like them.\n\nI remember when Mr. Glen got married. My family and I went to the wedding. It was fun. I caught something thrown by Mr. Glen's wife, but not the flowers! We danced and had a good time. I liked dancing with one of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well.\n\nOur neighborhood is a little confusing. But I have a GPS now. I like to explore. I have been with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm. I like to find sticks and practice my balance. Sometimes I bring my wooden sword.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. We had fun, but they made us work hard! I like to have the court, in case I want to play again.\n\nI have had many happy times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near my college. I like this area. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants, and bars. The restaurants and bars are fun and not very expensive. One bar is new. It is more expensive but good. Many people are nice. They are students or have low income because the apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near my home. There are many children. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. My building manager put a special air cleaner near their door. I find this funny. \n\nMy building is old but nice inside. New apartments are across the street. They look good but are not safe. The construction is bad. The rent is high. I do not like this. There is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. They microwave most of the food. Opposite the restaurant is a gas station. I hear it is not a good place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road last summer. Now it is nice. There are sidewalks, grass, and trees. But my building is very green because of the trees. The trees block some sunlight. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment building. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. There is crime on this street. But it is not just one building's problem. Other buildings across the street have crime too. I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. I like that my college is near and there are buses to take me to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has many houses on a closed street. They look like separate homes. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most people in my neighborhood are friends with each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk. Children play outside with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites.\n\nIt is nice to live here. It is like going back in time in a busy world. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and white clouds are moving. It is beautiful.\n\nBut we also have problems. We had a warning for a big storm. Last night, we heard a siren and had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. We heard big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was very hot. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow.\n\nI took pictures of the rainbow and showed them to my friends on the computer. They were very happy. The street was quiet for a while. Then people came home from where they were. It was business as usual. We had dinner and mothers and children were outside.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. It looks the same as the other houses outside, but they are different inside. Some apartments are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and a big frog that sings in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. I wake up every morning to the sound of roosters. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening.\n\nI am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood in eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends. But I got close to two people: one lives two houses down from me, and the other lives on my street. They do not live here now, but I still remember them.\n\nThe people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. I hear children playing outside on weekends and warm days.\n\nMy neighborhood is quiet. I have never had problems with the people here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have bought things online many times, and no one has taken them from my porch.\n\nI trust my neighbors. A park is near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt once playing football, but I remember the good times more.\n\nNow, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me. They like to play on swings and slides. They are happy when we go to the park.\n\nMy neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby. But many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash now.\n\nThere are many stores near my house. You can find everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. One store is Indian-owned, and it has Indian food.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I see bad stories about neighbors on social media and news. I am grateful for my neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is a quiet place. But it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is very proud of this. Many people grow peaches here. They also raise cattle. The town has many fields with peach trees and cows.\n\nMost houses are in the country. They are far apart. They are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. Many houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the front fields for animals and crops.\n\nIn the town, there is a traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to get fast food. You can eat at Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant. Or you can eat at Fiesta Mexican Restaurant or Gary's burger shop.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town where you can buy most things. But people often go to Walmart in the next town to buy groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things you need every day. People go there often. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver furniture to your home. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThere are two small medical offices in the next part of the town. One is for a doctor and the other is for a veterinarian. There is a small elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in the next town.\n\nThere is no park in the town yet. But they are building a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big. This will give people a place to go and play. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or restaurants in the town. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I first heard about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. I was surprised. The cost of apartments there is very high. Many are over one thousand dollars a month. I never heard about this story. Neither did my friends. We have a hard time making money. Sometimes people are sad and cry at night. But we have learned how to save money. We buy things at second-hand stores. We like the smell of old toys and clothes. When you are a grown-up, you smell less. You might smoke or get used to the way things are. But the second-hand stores are always there. They have a strong smell. It comes from old magazines on a piano. You can't get rid of it even if you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. You can walk there. If you start at one end, you can visit a library, a store with rare books, and a store with strange things. The streets are crowded in the city. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But the stores are quiet. You can't hear the noise. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. More and more people visit the city each year. It's a growing city. One of the biggest online companies in the world is here. The city still has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask each other many questions. You can be alone if you want. The city will leave you alone. This is different from the South. In the South, people ask about each other's lives.\n\nI like my home. It's not a place of strangers. It's a community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays together. We help each other when we need it. I have kind neighbors. I try to clean after myself. I leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I feel lucky to live here.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood. It is like many other places. My neighborhood has a homeowners group. They help keep everything in order. Every house is very clean and nice. The lawns are small and have pretty stones. Many houses have two cars in the garage. The streets are new and smooth. You will not see any big holes.\n\nMost houses are one story. But some are two stories. We do not have boxes in front of each house for mail. We have one box with many small boxes inside. You need a key to get your mail. The neighborhood is on the edge of the city. It is part nature and part city. We have a lot of space. We have two swimming pools and many paths to walk on.\n\nMany people in the neighborhood are old and retired. But we also have people in the middle of their lives. Everyone takes care of each other. The neighborhood is safe. Our city is big but feels small. We have many stores. We have a big mall with many stores. It takes 15 minutes to drive to the mall. When we get there, we can buy many things. We have stores with healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nIn general, my neighborhood is good. It is safe and clean. We have many nice things like pools and paths. If we want to go to a big store, we just need to drive a little.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the country. My town is near a big city, but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not a rich area. Many people in my neighborhood rent their houses. They have low incomes. However, my neighborhood is not ugly. My neighbors are kind and say hello when I walk by. There are some crimes in my neighborhood. But they are not many. Some people were hurt by guns in the past. One person died. But my family has not been hurt. Sometimes we leave things on our porch, and they disappear. This town has a big problem. Many people have died from bad medicine. The medicine is called fentanyl. There are many places to help people with this problem. There are places to help people stop using bad medicine. Some people teach others how to save lives with a special medicine called Narcan. My son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and help him. My son has special needs, but he is safe at school. He likes his school. We have a group that helps the school. They plan events to help families and make learning better. Many children in our town are very poor. So, the school gives them free food every day. No child has to be hungry. The city government has made the town look better. They fixed roads, planted flowers, and fixed the parks. But they did most of this work in the middle of town and on the west side. The west side has shops and traffic. My neighborhood is on the east side, and it is not as nice. This makes some people unhappy. I like living in this town. People are kind, schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is comfortable.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are here. I live in a 7-story apartment house near an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar with games. People like to go there on warm summer nights. There is often a line of people waiting to get in.\n\nNearby is a city park. It is very big for this part of town. The park has a lot of concrete and tall stairs. In cold weather, homeless people put up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. It is not very snowy here, but it rains a lot. Heavy rain in winter can make it hard to stay warm. The people put their tents close together. This keeps them warmer. They are near a place where they can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not the old buildings that I like. I like the people. My neighborhood used to be very bad. There was a lot of gang violence. Many years ago, government officials and police came to clean the streets. The people remember this. They tell stories about it. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city.\n\nSome people say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is not true. I am not sure why they say this. Maybe it is because I am not white. Maybe the people here know me. I feel at home here. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where I feel safe.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. You can see farmland and small cities. There are no big shopping malls. We do not have a Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. When we want to go somewhere, we drive. I live in a beautiful place near two big lakes. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are on my town's sides. We can swim in the lakes. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not very close together. They are old and different from each other. Some houses are new and some are old. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. We have houses in many colors. Most houses have yards. The yards have trampolines, playsets, and gardens. People take care of their lawns. They mow the grass and trim the bushes. We see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. We know our neighbors. We can tell who is new and who is not. We see people grilling outside and say hello. We also see people walking their dogs and smiling. Our neighborhood is quiet and safe. It is a good place to live. We have a sheriff's department, a health department, and a recycling center nearby. We also have baseball and softball fields. We can hear the announcers calling the games. Our town has a small airport. We can hear the planes taking off and landing. We can walk to get ice cream and to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is different. There are many kinds of homes. Some are near businesses, like stores and restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are popular too. They are on the street and in shopping centers. People like to walk to these stores. There are parks near my home. I see families with young children in these parks. My neighborhood is also different. We have people from many countries and with different lifestyles. We have a special community for people who love each other in a different way. We also have a community for Jewish people and for people who came from a country called the Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different countries and races. We have neighborhoods for Korean people, Chinese people, and Armenian people. These neighborhoods are just a few miles away. But driving to these places can be hard. The roads are very busy. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially in the morning and evening. Not many people walk in my city. We like to drive instead. It is hard to find a parking spot. The city is growing. New buildings are being built. More people are moving in. Some people are not happy about this. They do not want more cars on the road. There are many kinds of homes in my city. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are small buildings with just a few families. This is true in my neighborhood too. I am not friends with most of my neighbors. We are not a close community. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors and we were friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Many houses are for one family. Some homes have been changed into two, but they are still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small drive on the left side. It looks like a place many people thought was the American dream a long time ago. This dream seemed good for many Americans. But now, it is not as popular. People still live in my neighborhood and other neighborhoods like it. They remind us that the dream is still alive. People take care of their yards less now. But there are still cars in every drive and children play outside. The public school is old – almost 90 years. It still shows children a future. It also makes older people think about the past. There are few churches and they are not full. But the basketball courts are busy. All the houses are different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are maybe the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. Cars can pass easily. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They know each other. There was a karate school, but it closed. Kids stopped going because they didn't want to be like the Karate Kid anymore. Now it is a pharmacy. Drugs make people feel better, so they think. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people don't like it because they want to see new movies. But older people think it's a good deal. They can see a movie without the kids. There is one highway that goes through our town. But the highway has entrances and exits in the next town. We used to want a highway in our town, but older people said it would ruin our town. They convinced the city to say no. We are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not see it at first. It is behind a shopping place. People do not usually think there are homes there. But if you look closely, you will find a big community. There are many apartments in a row. Some of these apartments have had bad news. We will not talk about those.\n\nThe other apartments are nice. People do not know much about them. Across from these apartments is a small college. Students go there. They are sleepy in the morning. The gates creak open for them. Other people get angry and honk their horns.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side. A place to help people who are hurt is on the other side. The place has nice furniture outside. A fan moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and play in the grass. Flowers are near the road. Bees are in the flowers.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking near the playground. There is a place to get cheap food. It is near the park. There is a store for swimming pools. A place to get nails done is nearby. You can fill your pool and get a manicure and eat food all at the same time.\n\nThere is a place to get frozen yogurt. The teens like to eat it. They do tricks on their skateboards while eating. The neighborhood is a special part of America. It is a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past many fields of corn. I said, \"This is it!\" I thought she would be surprised. She is from a town where a store is near her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She knew me better then.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water, called a quarry. Next to it is where I live. My house is made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People like to take care of their land. In the spring, there are many flowers and trees that change color with the seasons. The driveways are filled with nice cars that shine in the sun.\n\nAs we continued driving, I saw my neighbor. He is old and always smiles. He mows his grass and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a nice person. He used to be a doctor. Now, he is a little slower. He rides a yellow machine to mow his grass.\n\nWe kept driving and came to my home. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. In the back yard, there is a stream. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. Across a little bridge is a special place. It has naturally growing trees, plants, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood.\n\nI built forts in the trees and played with the other kids. We would chase animals, but they were not real. The winters in my town are very cold. The yard looks empty, and the trees are bare. But when it snows, it is very beautiful. We made snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs to fight. We built big forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own winter wonderland and pretended to be something else. We were happy and did not worry about anything.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The word \"weird\" is important here. \"Keep Portland Weird\" is the unofficial city slogan. It means we like things that are different. Portland was not always like this. It was once a small, less expensive place with creative people. Now, many people from California are moving here. They are changing Portland, but it is still weird. Weird means we accept things that others do not. We have modern things like other cities. We buy things from China. But we also have things that are different, like colorful houses and home gardens.\n\nIn my neighborhood, you can find free boxes. They are boxes with things people are giving away. They might have clothes, books, or other things. You might find something interesting in a free box. This is special about Portland. People here love different things. Some people like yoga with goats, others like soccer. We have many different kinds of people.\n\nPortland has problems, too. Some people have drug problems. This is often because of mental health problems. The rain in Portland can make people feel sad. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland for help, but we do not have enough help. People are not sure what to do about this. Some people care about the homeless, others do not. Portland is a city with many different people and problems. But it is still a weird and special place.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. No matter what, they do not change. They do not get upset. They are there for me when I am stressed. They help me rest my worried mind. They give me strength to keep going.\n\nI moved here for college. The mountains near the university were the first thing I saw. The university has many beautiful things - buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most beautiful to me.\n\nThe town is also very nice. It has many small cafes. People study here for many hours with coffee. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It has old buildings with colorful bricks. The town is like a city, but not too big.\n\nI like it here because it is not too busy. You can walk to the library and be in a quiet place. The town has two very different feelings. It is fun to explore. I have many happy memories here. I walked with friends in the park. I went to the movies in the theater. But I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond and think about my life. I see the turtles, ducks, and insects. They live their lives. I think about my purpose in life. I walk to the main street. The sun shines on the palm trees. I see the sunrise. I see the mountains. They are very big and strong. They make me feel brave.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy to find. Many people use public transportation to get there. It is a busy neighborhood in New York City. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nMany Asian stores are in Bensonhurst. This is because many Asian people live there. You will see a store every few blocks. Supermarkets and laundry stores are popular. These stores are favorite places for local people. Food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to go there.\n\nYou can walk to many stores. Four supermarkets are close to each other. This makes it easy to get what you need.\n\nNot all people in Bensonhurst are Asian. Many people from other countries live there too. Their children are American. Some big stores in the neighborhood are Asian-owned. There is a park near Bensonhurst. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a playground. People with young children like this park.\n\nMost people live in small houses. There are no big office buildings. Some people live in apartments. Many people live in two-family houses.\n\nPeople in Bensonhurst are generally nice. However, they can be noisy. You may hear loud music and fast cars. At night, you need to be careful. Some people may try to cause trouble. There are also thieves. I was bullied years ago. Recently, some people stole packages.\n\nPeople do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the streets. This is a problem for me. Be careful where you walk.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. The streets go downhill quickly. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be hard to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot in our area. Sometimes branches hit the wires and cause problems. The workers fix them, but they look broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people here do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and houses. I left my car outside for a month. When I went to use it, it was covered in green moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near by. Most of the people are old and retired. They have dogs, not kids. You see dogs in people's yards and running in the street. If you leave a door open, a dog might come in. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out. We also have many wild rabbits. They dig up plants and gardens. My cats like them, but the gardeners do not. We see many birds, too. There are small birds and big birds that come by. Sometimes a big bird, like a hawk, comes by. But the crows chase it away. There are no stores near by. But if you walk down the hill, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The area near the water is not very big. You can see the other side of the bay even when it is foggy.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is near two big roads. We get some traffic, but it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do other things every day.\n\nIn the winter, we slide down a hill near our house. We live at the front of our street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. We see the cars they drive. If we see a strange car, we notice it.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters (11 and 14 years old), and me.\n\nWe like to go outside and play. We even play in the rain. We also grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it's cool in the hot sun. But then there are many leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe don't have much winter. It feels like fall is long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work on my truck and other projects there. If I open the garage door, I can hear the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, we see more people from out of town. They park their cars everywhere. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the desert. It is a dry and brown place. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like. When I see a green yard, I know the person takes good care of it. In the past, my neighborhood was quiet and spread out. Now, many new houses are being built. The area looks more like a city now. But, it is the same in many places. People here are friendly, but like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near many older people who are kind. This is a good neighborhood. We have common stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy organic food, you must go somewhere else. My town has many construction jobs. The city is not fully developed, and there is much empty space to build. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like my job. Many people like the desert because of its beauty. It is a challenging place for animals and humans to live. We must learn about the animals that live here to live safely. My family and I like the animals. We have three children who like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. There are things to do in our town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. If you come, try to visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and go skiing. If you like history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has objects that tell us about the desert's history and people.",
            "My neighborhood is different. I do not live in a regular neighborhood. I live on a college campus. My home is a dormitory, and my community is the people who live with me in the dorm. I also consider the whole campus to be my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and a park. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on the campus. First, there are apartments. These are big buildings with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each floor has 20 people living there. \n\nSecond, there are houses for rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are usually lived in by alumni. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in dorm rooms. Each room has two people. There are many dorm rooms on campus.\n\nMy neighborhood is a good place for people from different countries and ages. The staff live in houses, and the students live in dorms or apartments. The students who are new to the campus live in dorms, and the older students live in apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about stores and parks. The campus has many stores. They sell food, clothes, and other things. The campus has one park. It is a place for everyone to play. The park is kept clean and safe by the people who live on campus.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We chose this neighborhood for better housing and a good high school.\n\nWhen I first came, I was unhappy. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends and enemies at school. I did not get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are kind people. I consider them like family. I like them.\n\nI remember when Mr. Glen got married. My family and I went to the wedding. It was fun. I caught something thrown by Mr. Glen's wife, but not the flowers! We danced and had a good time. I liked dancing with one of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well.\n\nOur neighborhood is a little confusing. But I have a GPS now. I like to explore. I have been with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm. I like to find sticks and practice my balance. Sometimes I bring my wooden sword.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. We had fun, but they made us work hard! I like to have the court, in case I want to play again.\n\nI have had many happy times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near my college. I like this area. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants, and bars. The restaurants and bars are fun and not very expensive. One bar is new. It is more expensive but good. Many people are nice. They are students or have low income because the apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near my home. There are many children. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. My building manager put a special air cleaner near their door. I find this funny. \n\nMy building is old but nice inside. New apartments are across the street. They look good but are not safe. The construction is bad. The rent is high. I do not like this. There is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. They microwave most of the food. Opposite the restaurant is a gas station. I hear it is not a good place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road last summer. Now it is nice. There are sidewalks, grass, and trees. But my building is very green because of the trees. The trees block some sunlight. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment building. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. There is crime on this street. But it is not just one building's problem. Other buildings across the street have crime too. I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. I like that my college is near and there are buses to take me to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has many houses on a closed street. They look like separate homes. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most people in my neighborhood are friends with each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk. Children play outside with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites.\n\nIt is nice to live here. It is like going back in time in a busy world. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and white clouds are moving. It is beautiful.\n\nBut we also have problems. We had a warning for a big storm. Last night, we heard a siren and had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. We heard big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was very hot. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow.\n\nI took pictures of the rainbow and showed them to my friends on the computer. They were very happy. The street was quiet for a while. Then people came home from where they were. It was business as usual. We had dinner and mothers and children were outside.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. It looks the same as the other houses outside, but they are different inside. Some apartments are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and a big frog that sings in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. I wake up every morning to the sound of roosters. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening.\n\nI am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood in eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends. But I got close to two people: one lives two houses down from me, and the other lives on my street. They do not live here now, but I still remember them.\n\nThe people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. I hear children playing outside on weekends and warm days.\n\nMy neighborhood is quiet. I have never had problems with the people here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have bought things online many times, and no one has taken them from my porch.\n\nI trust my neighbors. A park is near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt once playing football, but I remember the good times more.\n\nNow, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me. They like to play on swings and slides. They are happy when we go to the park.\n\nMy neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby. But many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash now.\n\nThere are many stores near my house. You can find everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. One store is Indian-owned, and it has Indian food.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I see bad stories about neighbors on social media and news. I am grateful for my neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is a quiet place. But it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is very proud of this. Many people grow peaches here. They also raise cattle. The town has many fields with peach trees and cows.\n\nMost houses are in the country. They are far apart. They are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. Many houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the front fields for animals and crops.\n\nIn the town, there is a traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to get fast food. You can eat at Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant. Or you can eat at Fiesta Mexican Restaurant or Gary's burger shop.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town where you can buy most things. But people often go to Walmart in the next town to buy groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things you need every day. People go there often. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver furniture to your home. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThere are two small medical offices in the next part of the town. One is for a doctor and the other is for a veterinarian. There is a small elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in the next town.\n\nThere is no park in the town yet. But they are building a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big. This will give people a place to go and play. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or restaurants in the town. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I first heard about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. I was surprised. The cost of apartments there is very high. Many are over one thousand dollars a month. I never heard about this story. Neither did my friends. We have a hard time making money. Sometimes people are sad and cry at night. But we have learned how to save money. We buy things at second-hand stores. We like the smell of old toys and clothes. When you are a grown-up, you smell less. You might smoke or get used to the way things are. But the second-hand stores are always there. They have a strong smell. It comes from old magazines on a piano. You can't get rid of it even if you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. You can walk there. If you start at one end, you can visit a library, a store with rare books, and a store with strange things. The streets are crowded in the city. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But the stores are quiet. You can't hear the noise. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. More and more people visit the city each year. It's a growing city. One of the biggest online companies in the world is here. The city still has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask each other many questions. You can be alone if you want. The city will leave you alone. This is different from the South. In the South, people ask about each other's lives.\n\nI like my home. It's not a place of strangers. It's a community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays together. We help each other when we need it. I have kind neighbors. I try to clean after myself. I leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I feel lucky to live here.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood. It is like many other places. My neighborhood has a homeowners group. They help keep everything in order. Every house is very clean and nice. The lawns are small and have pretty stones. Many houses have two cars in the garage. The streets are new and smooth. You will not see any big holes.\n\nMost houses are one story. But some are two stories. We do not have boxes in front of each house for mail. We have one box with many small boxes inside. You need a key to get your mail. The neighborhood is on the edge of the city. It is part nature and part city. We have a lot of space. We have two swimming pools and many paths to walk on.\n\nMany people in the neighborhood are old and retired. But we also have people in the middle of their lives. Everyone takes care of each other. The neighborhood is safe. Our city is big but feels small. We have many stores. We have a big mall with many stores. It takes 15 minutes to drive to the mall. When we get there, we can buy many things. We have stores with healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nIn general, my neighborhood is good. It is safe and clean. We have many nice things like pools and paths. If we want to go to a big store, we just need to drive a little.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the country. My town is near a big city, but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not a rich area. Many people in my neighborhood rent their houses. They have low incomes. However, my neighborhood is not ugly. My neighbors are kind and say hello when I walk by. There are some crimes in my neighborhood. But they are not many. Some people were hurt by guns in the past. One person died. But my family has not been hurt. Sometimes we leave things on our porch, and they disappear. This town has a big problem. Many people have died from bad medicine. The medicine is called fentanyl. There are many places to help people with this problem. There are places to help people stop using bad medicine. Some people teach others how to save lives with a special medicine called Narcan. My son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and help him. My son has special needs, but he is safe at school. He likes his school. We have a group that helps the school. They plan events to help families and make learning better. Many children in our town are very poor. So, the school gives them free food every day. No child has to be hungry. The city government has made the town look better. They fixed roads, planted flowers, and fixed the parks. But they did most of this work in the middle of town and on the west side. The west side has shops and traffic. My neighborhood is on the east side, and it is not as nice. This makes some people unhappy. I like living in this town. People are kind, schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is comfortable.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are here. I live in a 7-story apartment house near an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar with games. People like to go there on warm summer nights. There is often a line of people waiting to get in.\n\nNearby is a city park. It is very big for this part of town. The park has a lot of concrete and tall stairs. In cold weather, homeless people put up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. It is not very snowy here, but it rains a lot. Heavy rain in winter can make it hard to stay warm. The people put their tents close together. This keeps them warmer. They are near a place where they can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not the old buildings that I like. I like the people. My neighborhood used to be very bad. There was a lot of gang violence. Many years ago, government officials and police came to clean the streets. The people remember this. They tell stories about it. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city.\n\nSome people say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is not true. I am not sure why they say this. Maybe it is because I am not white. Maybe the people here know me. I feel at home here. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where I feel safe.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. You can see farmland and small cities. There are no big shopping malls. We do not have a Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. When we want to go somewhere, we drive. I live in a beautiful place near two big lakes. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are on my town's sides. We can swim in the lakes. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not very close together. They are old and different from each other. Some houses are new and some are old. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. We have houses in many colors. Most houses have yards. The yards have trampolines, playsets, and gardens. People take care of their lawns. They mow the grass and trim the bushes. We see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. We know our neighbors. We can tell who is new and who is not. We see people grilling outside and say hello. We also see people walking their dogs and smiling. Our neighborhood is quiet and safe. It is a good place to live. We have a sheriff's department, a health department, and a recycling center nearby. We also have baseball and softball fields. We can hear the announcers calling the games. Our town has a small airport. We can hear the planes taking off and landing. We can walk to get ice cream and to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is different. There are many kinds of homes. Some are near businesses, like stores and restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are popular too. They are on the street and in shopping centers. People like to walk to these stores. There are parks near my home. I see families with young children in these parks. My neighborhood is also different. We have people from many countries and with different lifestyles. We have a special community for people who love each other in a different way. We also have a community for Jewish people and for people who came from a country called the Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different countries and races. We have neighborhoods for Korean people, Chinese people, and Armenian people. These neighborhoods are just a few miles away. But driving to these places can be hard. The roads are very busy. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially in the morning and evening. Not many people walk in my city. We like to drive instead. It is hard to find a parking spot. The city is growing. New buildings are being built. More people are moving in. Some people are not happy about this. They do not want more cars on the road. There are many kinds of homes in my city. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are small buildings with just a few families. This is true in my neighborhood too. I am not friends with most of my neighbors. We are not a close community. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors and we were friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Many houses are for one family. Some homes have been changed into two, but they are still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small drive on the left side. It looks like a place many people thought was the American dream a long time ago. This dream seemed good for many Americans. But now, it is not as popular. People still live in my neighborhood and other neighborhoods like it. They remind us that the dream is still alive. People take care of their yards less now. But there are still cars in every drive and children play outside. The public school is old – almost 90 years. It still shows children a future. It also makes older people think about the past. There are few churches and they are not full. But the basketball courts are busy. All the houses are different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are maybe the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. Cars can pass easily. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They know each other. There was a karate school, but it closed. Kids stopped going because they didn't want to be like the Karate Kid anymore. Now it is a pharmacy. Drugs make people feel better, so they think. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people don't like it because they want to see new movies. But older people think it's a good deal. They can see a movie without the kids. There is one highway that goes through our town. But the highway has entrances and exits in the next town. We used to want a highway in our town, but older people said it would ruin our town. They convinced the city to say no. We are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not see it at first. It is behind a shopping place. People do not usually think there are homes there. But if you look closely, you will find a big community. There are many apartments in a row. Some of these apartments have had bad news. We will not talk about those.\n\nThe other apartments are nice. People do not know much about them. Across from these apartments is a small college. Students go there. They are sleepy in the morning. The gates creak open for them. Other people get angry and honk their horns.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side. A place to help people who are hurt is on the other side. The place has nice furniture outside. A fan moves the air. Children play in the park. They run and play in the grass. Flowers are near the road. Bees are in the flowers.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking near the playground. There is a place to get cheap food. It is near the park. There is a store for swimming pools. A place to get nails done is nearby. You can fill your pool and get a manicure and eat food all at the same time.\n\nThere is a place to get frozen yogurt. The teens like to eat it. They do tricks on their skateboards while eating. The neighborhood is a special part of America. It is a quiet place where not much changes.",
            "She asked, \"Where are we?\" as we drove past many fields of corn. I said, \"This is it!\" I thought she would be surprised. She is from a town where a store is near her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She knew me better then.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water, called a quarry. Next to it is where I live. My house is made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People like to take care of their land. In the spring, there are many flowers and trees that change color with the seasons. The driveways are filled with nice cars that shine in the sun.\n\nAs we continued driving, I saw my neighbor. He is old and always smiles. He mows his grass and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a nice person. He used to be a doctor. Now, he is a little slower. He rides a yellow machine to mow his grass.\n\nWe kept driving and came to my home. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. In the back yard, there is a stream. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. Across a little bridge is a special place. It has naturally growing trees, plants, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood.\n\nI built forts in the trees and played with the other kids. We would chase animals, but they were not real. The winters in my town are very cold. The yard looks empty, and the trees are bare. But when it snows, it is very beautiful. We made snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs to fight. We built big forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own winter wonderland and pretended to be something else. We were happy and did not worry about anything.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The word \"weird\" is important here. \"Keep Portland Weird\" is the unofficial city slogan. It means we like things that are different. Portland was not always like this. It was once a small, less expensive place with creative people. Now, many people from California are moving here. They are changing Portland, but it is still weird. Weird means we accept things that others do not. We have modern things like other cities. We buy things from China. But we also have things that are different, like colorful houses and home gardens.\n\nIn my neighborhood, you can find free boxes. They are boxes with things people are giving away. They might have clothes, books, or other things. You might find something interesting in a free box. This is special about Portland. People here love different things. Some people like yoga with goats, others like soccer. We have many different kinds of people.\n\nPortland has problems, too. Some people have drug problems. This is often because of mental health problems. The rain in Portland can make people feel sad. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland for help, but we do not have enough help. People are not sure what to do about this. Some people care about the homeless, others do not. Portland is a city with many different people and problems. But it is still a weird and special place.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. No matter what, they do not change. They do not get upset. They are there for me when I am stressed. They help me rest my worried mind. They give me strength to keep going.\n\nI moved here for college. The mountains near the university were the first thing I saw. The university has many beautiful things - buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most beautiful to me.\n\nThe town is also very nice. It has many small cafes. People study here for many hours with coffee. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It has old buildings with colorful bricks. The town is like a city, but not too big.\n\nI like it here because it is not too busy. You can walk to the library and be in a quiet place. The town has two very different feelings. It is fun to explore. I have many happy memories here. I walked with friends in the park. I went to the movies in the theater. But I also have sad memories. Sometimes I go to the pond and think about my life. I see the turtles, ducks, and insects. They live their lives. I think about my purpose in life. I walk to the main street. The sun shines on the palm trees. I see the sunrise. I see the mountains. They are very big and strong. They make me feel brave.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy to find. Many people use public transportation to get there. It is a busy neighborhood in New York City. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nMany Asian stores are in Bensonhurst. This is because many Asian people live there. You will see a store every few blocks. Supermarkets and laundry stores are popular. These stores are favorite places for local people. Food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to go there.\n\nYou can walk to many stores. Four supermarkets are close to each other. This makes it easy to get what you need.\n\nNot all people in Bensonhurst are Asian. Many people from other countries live there too. Their children are American. Some big stores in the neighborhood are Asian-owned. There is a park near Bensonhurst. It has basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, and a playground. People with young children like this park.\n\nMost people live in small houses. There are no big office buildings. Some people live in apartments. Many people live in two-family houses.\n\nPeople in Bensonhurst are generally nice. However, they can be noisy. You may hear loud music and fast cars. At night, you need to be careful. Some people may try to cause trouble. There are also thieves. I was bullied years ago. Recently, some people stole packages.\n\nPeople do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the streets. This is a problem for me. Be careful where you walk.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. The streets go downhill quickly. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be hard to drive on. Telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot in our area. Sometimes branches hit the wires and cause problems. The workers fix them, but they look broken. There are many tall trees everywhere. But people here do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and houses. I left my car outside for a month. When I went to use it, it was covered in green moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near by. Most of the people are old and retired. They have dogs, not kids. You see dogs in people's yards and running in the street. If you leave a door open, a dog might come in. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out. We also have many wild rabbits. They dig up plants and gardens. My cats like them, but the gardeners do not. We see many birds, too. There are small birds and big birds that come by. Sometimes a big bird, like a hawk, comes by. But the crows chase it away. There are no stores near by. But if you walk down the hill, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The area near the water is not very big. You can see the other side of the bay even when it is foggy.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is near two big roads. We get some traffic, but it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do other things every day.\n\nIn the winter, we slide down a hill near our house. We live at the front of our street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. We see the cars they drive. If we see a strange car, we notice it.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters (11 and 14 years old), and me.\n\nWe like to go outside and play. We even play in the rain. We also grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it's cool in the hot sun. But then there are many leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe don't have much winter. It feels like fall is long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work on my truck and other projects there. If I open the garage door, I can hear the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, we see more people from out of town. They park their cars everywhere. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the desert. It is a dry and brown place. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like. When I see a green yard, I know the person takes good care of it. In the past, my neighborhood was quiet and spread out. Now, many new houses are being built. The area looks more like a city now. But, it is the same in many places. People here are friendly, but like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near many older people who are kind. This is a good neighborhood. We have common stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy organic food, you must go somewhere else. My town has many construction jobs. The city is not fully developed, and there is much empty space to build. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like my job. Many people like the desert because of its beauty. It is a challenging place for animals and humans to live. We must learn about the animals that live here to live safely. My family and I like the animals. We have three children who like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. There are things to do in our town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. If you come, try to visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and go skiing. If you like history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has objects that tell us about the desert's history and people.",
            "My neighborhood is different. I do not live in a regular neighborhood. I live on a college campus. My home is a dormitory, and my community is the people who live with me in the dorm. I also consider the whole campus to be my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and a park. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on the campus. First, there are apartments. These are big buildings with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each floor has 20 people living there. \n\nSecond, there are houses for rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. They are usually lived in by alumni. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in dorm rooms. Each room has two people. There are many dorm rooms on campus.\n\nMy neighborhood is a good place for people from different countries and ages. The staff live in houses, and the students live in dorms or apartments. The students who are new to the campus live in dorms, and the older students live in apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about stores and parks. The campus has many stores. They sell food, clothes, and other things. The campus has one park. It is a place for everyone to play. The park is kept clean and safe by the people who live on campus.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We chose this neighborhood for better housing and a good high school.\n\nWhen I first came, I was unhappy. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends and enemies at school. I did not get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are kind people. I consider them like family. I like them.\n\nI remember when Mr. Glen got married. My family and I went to the wedding. It was fun. I caught something thrown by Mr. Glen's wife, but not the flowers! We danced and had a good time. I liked dancing with one of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well.\n\nOur neighborhood is a little confusing. But I have a GPS now. I like to explore. I have been with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm. I like to find sticks and practice my balance. Sometimes I bring my wooden sword.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. We had fun, but they made us work hard! I like to have the court, in case I want to play again.\n\nI have had many happy times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near my college. I like this area. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants, and bars. The restaurants and bars are fun and not very expensive. One bar is new. It is more expensive but good. Many people are nice. They are students or have low income because the apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near my home. There are many children. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot. My building manager put a special air cleaner near their door. I find this funny. \n\nMy building is old but nice inside. New apartments are across the street. They look good but are not safe. The construction is bad. The rent is high. I do not like this. There is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. They microwave most of the food. Opposite the restaurant is a gas station. I hear it is not a good place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road last summer. Now it is nice. There are sidewalks, grass, and trees. But my building is very green because of the trees. The trees block some sunlight. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment building. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not nice. The sidewalks are bad and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. There is crime on this street. But it is not just one building's problem. Other buildings across the street have crime too. I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. I like that my college is near and there are buses to take me to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has many houses on a closed street. They look like separate homes. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most people in my neighborhood are friends with each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk. Children play outside with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites.\n\nIt is nice to live here. It is like going back in time in a busy world. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and white clouds are moving. It is beautiful.\n\nBut we also have problems. We had a warning for a big storm. Last night, we heard a siren and had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. We heard big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was very hot. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow.\n\nI took pictures of the rainbow and showed them to my friends on the computer. They were very happy. The street was quiet for a while. Then people came home from where they were. It was business as usual. We had dinner and mothers and children were outside.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. It looks the same as the other houses outside, but they are different inside. Some apartments are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and a big frog that sings in the morning. It is a great place to live, near the city of Charlotte. I wake up every morning to the sound of roosters. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening.\n\nI am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood in eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends. But I got close to two people: one lives two houses down from me, and the other lives on my street. They do not live here now, but I still remember them.\n\nThe people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. I hear children playing outside on weekends and warm days.\n\nMy neighborhood is quiet. I have never had problems with the people here. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have bought things online many times, and no one has taken them from my porch.\n\nI trust my neighbors. A park is near my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt once playing football, but I remember the good times more.\n\nNow, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me. They like to play on swings and slides. They are happy when we go to the park.\n\nMy neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food here. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants nearby. But many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash now.\n\nThere are many stores near my house. You can find everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. One store is Indian-owned, and it has Indian food.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I see bad stories about neighbors on social media and news. I am grateful for my neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is a quiet place. But it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is very proud of this. Many people grow peaches here. They also raise cattle. The town has many fields with peach trees and cows.\n\nMost houses are in the country. They are far apart. They are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. Many houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the front fields for animals and crops.\n\nIn the town, there is a traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to get fast food. You can eat at Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant. Or you can eat at Fiesta Mexican Restaurant or Gary's burger shop.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town where you can buy most things. But people often go to Walmart in the next town to buy groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things you need every day. People go there often. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver furniture to your home. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThere are two small medical offices in the next part of the town. One is for a doctor and the other is for a veterinarian. There is a small elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in the next town.\n\nThere is no park in the town yet. But they are building a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big. This will give people a place to go and play. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or restaurants in the town. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I first heard about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. I was surprised. The cost of apartments there is very high. Many are over one thousand dollars a month. I never heard about this story. Neither did my friends. We have a hard time making money. Sometimes people are sad and cry at night. But we have learned how to save money. We buy things at second-hand stores. We like the smell of old toys and clothes. When you are a grown-up, you smell less. You might smoke or get used to the way things are. But the second-hand stores are always there. They have a strong smell. It comes from old magazines on a piano. You can't get rid of it even if you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. You can walk there. If you start at one end, you can visit a library, a store with rare books, and a store with strange things. The streets are crowded in the city. Cars and people are everywhere in the morning. But the stores are quiet. You can't hear the noise. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon. More and more people visit the city each year. It's a growing city. One of the biggest online companies in the world is here. The city still has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask each other many questions. You can be alone if you want. The city will leave you alone. This is different from the South. In the South, people ask about each other's lives.\n\nI like my home. It's not a place of strangers. It's a community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays together. We help each other when we need it. I have kind neighbors. I try to clean after myself. I leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I feel lucky to live here.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood. It is like many other places. My neighborhood has a homeowners group. They help keep everything in order. Every house is very clean and nice. The lawns are small and have pretty stones. Many houses have two cars in the garage. The streets are new and smooth. You will not see any big holes.\n\nMost houses are one story. But some are two stories. We do not have boxes in front of each house for mail. We have one box with many small boxes inside. You need a key to get your mail. The neighborhood is on the edge of the city. It is part nature and part city. We have a lot of space. We have two swimming pools and many paths to walk on.\n\nMany people in the neighborhood are old and retired. But we also have people in the middle of their lives. Everyone takes care of each other. The neighborhood is safe. Our city is big but feels small. We have many stores. We have a big mall with many stores. It takes 15 minutes to drive to the mall. When we get there, we can buy many things. We have stores with healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nIn general, my neighborhood is good. It is safe and clean. We have many nice things like pools and paths. If we want to go to a big store, we just need to drive a little.",
            "I live in a small town in the middle of the country. My town is near a big city, but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not a rich area. Many people in my neighborhood rent their houses. They have low incomes. However, my neighborhood is not ugly. My neighbors are kind and say hello when I walk by. There are some crimes in my neighborhood. But they are not many. Some people were hurt by guns in the past. One person died. But my family has not been hurt. Sometimes we leave things on our porch, and they disappear. This town has a big problem. Many people have died from bad medicine. The medicine is called fentanyl. There are many places to help people with this problem. There are places to help people stop using bad medicine. Some people teach others how to save lives with a special medicine called Narcan. My son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind and help him. My son has special needs, but he is safe at school. He likes his school. We have a group that helps the school. They plan events to help families and make learning better. Many children in our town are very poor. So, the school gives them free food every day. No child has to be hungry. The city government has made the town look better. They fixed roads, planted flowers, and fixed the parks. But they did most of this work in the middle of town and on the west side. The west side has shops and traffic. My neighborhood is on the east side, and it is not as nice. This makes some people unhappy. I like living in this town. People are kind, schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is comfortable.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are here. I live in a 7-story apartment house near an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar with games. People like to go there on warm summer nights. There is often a line of people waiting to get in.\n\nNearby is a city park. It is very big for this part of town. The park has a lot of concrete and tall stairs. In cold weather, homeless people put up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. It is not very snowy here, but it rains a lot. Heavy rain in winter can make it hard to stay warm. The people put their tents close together. This keeps them warmer. They are near a place where they can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not the old buildings that I like. I like the people. My neighborhood used to be very bad. There was a lot of gang violence. Many years ago, government officials and police came to clean the streets. The people remember this. They tell stories about it. They work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their city.\n\nSome people say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is not true. I am not sure why they say this. Maybe it is because I am not white. Maybe the people here know me. I feel at home here. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where I feel safe.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. You can see farmland and small cities. There are no big shopping malls. We do not have a Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee's. When we want to go somewhere, we drive. I live in a beautiful place near two big lakes. Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix are on my town's sides. We can swim in the lakes. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not very close together. They are old and different from each other. Some houses are new and some are old. Most houses have basements. You can see them from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. We have houses in many colors. Most houses have yards. The yards have trampolines, playsets, and gardens. People take care of their lawns. They mow the grass and trim the bushes. We see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. We know our neighbors. We can tell who is new and who is not. We see people grilling outside and say hello. We also see people walking their dogs and smiling. Our neighborhood is quiet and safe. It is a good place to live. We have a sheriff's department, a health department, and a recycling center nearby. We also have baseball and softball fields. We can hear the announcers calling the games. Our town has a small airport. We can hear the planes taking off and landing. We can walk to get ice cream and to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. There are houses and offices near each other. Some buildings are office buildings, some are stores, and some are restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small shops. These small shops are popular. They are in shopping malls and on streets. The streets are near neighborhoods that are quiet and nice. There are parks near my neighborhood. Many people go to these parks with their small children. My neighborhood is very diverse. We have many different kinds of people. In one place, we have a big LGBTQ+ community. We also have an Orthodox Jewish community and people from the Soviet Union. There are many other communities in the city. We have areas called Korea town and China town. We also have Little Armenia. These areas are not far from my neighborhood. But the drive can be long because of traffic. It can take a long time to drive a short distance. Many people in my city do not walk. They prefer to drive or take a car. The city is very big, and traffic is bad. It is hard to find parking spaces. Recently, the city has been building many new apartment buildings. This makes some people happy, but others are not. They do not want more people and more cars. There are many kinds of houses in my city. People live in big apartment buildings, small houses, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of houses. People of all ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. The neighborhood is not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts, connected together. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the side. It looks like the suburbs of America a long time ago. That time was the American dream. Many people wanted to live like this. But now the dream is not as strong. My neighborhood reminds people that the dream is still alive. People visit my neighborhood and see that the dream is still real. The people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside like the world is their own. The local school has been here for almost 90 years. It still shows children their future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing when cars come. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But children stopped going because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. The younger people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one highway that passes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next door. We used to want to have our own entrance and exit. The younger people wanted it, but the older people said no. They said it would ruin our town. Now they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People do not usually think of it as a place to live. But if you go behind an old building and walk down the road, you will see a busy community. There are many apartments here. They are next to each other, like boxes in a line.\n\nSome of the apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about those. The other apartments are a different story. Almost no one knows about them. Across from the apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They wake up early in the morning and go to class with coffee in their hands. The gates open slowly to let them in. Cars drive by quickly, and people shake their fists at the students for slowing them down.\n\nThe road splits into two. There is a park on one side and a building where people go to get better after breaking a bone. The building has nice furniture on the porch. There is a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people skateboarding. The young people laugh and talk about their friends.\n\nThere is a place to eat sushi and a store that sells swimming things. There is also a place to get a manicure and a swimming pool. You can get food, a manicure, and fill your pool all at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt. Young people like to eat there while they skateboard and use a special device to breathe in the air.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet area where not much changes.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is my home,\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the big open space. She came from a town where a grocery store was near her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. I could see it in her eyes. She finally understood where I was from.\n\nWe drove down a small country road. There was a big water-filled hole on one side. Just after that was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They each have a big piece of land. Everyone takes care of their land.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers are planted and trees with different colors change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine after being washed.\n\nAs we drove, I pointed to my house. My neighbor was outside. He is a kind Korean man. He spends the day mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him, but he is also a very interesting person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and not as funny. He still has a special face.\n\nWe arrived at my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind the house, there is a stream that feeds into the water hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes animals from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge, there is a special place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That is where I grew up. I built forts in the trees and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nIn the winter, it is very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees that were green are now bare. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I used to make snowmen and snow angels. We had a lot of fun. We even made forts to fight with snowballs.\n\nThis was a special place for us to play. We didn't worry about anything. We were just two happy kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a strange city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place where people are free to be different. Some people like this because it reminds them of Portland in the 1990s and early 2000s. That Portland was a smaller city with lower costs. It had many creative and unique cultures. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a call to come to the city. Here, people will still think you are strange, but it is a compliment.\n\nMany people from California are moving to Portland. This is changing the city. New homes are being built for them. But Portland is still strange. Strange does not mean the city does not have modern things. We buy many things from China like the rest of the country. We have normal things too. We have yoga, hipster shops, and business people.\n\nPerhaps being weird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens with flowers and food. In the summer, we have free boxes. These are boxes with things that people are giving away. You can find good things in these boxes. They can have clothes, books, or anything.\n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland can be magical. This is what Portland is about to me. But I am only one of many people who like Portland. Some people I live with would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to yoga with goats or watch the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is full of people who like different things. Some people are trying to achieve their dreams. Others are drinking too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. This problem often comes from mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies also contribute to the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. The city's services are not enough to help everyone. People who are not homeless are divided. Some people care about the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not unique to Portland.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They do not mind what people do. They are strong and steady. When I am stressed and sad, the mountains help me. They make me feel better. They give me the strength to go on.\n\nI moved to this town when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing I saw and liked. The university has nice buildings and a pond and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied for a long time. I can walk or take the bus to the city center. It is old and has a lot of history. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is busy, but it is not too busy.\n\nI can escape the city by going to the library. It is a small town with a quiet atmosphere. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It makes me feel calm, but it also makes me think about my life. I have good memories and bad memories here. I like walking in the park with my friends. I like going to the movies in the city. I also have sad times here. I like to walk by the pond and think about my life. I see turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want to do.\n\nI walk by the pond and the park and the houses. I reach the main street. The sun shines brightly. I see the mountains in the north. They are strong and high. They make me feel like I can do anything. They make me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is very good. Bensonhurst is a part of New York City, so you will still feel like you are in the city. When you visit, you will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. Because of this, you see an Asian-owned store on almost every street. These stores are often supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to shop. I live near four Asian supermarkets. They are all close to each other, within two minutes of walking. This is very convenient for buying groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a diverse neighborhood with many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses in the neighborhood are owned by Asian people. There is also a park near where I live. It has many things for people to do, like basketball courts, a soccer field, and swings for kids. People of all kinds play together in the park.\n\nThere are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most of the buildings are for people who live in apartments or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this neighborhood are generally nice. However, it can be noisy. Cars often drive by with loud music. People also drive quickly and loudly. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I had a bad experience in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But many people do not do this in Bensonhurst. You often see dog waste on the street. My big complaint is the dog waste. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "In the place where I live, there are not many sidewalks. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many runners go there to exercise every day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is rough and not very safe to drive on in some places.\n\nMany telephone and electric wires are above the street. They look old and damaged because strong winds often knock them down. People fix them often, but they still look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. However, people don't like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nThe weather is often cloudy. Most days are overcast and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. I had to spend three hours cleaning it. There are not many children in my area. Most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. Dogs are common in the neighborhood. You often see them in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it outside.\n\nWild rabbits live in the area. They are big and like to dig in gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We have a few stores near the water, but if you walk downhill, you can find more restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but casting stones into the water is fun. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is in a quiet neighborhood. It is between two big roads, so we see some traffic. Most people do their work in their yards and daily tasks. I know most of my neighbors. They like to walk and exercise their dogs. Children ride their bicycles. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife and I, and our two daughters, ten and fourteen years old. This means we see our neighbors often.\n\nWe like to play outside. We even play in the rain. We sometimes grill food on our back porch. It smells good. Many people cut their grass. We hear a lot of lawn mowers from March to October.\n\nOur neighborhood is surrounded by trees. This means it is cool and shady. But in the fall, we have a lot of leaves. We must clean them up. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe do not have much winter. It seems like fall is very long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work in the garage on my truck and other projects. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to my neighbors.\n\nOn holidays, it is quiet. Some families visit from other places on Thanksgiving and other special days. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. The only thing I do not like is that our street is a through street.",
            "My home is in a dry desert area. It is very hot. The ground is brown. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it means the owner works very hard to keep it green. I have lived here since the 1990s. The houses were far apart. Now, more people have moved in. The area looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. The people here are friendly. But, like in any city, some people are nice and some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are friendly. The stores here are like big chain stores. They sell food and other things. There are no special stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy food from a special store, you must travel far. The main jobs here are in construction. Many people build houses and buildings. This is because the area is not fully developed. It has many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install walls and bars. One good thing about my home is the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many types of animals and plants. It is hard to protect the desert, but we must. We must learn about the animals that live here. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some good places to visit. Victorville is a good place for families. You can see the desert and do fun things. If you come, visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum is interesting. It has rocks and old bones from the desert. It also has things from Native American people and old objects that tell us about the history of Victorville. If you like the desert and its history, visit the museum.",
            "I live in a college campus. This is my neighborhood. I live in a dormitory with many people. The people who live in my dorm are my community. I also think of the campus and buildings around my dorm as my neighborhood. \n\nMy neighborhood has many things like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses. \n\nFirst, there are apartments. Two to four people live in each room. Each floor has four to six rooms. So, 20 people live in each building. \n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. They have two to four bedrooms. Alumni usually live in these houses. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. Two people usually share a room. This is the most common kind of housing in my neighborhood. \n\nLet's talk about the people. My school likes diversity. The neighborhood has people from many countries and ages. Staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Old students live in apartments. \n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores sell food, school clothes, and groceries. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. At first, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. I missed my old home. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. We have a new, safer home now. We also have a better high school. I made some new friends and some new enemies in school. I knew a few neighbors very well. Mr. Glen and his family are nice. They live next door to us. I like them. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a piece of his wife's shoe when she took it off! I also danced a lot. A girl from Mr. Glen's family, Marsharii, is a friend. I don't see her now.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I like to walk in the park. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I have a wooden sword and like to play with it. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time.\n\nI have many happy memories here. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. They are students or low-income people. They live here because the rent is not high. There is an elementary school close to my home. Many children live here. I don't know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My apartment building put a special air cleaner near their door. It makes the air smell good. I think it's funny.\n\nThe buildings near me are old. But they may have new inside. There are new apartments down the street. But I don't like them. They are not well built. The rent is high. I think it's not fair. Many people live in these buildings because they are near the campus. Across the street from my home is a cheap restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near the restaurant. I heard it's a bad place to work. The city gave money to fix the road near my home. Now the sidewalk is wide and there is grass on the side of the road. The area is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down. But I like the trees near my home.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad. The buildings look old and dirty. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. Most crimes happen at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I don't blame them alone. There are other apartments on my street that have problems. There are many trees on my street. I like living here. It's affordable. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses. They look like separate houses because they are far apart. Each house is yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. People here are friendly. They like to talk to each other. On some evenings, we stand in our driveways and visit. Our children play outside with toys and chalk. We enjoy this. It is a good feeling in a world with many machines. It feels like the past.\n\nOur neighborhood has fields, trees, and blue skies. We see white clouds. This is nice. But sometimes we have bad weather. We had a big storm. We heard a warning and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The storm was loud. We heard hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. We saw a rainbow. I took pictures.\n\nThe streets were quiet after the storm. People finally came home. We had dinner together. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. Our apartments are the same on the outside, but different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer. In the morning, I hear a frog singing. It is a good place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters singing. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard at first. I became friends with two people who lived nearby. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. The same people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American neighborhoods. There are many houses with two floors. I often hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. If you need help, people will help you. I have ordered packages online many times without any problems. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad because it reminds me of good times. My neighborhood is very different from others because it has many types of food. We have Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near us. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and many pizza shops. You can find everything you need at the stores. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store on the same street. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am thankful for my good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town signs say. \n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. They are not near the road. They are in the fields. \n\nIn the town, there is one traffic light. This is where people buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for Cherry Coca-Cola. \n\nThere is one small grocery store called IGA. People go there to buy a few things. Most people go to a bigger store in a nearby town to buy their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. It is always busy. There is a small furniture store. The woman who runs it is kind. She has two men to help deliver the furniture. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets. They cut their hair and take care of them. \n\nThere is a small school for little kids. When they grow up, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. It will have a place for kids to play and people to walk their dogs. The town is small. People can walk by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast about people who disappeared. This surprised me. Many apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I never heard of this story and neither did my friends. We are struggling. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we learned to save money. We like old toys and old clothes. We smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke or get used to things. The flea market is always there. It smells like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean the piano.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The area is crowded, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore people and cars come here every year. It's a growing city. A big company that sells things online is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet. You can keep your private life. The city is lively. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a good community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind and I like them. We help each other.\n\nI live in a big apartment building, but my neighbors make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is very clean and nice. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep it that way. The houses are all the same. They are single family homes with small yards. The yards have grass and small stones. There is a short driveway. Everyone has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. You will not see holes in the road.\n\nMost houses are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have a special box for mail in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. My neighborhood is like a mix of a small town and the country. We have a lot of space. We have several swimming pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. We also have paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things that people usually need, like a big store with many things inside. It takes 15 minutes to drive to anywhere important. When you get there, you can find many stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and paths. We are not close to big shopping, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area has low property values. Many people live here because they cannot afford to live in other parts of town. They rent or own small houses. My neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. However, it is still not bad. There have been a few violent crimes near my home. These include some shootings and one murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Fortunately, we have not had any big problems with crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we leave them outside. A big problem in our town is the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. We have places to help people with addiction. These include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends. Despite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son is happy there. The school takes care of children with special needs. He has no problems at school. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. We do not have to worry about our son going hungry. The city is making our town better. They have fixed roads and parks. However, they have done more work on the other side of town. Our side needs more help. This is a problem for us. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores for our needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a big apartment building. It is across from an old theater. There is a fun bar a short walk away. People like to go there on warm summer nights. \n\nWhen it is cold, people who do not have homes sleep near the city park. The park is big. It has concrete and stairs around it. People can walk to the park from my building. They can also walk to a place where they can bathe and get warm.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the people. It used to be a bad place. Many years ago, there was a lot of violence. The government tried to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. I think this is like the past. It makes me think about racism and unfair ideas. I like my neighborhood because the people are kind. They help each other. I have walked the streets at night and met many people. They have helped me when I needed it. I feel happy in my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a place where you can see a lot of farmland and small cities. There are no big stores like Walmart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. I live near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. The water is very beautiful. My town is also surrounded by water. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to play in.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not very close to each other. They are older homes, some new and some old. Many houses have basements that you can see from the road. Some houses have aluminum siding and some have different colors. Most houses have yards with toys and gardens. People take care of their lawns and keep them clean.\n\nPeople in this town work hard to make a living. They are good people who raise their families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. Neighbors know each other and are friendly. If you see someone grilling or walking their dog, you can wave and say hello. The lawns are neat and clean. You can tell it is a safe place to live.\n\nThere is a police station and a jail near my house. We also have a place to recycle and a baseball field where you can hear the announcers. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying overhead. Our ice cream shop is close by too. You can walk to the park and ride your bike to the ice cream store. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. There are houses and offices near each other. Some buildings are office buildings, some are stores, and some are restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small shops. These small shops are popular. They are in shopping malls and on streets. The streets are near neighborhoods that are quiet and nice. There are parks near my neighborhood. Many people go to these parks with their small children. My neighborhood is very diverse. We have many different kinds of people. In one place, we have a big LGBTQ+ community. We also have an Orthodox Jewish community and people from the Soviet Union. There are many other communities in the city. We have areas called Korea town and China town. We also have Little Armenia. These areas are not far from my neighborhood. But the drive can be long because of traffic. It can take a long time to drive a short distance. Many people in my city do not walk. They prefer to drive or take a car. The city is very big, and traffic is bad. It is hard to find parking spaces. Recently, the city has been building many new apartment buildings. This makes some people happy, but others are not. They do not want more people and more cars. There are many kinds of houses in my city. People live in big apartment buildings, small houses, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of houses. People of all ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. The neighborhood is not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts, connected together. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the side. It looks like the suburbs of America a long time ago. That time was the American dream. Many people wanted to live like this. But now the dream is not as strong. My neighborhood reminds people that the dream is still alive. People visit my neighborhood and see that the dream is still real. The people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside like the world is their own. The local school has been here for almost 90 years. It still shows children their future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing when cars come. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But children stopped going because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. The younger people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one highway that passes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next door. We used to want to have our own entrance and exit. The younger people wanted it, but the older people said no. They said it would ruin our town. Now they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People do not usually think of it as a place to live. But if you go behind an old building and walk down the road, you will see a busy community. There are many apartments here. They are next to each other, like boxes in a line.\n\nSome of the apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about those. The other apartments are a different story. Almost no one knows about them. Across from the apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They wake up early in the morning and go to class with coffee in their hands. The gates open slowly to let them in. Cars drive by quickly, and people shake their fists at the students for slowing them down.\n\nThe road splits into two. There is a park on one side and a building where people go to get better after breaking a bone. The building has nice furniture on the porch. There is a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people skateboarding. The young people laugh and talk about their friends.\n\nThere is a place to eat sushi and a store that sells swimming things. There is also a place to get a manicure and a swimming pool. You can get food, a manicure, and fill your pool all at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt. Young people like to eat there while they skateboard and use a special device to breathe in the air.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet area where not much changes.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is my home,\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the big open space. She came from a town where a grocery store was near her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. I could see it in her eyes. She finally understood where I was from.\n\nWe drove down a small country road. There was a big water-filled hole on one side. Just after that was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They each have a big piece of land. Everyone takes care of their land.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers are planted and trees with different colors change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine after being washed.\n\nAs we drove, I pointed to my house. My neighbor was outside. He is a kind Korean man. He spends the day mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him, but he is also a very interesting person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and not as funny. He still has a special face.\n\nWe arrived at my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind the house, there is a stream that feeds into the water hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes animals from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge, there is a special place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That is where I grew up. I built forts in the trees and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nIn the winter, it is very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees that were green are now bare. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I used to make snowmen and snow angels. We had a lot of fun. We even made forts to fight with snowballs.\n\nThis was a special place for us to play. We didn't worry about anything. We were just two happy kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a strange city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place where people are free to be different. Some people like this because it reminds them of Portland in the 1990s and early 2000s. That Portland was a smaller city with lower costs. It had many creative and unique cultures. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a call to come to the city. Here, people will still think you are strange, but it is a compliment.\n\nMany people from California are moving to Portland. This is changing the city. New homes are being built for them. But Portland is still strange. Strange does not mean the city does not have modern things. We buy many things from China like the rest of the country. We have normal things too. We have yoga, hipster shops, and business people.\n\nPerhaps being weird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens with flowers and food. In the summer, we have free boxes. These are boxes with things that people are giving away. You can find good things in these boxes. They can have clothes, books, or anything.\n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland can be magical. This is what Portland is about to me. But I am only one of many people who like Portland. Some people I live with would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to yoga with goats or watch the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is full of people who like different things. Some people are trying to achieve their dreams. Others are drinking too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. This problem often comes from mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies also contribute to the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. The city's services are not enough to help everyone. People who are not homeless are divided. Some people care about the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not unique to Portland.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They do not mind what people do. They are strong and steady. When I am stressed and sad, the mountains help me. They make me feel better. They give me the strength to go on.\n\nI moved to this town when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing I saw and liked. The university has nice buildings and a pond and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied for a long time. I can walk or take the bus to the city center. It is old and has a lot of history. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is busy, but it is not too busy.\n\nI can escape the city by going to the library. It is a small town with a quiet atmosphere. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It makes me feel calm, but it also makes me think about my life. I have good memories and bad memories here. I like walking in the park with my friends. I like going to the movies in the city. I also have sad times here. I like to walk by the pond and think about my life. I see turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want to do.\n\nI walk by the pond and the park and the houses. I reach the main street. The sun shines brightly. I see the mountains in the north. They are strong and high. They make me feel like I can do anything. They make me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is very good. Bensonhurst is a part of New York City, so you will still feel like you are in the city. When you visit, you will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. Because of this, you see an Asian-owned store on almost every street. These stores are often supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to shop. I live near four Asian supermarkets. They are all close to each other, within two minutes of walking. This is very convenient for buying groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a diverse neighborhood with many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses in the neighborhood are owned by Asian people. There is also a park near where I live. It has many things for people to do, like basketball courts, a soccer field, and swings for kids. People of all kinds play together in the park.\n\nThere are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most of the buildings are for people who live in apartments or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this neighborhood are generally nice. However, it can be noisy. Cars often drive by with loud music. People also drive quickly and loudly. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I had a bad experience in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But many people do not do this in Bensonhurst. You often see dog waste on the street. My big complaint is the dog waste. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "In the place where I live, there are not many sidewalks. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many runners go there to exercise every day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is rough and not very safe to drive on in some places.\n\nMany telephone and electric wires are above the street. They look old and damaged because strong winds often knock them down. People fix them often, but they still look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. However, people don't like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nThe weather is often cloudy. Most days are overcast and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. I had to spend three hours cleaning it. There are not many children in my area. Most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. Dogs are common in the neighborhood. You often see them in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it outside.\n\nWild rabbits live in the area. They are big and like to dig in gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We have a few stores near the water, but if you walk downhill, you can find more restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but casting stones into the water is fun. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is in a quiet neighborhood. It is between two big roads, so we see some traffic. Most people do their work in their yards and daily tasks. I know most of my neighbors. They like to walk and exercise their dogs. Children ride their bicycles. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife and I, and our two daughters, ten and fourteen years old. This means we see our neighbors often.\n\nWe like to play outside. We even play in the rain. We sometimes grill food on our back porch. It smells good. Many people cut their grass. We hear a lot of lawn mowers from March to October.\n\nOur neighborhood is surrounded by trees. This means it is cool and shady. But in the fall, we have a lot of leaves. We must clean them up. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe do not have much winter. It seems like fall is very long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work in the garage on my truck and other projects. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to my neighbors.\n\nOn holidays, it is quiet. Some families visit from other places on Thanksgiving and other special days. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. The only thing I do not like is that our street is a through street.",
            "My home is in a dry desert area. It is very hot. The ground is brown. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it means the owner works very hard to keep it green. I have lived here since the 1990s. The houses were far apart. Now, more people have moved in. The area looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. The people here are friendly. But, like in any city, some people are nice and some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are friendly. The stores here are like big chain stores. They sell food and other things. There are no special stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy food from a special store, you must travel far. The main jobs here are in construction. Many people build houses and buildings. This is because the area is not fully developed. It has many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install walls and bars. One good thing about my home is the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many types of animals and plants. It is hard to protect the desert, but we must. We must learn about the animals that live here. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some good places to visit. Victorville is a good place for families. You can see the desert and do fun things. If you come, visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum is interesting. It has rocks and old bones from the desert. It also has things from Native American people and old objects that tell us about the history of Victorville. If you like the desert and its history, visit the museum.",

I also think of the campus and buildings around my dorm as my neighborhood. \n\nMy neighborhood has many things like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses. \n\nFirst, there are apartments. Two to four people live in each room. Each floor has four to six rooms. So, 20 people live in each building. \n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. They have two to four bedrooms. Alumni usually live in these houses. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. Two people usually share a room. This is the most common kind of housing in my neighborhood. \n\nLet's talk about the people. My school likes diversity. The neighborhood has people from many countries and ages. Staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Old students live in apartments. \n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores sell food, school clothes, and groceries. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. At first, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. I missed my old home. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. We have a new, safer home now. We also have a better high school. I made some new friends and some new enemies in school. I knew a few neighbors very well. Mr. Glen and his family are nice. They live next door to us. I like them. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a piece of his wife's shoe when she took it off! I also danced a lot. A girl from Mr. Glen's family, Marsharii, is a friend. I don't see her now.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I like to walk in the park. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I have a wooden sword and like to play with it. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time.\n\nI have many happy memories here. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. They are students or low-income people. They live here because the rent is not high. There is an elementary school close to my home. Many children live here. I don't know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My apartment building put a special air cleaner near their door. It makes the air smell good. I think it's funny.\n\nThe buildings near me are old. But they may have new inside. There are new apartments down the street. But I don't like them. They are not well built. The rent is high. I think it's not fair. Many people live in these buildings because they are near the campus. Across the street from my home is a cheap restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near the restaurant. I heard it's a bad place to work. The city gave money to fix the road near my home. Now the sidewalk is wide and there is grass on the side of the road. The area is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down. But I like the trees near my home.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad. The buildings look old and dirty. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. Most crimes happen at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I don't blame them alone. There are other apartments on my street that have problems. There are many trees on my street. I like living here. It's affordable. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses. They look like separate houses because they are far apart. Each house is yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. People here are friendly. They like to talk to each other. On some evenings, we stand in our driveways and visit. Our children play outside with toys and chalk. We enjoy this. It is a good feeling in a world with many machines. It feels like the past.\n\nOur neighborhood has fields, trees, and blue skies. We see white clouds. This is nice. But sometimes we have bad weather. We had a big storm. We heard a warning and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The storm was loud. We heard hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. We saw a rainbow. I took pictures.\n\nThe streets were quiet after the storm. People finally came home. We had dinner together. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. Our apartments are the same on the outside, but different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer. In the morning, I hear a frog singing. It is a good place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters singing. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard at first. I became friends with two people who lived nearby. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. The same people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American neighborhoods. There are many houses with two floors. I often hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. If you need help, people will help you. I have ordered packages online many times without any problems. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad because it reminds me of good times. My neighborhood is very different from others because it has many types of food. We have Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near us. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and many pizza shops. You can find everything you need at the stores. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store on the same street. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am thankful for my good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town signs say. \n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. They are not near the road. They are in the fields. \n\nIn the town, there is one traffic light. This is where people buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for Cherry Coca-Cola. \n\nThere is one small grocery store called IGA. People go there to buy a few things. Most people go to a bigger store in a nearby town to buy their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. It is always busy. There is a small furniture store. The woman who runs it is kind. She has two men to help deliver the furniture. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets. They cut their hair and take care of them. \n\nThere is a small school for little kids. When they grow up, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. It will have a place for kids to play and people to walk their dogs. The town is small. People can walk by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast about people who disappeared. This surprised me. Many apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I never heard of this story and neither did my friends. We are struggling. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we learned to save money. We like old toys and old clothes. We smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke or get used to things. The flea market is always there. It smells like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean the piano.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The area is crowded, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore people and cars come here every year. It's a growing city. A big company that sells things online is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet. You can keep your private life. The city is lively. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a good community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind and I like them. We help each other.\n\nI live in a big apartment building, but my neighbors make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is very clean and nice. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep it that way. The houses are all the same. They are single family homes with small yards. The yards have grass and small stones. There is a short driveway. Everyone has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. You will not see holes in the road.\n\nMost houses are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have a special box for mail in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. My neighborhood is like a mix of a small town and the country. We have a lot of space. We have several swimming pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. We also have paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things that people usually need, like a big store with many things inside. It takes 15 minutes to drive to anywhere important. When you get there, you can find many stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and paths. We are not close to big shopping, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area has low property values. Many people live here because they cannot afford to live in other parts of town. They rent or own small houses. My neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. However, it is still not bad. There have been a few violent crimes near my home. These include some shootings and one murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Fortunately, we have not had any big problems with crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we leave them outside. A big problem in our town is the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. We have places to help people with addiction. These include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends. Despite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son is happy there. The school takes care of children with special needs. He has no problems at school. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. We do not have to worry about our son going hungry. The city is making our town better. They have fixed roads and parks. However, they have done more work on the other side of town. Our side needs more help. This is a problem for us. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores for our needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a big apartment building. It is across from an old theater. There is a fun bar a short walk away. People like to go there on warm summer nights. \n\nWhen it is cold, people who do not have homes sleep near the city park. The park is big. It has concrete and stairs around it. People can walk to the park from my building. They can also walk to a place where they can bathe and get warm.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the people. It used to be a bad place. Many years ago, there was a lot of violence. The government tried to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. I think this is like the past. It makes me think about racism and unfair ideas. I like my neighborhood because the people are kind. They help each other. I have walked the streets at night and met many people. They have helped me when I needed it. I feel happy in my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a place where you can see a lot of farmland and small cities. There are no big stores like Walmart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. I live near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. The water is very beautiful. My town is also surrounded by water. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to play in.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not very close to each other. They are older homes, some new and some old. Many houses have basements that you can see from the road. Some houses have aluminum siding and some have different colors. Most houses have yards with toys and gardens. People take care of their lawns and keep them clean.\n\nPeople in this town work hard to make a living. They are good people who raise their families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. Neighbors know each other and are friendly. If you see someone grilling or walking their dog, you can wave and say hello. The lawns are neat and clean. You can tell it is a safe place to live.\n\nThere is a police station and a jail near my house. We also have a place to recycle and a baseball field where you can hear the announcers. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying overhead. Our ice cream shop is close by too. You can walk to the park and ride your bike to the ice cream store. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. There are houses and offices near each other. Some buildings are office buildings, some are stores, and some are restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small shops. These small shops are popular. They are in shopping malls and on streets. The streets are near neighborhoods that are quiet and nice. There are parks near my neighborhood. Many people go to these parks with their small children. My neighborhood is very diverse. We have many different kinds of people. In one place, we have a big LGBTQ+ community. We also have an Orthodox Jewish community and people from the Soviet Union. There are many other communities in the city. We have areas called Korea town and China town. We also have Little Armenia. These areas are not far from my neighborhood. But the drive can be long because of traffic. It can take a long time to drive a short distance. Many people in my city do not walk. They prefer to drive or take a car. The city is very big, and traffic is bad. It is hard to find parking spaces. Recently, the city has been building many new apartment buildings. This makes some people happy, but others are not. They do not want more people and more cars. There are many kinds of houses in my city. People live in big apartment buildings, small houses, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of houses. People of all ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. The neighborhood is not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts, connected together. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the side. It looks like the suburbs of America a long time ago. That time was the American dream. Many people wanted to live like this. But now the dream is not as strong. My neighborhood reminds people that the dream is still alive. People visit my neighborhood and see that the dream is still real. The people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside like the world is their own. The local school has been here for almost 90 years. It still shows children their future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing when cars come. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But children stopped going because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. The younger people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one highway that passes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next door. We used to want to have our own entrance and exit. The younger people wanted it, but the older people said no. They said it would ruin our town. Now they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People do not usually think of it as a place to live. But if you go behind an old building and walk down the road, you will see a busy community. There are many apartments here. They are next to each other, like boxes in a line.\n\nSome of the apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about those. The other apartments are a different story. Almost no one knows about them. Across from the apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They wake up early in the morning and go to class with coffee in their hands. The gates open slowly to let them in. Cars drive by quickly, and people shake their fists at the students for slowing them down.\n\nThe road splits into two. There is a park on one side and a building where people go to get better after breaking a bone. The building has nice furniture on the porch. There is a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people skateboarding. The young people laugh and talk about their friends.\n\nThere is a place to eat sushi and a store that sells swimming things. There is also a place to get a manicure and a swimming pool. You can get food, a manicure, and fill your pool all at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt. Young people like to eat there while they skateboard and use a special device to breathe in the air.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet area where not much changes.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is my home,\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the big open space. She came from a town where a grocery store was near her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. I could see it in her eyes. She finally understood where I was from.\n\nWe drove down a small country road. There was a big water-filled hole on one side. Just after that was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They each have a big piece of land. Everyone takes care of their land.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers are planted and trees with different colors change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine after being washed.\n\nAs we drove, I pointed to my house. My neighbor was outside. He is a kind Korean man. He spends the day mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him, but he is also a very interesting person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and not as funny. He still has a special face.\n\nWe arrived at my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind the house, there is a stream that feeds into the water hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes animals from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge, there is a special place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That is where I grew up. I built forts in the trees and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nIn the winter, it is very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees that were green are now bare. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I used to make snowmen and snow angels. We had a lot of fun. We even made forts to fight with snowballs.\n\nThis was a special place for us to play. We didn't worry about anything. We were just two happy kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a strange city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place where people are free to be different. Some people like this because it reminds them of Portland in the 1990s and early 2000s. That Portland was a smaller city with lower costs. It had many creative and unique cultures. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a call to come to the city. Here, people will still think you are strange, but it is a compliment.\n\nMany people from California are moving to Portland. This is changing the city. New homes are being built for them. But Portland is still strange. Strange does not mean the city does not have modern things. We buy many things from China like the rest of the country. We have normal things too. We have yoga, hipster shops, and business people.\n\nPerhaps being weird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens with flowers and food. In the summer, we have free boxes. These are boxes with things that people are giving away. You can find good things in these boxes. They can have clothes, books, or anything.\n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland can be magical. This is what Portland is about to me. But I am only one of many people who like Portland. Some people I live with would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to yoga with goats or watch the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is full of people who like different things. Some people are trying to achieve their dreams. Others are drinking too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. This problem often comes from mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies also contribute to the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. The city's services are not enough to help everyone. People who are not homeless are divided. Some people care about the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not unique to Portland.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They do not mind what people do. They are strong and steady. When I am stressed and sad, the mountains help me. They make me feel better. They give me the strength to go on.\n\nI moved to this town when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing I saw and liked. The university has nice buildings and a pond and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied for a long time. I can walk or take the bus to the city center. It is old and has a lot of history. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is busy, but it is not too busy.\n\nI can escape the city by going to the library. It is a small town with a quiet atmosphere. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It makes me feel calm, but it also makes me think about my life. I have good memories and bad memories here. I like walking in the park with my friends. I like going to the movies in the city. I also have sad times here. I like to walk by the pond and think about my life. I see turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want to do.\n\nI walk by the pond and the park and the houses. I reach the main street. The sun shines brightly. I see the mountains in the north. They are strong and high. They make me feel like I can do anything. They make me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is very good. Bensonhurst is a part of New York City, so you will still feel like you are in the city. When you visit, you will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. Because of this, you see an Asian-owned store on almost every street. These stores are often supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to shop. I live near four Asian supermarkets. They are all close to each other, within two minutes of walking. This is very convenient for buying groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a diverse neighborhood with many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses in the neighborhood are owned by Asian people. There is also a park near where I live. It has many things for people to do, like basketball courts, a soccer field, and swings for kids. People of all kinds play together in the park.\n\nThere are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most of the buildings are for people who live in apartments or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this neighborhood are generally nice. However, it can be noisy. Cars often drive by with loud music. People also drive quickly and loudly. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I had a bad experience in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But many people do not do this in Bensonhurst. You often see dog waste on the street. My big complaint is the dog waste. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "In the place where I live, there are not many sidewalks. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many runners go there to exercise every day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is rough and not very safe to drive on in some places.\n\nMany telephone and electric wires are above the street. They look old and damaged because strong winds often knock them down. People fix them often, but they still look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. However, people don't like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nThe weather is often cloudy. Most days are overcast and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. I had to spend three hours cleaning it. There are not many children in my area. Most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. Dogs are common in the neighborhood. You often see them in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it outside.\n\nWild rabbits live in the area. They are big and like to dig in gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We have a few stores near the water, but if you walk downhill, you can find more restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but casting stones into the water is fun. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is in a quiet neighborhood. It is between two big roads, so we see some traffic. Most people do their work in their yards and daily tasks. I know most of my neighbors. They like to walk and exercise their dogs. Children ride their bicycles. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife and I, and our two daughters, ten and fourteen years old. This means we see our neighbors often.\n\nWe like to play outside. We even play in the rain. We sometimes grill food on our back porch. It smells good. Many people cut their grass. We hear a lot of lawn mowers from March to October.\n\nOur neighborhood is surrounded by trees. This means it is cool and shady. But in the fall, we have a lot of leaves. We must clean them up. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe do not have much winter. It seems like fall is very long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work in the garage on my truck and other projects. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to my neighbors.\n\nOn holidays, it is quiet. Some families visit from other places on Thanksgiving and other special days. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. The only thing I do not like is that our street is a through street.",
            "My home is in a dry desert area. It is very hot. The ground is brown. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it means the owner works very hard to keep it green. I have lived here since the 1990s. The houses were far apart. Now, more people have moved in. The area looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. The people here are friendly. But, like in any city, some people are nice and some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are friendly. The stores here are like big chain stores. They sell food and other things. There are no special stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy food from a special store, you must travel far. The main jobs here are in construction. Many people build houses and buildings. This is because the area is not fully developed. It has many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install walls and bars. One good thing about my home is the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many types of animals and plants. It is hard to protect the desert, but we must. We must learn about the animals that live here. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some good places to visit. Victorville is a good place for families. You can see the desert and do fun things. If you come, visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum is interesting. It has rocks and old bones from the desert. It also has things from Native American people and old objects that tell us about the history of Victorville. If you like the desert and its history, visit the museum.",

I also think of the campus and buildings around my dorm as my neighborhood. \n\nMy neighborhood has many things like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses. \n\nFirst, there are apartments. Two to four people live in each room. Each floor has four to six rooms. So, 20 people live in each building. \n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. They have two to four bedrooms. Alumni usually live in these houses. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. Two people usually share a room. This is the most common kind of housing in my neighborhood. \n\nLet's talk about the people. My school likes diversity. The neighborhood has people from many countries and ages. Staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Old students live in apartments. \n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores sell food, school clothes, and groceries. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. At first, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. I missed my old home. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. We have a new, safer home now. We also have a better high school. I made some new friends and some new enemies in school. I knew a few neighbors very well. Mr. Glen and his family are nice. They live next door to us. I like them. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a piece of his wife's shoe when she took it off! I also danced a lot. A girl from Mr. Glen's family, Marsharii, is a friend. I don't see her now.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I like to walk in the park. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I have a wooden sword and like to play with it. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time.\n\nI have many happy memories here. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. They are students or low-income people. They live here because the rent is not high. There is an elementary school close to my home. Many children live here. I don't know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My apartment building put a special air cleaner near their door. It makes the air smell good. I think it's funny.\n\nThe buildings near me are old. But they may have new inside. There are new apartments down the street. But I don't like them. They are not well built. The rent is high. I think it's not fair. Many people live in these buildings because they are near the campus. Across the street from my home is a cheap restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near the restaurant. I heard it's a bad place to work. The city gave money to fix the road near my home. Now the sidewalk is wide and there is grass on the side of the road. The area is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down. But I like the trees near my home.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad. The buildings look old and dirty. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. Most crimes happen at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I don't blame them alone. There are other apartments on my street that have problems. There are many trees on my street. I like living here. It's affordable. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses. They look like separate houses because they are far apart. Each house is yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. People here are friendly. They like to talk to each other. On some evenings, we stand in our driveways and visit. Our children play outside with toys and chalk. We enjoy this. It is a good feeling in a world with many machines. It feels like the past.\n\nOur neighborhood has fields, trees, and blue skies. We see white clouds. This is nice. But sometimes we have bad weather. We had a big storm. We heard a warning and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The storm was loud. We heard hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. We saw a rainbow. I took pictures.\n\nThe streets were quiet after the storm. People finally came home. We had dinner together. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. Our apartments are the same on the outside, but different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer. In the morning, I hear a frog singing. It is a good place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters singing. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard at first. I became friends with two people who lived nearby. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. The same people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American neighborhoods. There are many houses with two floors. I often hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. If you need help, people will help you. I have ordered packages online many times without any problems. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad because it reminds me of good times. My neighborhood is very different from others because it has many types of food. We have Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near us. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and many pizza shops. You can find everything you need at the stores. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store on the same street. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am thankful for my good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town signs say. \n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. They are not near the road. They are in the fields. \n\nIn the town, there is one traffic light. This is where people buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for Cherry Coca-Cola. \n\nThere is one small grocery store called IGA. People go there to buy a few things. Most people go to a bigger store in a nearby town to buy their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. It is always busy. There is a small furniture store. The woman who runs it is kind. She has two men to help deliver the furniture. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets. They cut their hair and take care of them. \n\nThere is a small school for little kids. When they grow up, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. It will have a place for kids to play and people to walk their dogs. The town is small. People can walk by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast about people who disappeared. This surprised me. Many apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I never heard of this story and neither did my friends. We are struggling. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we learned to save money. We like old toys and old clothes. We smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke or get used to things. The flea market is always there. It smells like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean the piano.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The area is crowded, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore people and cars come here every year. It's a growing city. A big company that sells things online is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet. You can keep your private life. The city is lively. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a good community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind and I like them. We help each other.\n\nI live in a big apartment building, but my neighbors make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is very clean and nice. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep it that way. The houses are all the same. They are single family homes with small yards. The yards have grass and small stones. There is a short driveway. Everyone has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. You will not see holes in the road.\n\nMost houses are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have a special box for mail in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. My neighborhood is like a mix of a small town and the country. We have a lot of space. We have several swimming pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. We also have paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things that people usually need, like a big store with many things inside. It takes 15 minutes to drive to anywhere important. When you get there, you can find many stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and paths. We are not close to big shopping, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area has low property values. Many people live here because they cannot afford to live in other parts of town. They rent or own small houses. My neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. However, it is still not bad. There have been a few violent crimes near my home. These include some shootings and one murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Fortunately, we have not had any big problems with crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we leave them outside. A big problem in our town is the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. We have places to help people with addiction. These include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends. Despite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son is happy there. The school takes care of children with special needs. He has no problems at school. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. We do not have to worry about our son going hungry. The city is making our town better. They have fixed roads and parks. However, they have done more work on the other side of town. Our side needs more help. This is a problem for us. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores for our needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a big apartment building. It is across from an old theater. There is a fun bar a short walk away. People like to go there on warm summer nights. \n\nWhen it is cold, people who do not have homes sleep near the city park. The park is big. It has concrete and stairs around it. People can walk to the park from my building. They can also walk to a place where they can bathe and get warm.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the people. It used to be a bad place. Many years ago, there was a lot of violence. The government tried to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. I think this is like the past. It makes me think about racism and unfair ideas. I like my neighborhood because the people are kind. They help each other. I have walked the streets at night and met many people. They have helped me when I needed it. I feel happy in my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a place where you can see a lot of farmland and small cities. There are no big stores like Walmart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. I live near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. The water is very beautiful. My town is also surrounded by water. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to play in.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not very close to each other. They are older homes, some new and some old. Many houses have basements that you can see from the road. Some houses have aluminum siding and some have different colors. Most houses have yards with toys and gardens. People take care of their lawns and keep them clean.\n\nPeople in this town work hard to make a living. They are good people who raise their families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. Neighbors know each other and are friendly. If you see someone grilling or walking their dog, you can wave and say hello. The lawns are neat and clean. You can tell it is a safe place to live.\n\nThere is a police station and a jail near my house. We also have a place to recycle and a baseball field where you can hear the announcers. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying overhead. Our ice cream shop is close by too. You can walk to the park and ride your bike to the ice cream store. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood is very different. Different kinds of buildings are near each other - homes and businesses. Some businesses are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new restaurants to eat at and stores to buy things in. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and new. They are in malls and on streets. These streets are close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. People take their young children to these parks. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. We have a community for people who like same-sex relationships. We also have a community for Orthodox Jews and people who came from the Soviet Union. There are many people from different countries and cultures in our city. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are a few miles from my home. But driving a few miles can take a long time because of traffic. Many people in my city do not walk. They like to drive. Our city is very busy and has bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. Many new buildings are being built in our city. This is because many people are moving here. Some people are unhappy about this. They do not want more people and cars. There are many kinds of homes in our city. Some people live in big apartment buildings. Others live in houses or smaller apartment buildings. Some homes are for one family. Others are for two families. My neighborhood is also different. People of many ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a close community like we used to be. When I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We were all friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has many houses. Most are for one family. Some houses are split into two, but still connected. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway on one side. It looks like many houses in America from a long time ago. That was the American dream. Many people wanted to live in a place like this. But now, the dream is not the same. Many people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice. But families still live here. Children play. There is a school here. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes children think about their future. It makes older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not full. People like to play basketball. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by an Arab family. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football. They stop when cars come by. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know their neighbors. There was a school for karate. But when people stopped watching karate movies, children stopped wanting to study karate. Now it is a store that sells medicine. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies. People like to go there because it is cheap. The youth do not like it, but older people do. There is a highway near my town. We do not have an exit for the highway. People wanted to make an exit, but the older people did not want it. They said it would hurt the town. So, the city said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is behind a shopping center, not a place people usually think of living. But if you look closely, you will see a community. Behind the old shopping center and some hotels, you will find people living in small buildings called apartments. These buildings are next to each other like dolls in a row. Some of these buildings have problems, so we will not talk about them. The other buildings are different. Across the street is a college for students. It is quiet and sleepy. Students walk in at 7 in the morning with coffee. The gates creak open and close slowly. Commuters honk their horns and get upset when they have to wait. The road divides into two streets. One side has a park. There is a place to fix broken bones next to the park. The building has a nice porch and a fan that blows air. Children play in the park. They run and play on the grass. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. They talk to each other about boys and TV shows. There is a restaurant with cheap food. There is a store to buy things for swimming. There is a place to get your nails done. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Young people eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards. This neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is a part of history that does not change much.",
            "We were driving through many fields of corn. My friend asked, \"Where is everything?\" I said, \"This is it!\" I knew she would be surprised by the open space. She was from a city where a store was near her house. She had never seen so much open land.\n\nI told her about growing up in a small town in Ohio. I shared with her what life was like. She was surprised to learn about my home. We were on a country road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water. The next place was my home. The houses were made of brick and a hard, rough material called stucco. Each house had a big piece of land that people liked to take care of.\n\nIn the spring, flowers were everywhere. The trees changed colors with the seasons. People had nice cars. They were shiny and clean after a good wash. As we continued down the road, I saw a friendly neighbor. He was always outside cutting his grass and singing. Everyone liked to laugh at him, but he was a kind person. He was a doctor a long time ago. Now he is older and not as funny. \n\nMy house was next. There were geese in the side yard. They ran from a dog. In the back, there was a small stream. You could hear frogs and cows from the farms nearby. Across a bridge made of wood was a special place. The trees, herbs, and flowers grew there naturally. I spent much of my childhood in this place. I built forts and played with friends. In the winter, the yard was empty and the trees were bare. But it was beautiful. The snow made a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and angels. We had a lot of fun.\n\nWe would fight as kids, but in the winter, we made snowballs and built shelters. We were happy and did not worry about anything. We were just kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is different from other places. Some people think this slogan reminds us of the past. The past Portland was less known and less expensive. It had many creative and unique groups of people. Now, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes. But Portland is still weird.\n\nWeird means accepting of things that are not normal. But it does not mean Portland does not have modern things. We buy things from other countries, like China. Portland has many ways of being weird. Some people like yoga and some like business. We all like to have fun. My neighborhood is colorful. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables in every yard. In the summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are things people are giving away. They can be clothes, books, or other things. You never know what you might find.\n\nWalking through the neighborhood is fun. Portland is full of people who like different things. Some people go to yoga with goats, and some go to soccer games. Portland has people who chase their dreams. Some people like to spend time at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland has problems. We have a problem with drugs. This is often caused by mental health problems. The cloud and rain in Portland do not help. We also have a homelessness problem. Our services are good, but not enough. The community is divided. Some people care for the homeless, but some people are angry.",
            "The mountains are always there. They see the sun every morning and evening. I forget about them many times. But they are always there. They do not change. They do not get angry or sad.

I can rest my worried mind and keep moving forward.\n\nI moved here when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing that caught my attention. The university has many nice buildings and trees. But the mountains are special. They are the most beautiful things here.\n\nThe town is also very nice. There are many cafes where I studied for many hours. The town has a mix of old and new things. The old buildings are very beautiful. I can walk or take the bus to the main street. The street is busy and fun. But I can also escape to a quiet place near the library.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is busy and quiet at the same time. This makes it very interesting. I have many happy memories here. I remember walking with my friends in the park. I also remember running to the movie theater.\n\nBut the town also has sad memories. Everyone has sad times in life. I cried by the pond many times. I thought about my life and my future. I saw the turtles and ducks living their lives. I wondered about my own life. But then I looked up and saw the mountains. They are strong and steady. They reminded me to keep going.\n\nI walked to the main street. The sun was shining. The mountains were in front of me. They were beautiful. They told me to keep moving forward. They reminded me to be strong.",
            "Bensonhurst is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. You can easily find it. The public transportation system is very good. Many people use it. Bensonhurst is a busy area. You will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asians live here. Over the past 20 years, many Asians moved to Bensonhurst. Now, you see an Asian store on every block. These stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores. They have good food at low prices. It is also very easy to buy things. I live near here. There are four Asian stores within two minutes of each other. This is very convenient.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asians. Many immigrants and their families live here. Some businesses are owned by Asians, but there are others too. There is a park near here. It has basketball courts, a big field for sports, and a playground for children. People of all kinds visit the park and play together. Bensonhurst has many small homes and co-op buildings. Most people live in two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but can be noisy. They often drive quickly and play loud music. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is generally safe, but some people may cause trouble. I personally had a problem here in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But here, many people do not follow the rules. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. Everything slopes downhill and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many runners like to exercise there. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road is bumpy in some places and can be hard to drive on.\n\nSome of the wires on the street are old and broken. It rains a lot here and branches break the wires. The workers fix them, but the repairs look messy. There are many tall trees around my home. But many people don't like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay.\n\nIt is beautiful when the sun sets. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy, so we see the sun through a mist. Most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: cars, houses, and fences. I once left my car outside for a month and it was covered in moss. It took three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The school is close, but most people are older and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often in people's yards or running down the street. If you leave a door open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits run around the area. They are big and the gardeners don't like them because they dig up the plants. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We also see small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my home, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not big, but the rocks by the water are fun to throw into the ocean. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other shoreline even when it is misty.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is between two main roads, so there is more traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. We know most of our neighbors. They work in their yards and homes every day. In the winter, we sled on a nearby hill.\n\nI live in a house at the corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We know their cars. When we see a strange car, we notice it. Some people walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We are usually at home because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife, two daughters, and me.\n\nWe go outside and play. We even play in the rain. Sometimes we cook outside on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool and there are leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood.\n\nOn holidays, our neighborhood is quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see our neighbors with their families. Cars park on the street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",

When you see a green lawn, you know the person is working hard to take care of it. \n\nI lived here in the 1990s. Houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. But it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing in the same way. \n\nThe people in my neighborhood are friendly. But some areas are not so good. I have old friends around me, and I like this neighborhood. We have big stores, like Food for Less and Smart. But we do not have many small, special stores. \n\nIf you want to buy something special, you have to drive far. We do not have stores like Whole Foods. \n\nMost people work in construction. The city is not fully developed, so there is a lot of space to build. This worries me. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. \n\nI work in the construction field. I install drywall and T-bars. \n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many types of animals. We should respect the animals and the environment. \n\nI have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them. \n\nWe have some fun things to do in our town. Victorville is a good place for families. We have a big event called the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You should visit us and see the snow in Wrightwood and take a winter sports lesson. If you like learning about the desert, go to the Victor Valley Museum. It has many cool things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is different from others. I do not live in a normal neighborhood. I live on a college campus. My home is a dormitory. My community is the people who live with me in the dormitory and the people on the campus.\n\nMy neighborhood has homes, people, stores and a park. But it is not like other neighborhoods. My neighborhood has apartments, houses and dormitory buildings. \n\nThere are three kinds of homes. One kind is an apartment. In an apartment, 2-4 people live in a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors. It can have 20 people.\n\nAnother kind is a house. These houses are for people who go to the school. They are 2-4 rooms. Some alumni live in these houses.\n\nThe third kind is a dormitory. Many students live in a dormitory. Each room has 2 people. Some rooms have only one person.\n\nPeople from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. The staff lives in houses. New students live in dormitories. Older students live in apartments.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. You can buy food, clothes and other things. My neighborhood also has a park. It is a safe place for everyone. The park is clean and has no crime.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here from Riverdale. I missed my old home and my friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. They wanted us to live in a better place. It had a good school and nice houses.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and some new enemies at school. I got to know my neighbors a little. Mr. Glen and his kids are nice people. They are like a family to me. I like them very much. They got married, and I went to their wedding. It was fun.\n\nMr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw away her leg bandage. I caught it! I also like to hang out with their daughter Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze. I have a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I have been with my friends Kason and Curtis. We like to play video games and have fun together.\n\nI also like to go to the park. It is peaceful and calm. I bring sticks and practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword and practice fighting. I have fun doing what I love. The neighborhood has a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but it was fun.\n\nI have had many happy times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. But these are the ones that I remember best. I think the best is yet to come.",
            "My home is near the college where I go to school. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are here too. They are not very expensive. One bar is new. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people here are students or they have low incomes. They live here because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children here too. There is a school near my home.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put a special machine near their door to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but the inside is new. Down the street, there are new apartments. But they are not good quality. They are cheap, but the rent is expensive. I do not like this.\n\nNear my home, there is a restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. It is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my home. Now it is nicer.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. Some of the trees were cut down. But there are still many trees here. Behind my building, there are trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken and the buildings are old. There are many trees on this street. This is to hide how bad the buildings look.\n\nThere is crime in my area. It happens at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I do not blame just them. There is crime at another apartment complex across from me too. But I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is near and there are two buses to take me to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has many houses on a street that ends in a circle. The houses look like separate homes. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people are friendly, but not all. We stand on our driveways at night and talk to each other. We see children playing with toys, drawing with chalk, or flying kites. This is nice in a world with many machines. It feels like the past. We live near fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. However, we have a problem. This season, we have had tornado warnings. One night, there was a tornado. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for loud hail. The hail fell to the ground. When the storm ended, the road was hot. It was 92 degrees outside, but quickly became 75 degrees. The hail melted on the hot ground. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I ran inside and took pictures. My friends and family were amazed, just like me. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then, people came home from where they were when the storm started. It was business as usual. People were cooking dinner, and children were playing. I love living here. I moved here from a place in New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. My apartment is nice, but not all apartments are the same. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I also like to visit the pond. I have seen deer and heard a big bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It feels like I am living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was going into eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. But I became friends with someone who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not my friends anymore, but I still remember them. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other neighborhoods in America. There are many houses with two floors. I hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. You can leave your packages outside and they will be safe. I trust my neighbors. There is a park very close to my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball and football with the other kids in the neighborhood. But I also hurt my nose playing football. Now I go to the park with my cousin's young children. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food online and have it delivered to their homes. There are also many fast food places and pizza shops. There are stores with everything you need. You can find dry cleaners and a place to buy medicine. There is a grocery store and other shops. One store is owned by an Indian family. I like my neighborhood. Reading about problems with neighbors on social media makes me happy to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. This town is famous for peaches. It is called Johnston. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the town's entrance.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. Most of the land is used for peach trees or cattle. Houses are not very close to each other. They are mostly two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep people cool in the summer. Others have gray shingles.\n\nPeople who live outside the town center have their houses far from the road. They use the front fields for animals and crops. In the town center, there is a traffic light that helps cars move safely. This is where you can find the town's stores.\n\nThere are three places to eat quickly. One is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. The town has a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola.\n\nThere is a small grocery store called IGA. This store sells food and other things. But many people go to a big store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things and is very busy.\n\nThe town has a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman. She has been there for a long time. She also has people who will help move the furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThere are two small doctor's offices and a veterinary clinic outside the town center. They help the people who live in Johnston. The town has a small school called Johnston Elementary School. When the students are older, they go to school in the next town. The town is small and does not have many parks. But they are making a new park now. This will give families a place to go and visit.\n\nThe town is not very big. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to walk pets. But it is a nice town. You can drive by it quickly without noticing it is there.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. The news surprised me. It said that many apartments cost over one thousand dollars a month. I did not know anything about this story. My friends did not either. Life is hard here. Some of my friends cry at night because they are very poor. But we have learned to save money. We like old things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might smoke or get used to our situation. The city has a lot of old things. We have flea markets and thrift stores. There are three thrift stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two stores that sell used things, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are very crowded, but the thrift stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city gets more crowded. Many cars and people go there. It is a growing city. They say it is like New York. Everyone is busy and does not ask for help. You can be alone if you want. People will leave you alone. This is different from the South. In the South, if you care about someone, you want to know what is wrong. Here, people do not ask questions. You can be yourself for a long time. The city is lively. There is always music coming from the house next door or the people upstairs who sing. We are like a community. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone is sad. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are nice. We help each other. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too. I live in a big apartment complex, but my neighbors make me feel happy.",
            "I live in a common kind of neighborhood. It has many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association takes care of the area. The houses are well-maintained. They all have a small garden in front. There are also some decorative stones and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are in good shape. You will not see any big holes on the road.\n\nMost houses have one floor. Some have two floors. We do not have a mailbox in front of each house. We have a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to get their mail. There are also two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. It is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many community pools. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails. You can walk your dog or go for a walk alone. The neighborhood is big. You can run around and get some exercise. Most people who live here are old. The area is safe. Everyone helps each other.\n\nSome people are middle-aged or young professionals. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things you need. For example, we have a big store called a mall. It is not very big, but it has everything you need. I can drive to any store in about 15 minutes. There are many stores with good food, cheap stores, and more.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things like pools and walking trails. We are not close to many stores, but we can drive to them easily.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city, but not in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Houses here are not very valuable. People who live here usually rent or own these houses. They are low-income people. \n\nMy neighborhood is not ugly. People here are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of the town. But they are still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. These crimes include shootings and one person was killed. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by crime, except for sometimes items disappearing from our porch.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. It is called the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people in the US have this problem. It is a big issue in our town. Many people have died from overdoses. We have many resources to help people with addiction. These resources include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends of people with addiction.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son has special needs, but he is happy at school. He is treated well and does not get bullied. Our school has many events to help families and students. They give free food to all students. This way, no child has to go hungry. The town council and staff have fixed many roads and parks in our town. They also planted nice gardens. But most of these changes are in the center of town and the west side. This is where the shopping areas are. My neighborhood, on the east side, is still a little neglected.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are many stores to buy things we need. Our home is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are around me. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across from the theater is a small bar with games. People like to go there on warm nights. There is a long line of people waiting to get in.\n\nA few blocks away is a big city park. It is near my neighborhood. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are many stairs in the wall. In cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and the stairs. It is hard to stay warm in the rain. But they stay close together in the center of town. They are near a place where they can wash and take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the hills. I like the people. Many years ago, my neighborhood was a bad place. There was much crime. The government and police came to clean up the streets. But the people remember. They still tell stories about those times. The people work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say I should not walk around at night. They say it is not safe. But I think this is old thinking. Maybe people think I am like them. I am also aware of the problems in the world. We have problems with racism and not understanding each other. But my neighborhood is different. People are kind to me. They offer me their jackets when I am cold. They help me when I need it. They tell me I am beautiful and valuable. This is why I love my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, America. This town is different from big cities. We do not have big shopping centers like Wal-mart or Target. We do not have big restaurants like Applebee's. If we need something, we must drive to get it. But our town is very beautiful. We are surrounded by water. We have a big lake called Lake Michigan to one side. We also have another big lake called Lake Charlevoix to the other side. We can find a beach to swim in everywhere we go. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Many houses have basements. People can see the basements from the street. Most houses have aluminum siding. The houses in my neighborhood are every color you can think of. Many houses have yards with trampolines and play equipment. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The people in my town work hard to make a living. They are raising families or have raised families. On any day, you can see children playing in the streets. You can also see people walking dogs, riding bikes, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors. We can tell who is new and who is not. We wave and smile at each other. The lawns are kept clean. We do not leave leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and looked after. People take care of their plants and bushes. Our neighborhood is not perfect. It is a good place to live because it is quiet and safe. We have a sheriff's department and a health department near us. We also have a place to recycle and a park where people can play baseball and softball. We have a small airport near the park. We can hear the planes taking off and landing. We can walk to get ice cream and other things we need. My children can ride their bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood is very different. Different kinds of buildings are near each other - homes and businesses. Some businesses are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new restaurants to eat at and stores to buy things in. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and new. They are in malls and on streets. These streets are close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. People take their young children to these parks. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. We have a community for people who like same-sex relationships. We also have a community for Orthodox Jews and people who came from the Soviet Union. There are many people from different countries and cultures in our city. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are a few miles from my home. But driving a few miles can take a long time because of traffic. Many people in my city do not walk. They like to drive. Our city is very busy and has bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. Many new buildings are being built in our city. This is because many people are moving here. Some people are unhappy about this. They do not want more people and cars. There are many kinds of homes in our city. Some people live in big apartment buildings. Others live in houses or smaller apartment buildings. Some homes are for one family. Others are for two families. My neighborhood is also different. People of many ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a close community like we used to be. When I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We were all friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has many houses. Most are for one family. Some houses are split into two, but still connected. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway on one side. It looks like many houses in America from a long time ago. That was the American dream. Many people wanted to live in a place like this. But now, the dream is not the same. Many people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice. But families still live here. Children play. There is a school here. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes children think about their future. It makes older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not full. People like to play basketball. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by an Arab family. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football. They stop when cars come by. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know their neighbors. There was a school for karate. But when people stopped watching karate movies, children stopped wanting to study karate. Now it is a store that sells medicine. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies. People like to go there because it is cheap. The youth do not like it, but older people do. There is a highway near my town. We do not have an exit for the highway. People wanted to make an exit, but the older people did not want it. They said it would hurt the town. So, the city said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is behind a shopping center, not a place people usually think of living. But if you look closely, you will see a community. Behind the old shopping center and some hotels, you will find people living in small buildings called apartments. These buildings are next to each other like dolls in a row. Some of these buildings have problems, so we will not talk about them. The other buildings are different. Across the street is a college for students. It is quiet and sleepy. Students walk in at 7 in the morning with coffee. The gates creak open and close slowly. Commuters honk their horns and get upset when they have to wait. The road divides into two streets. One side has a park. There is a place to fix broken bones next to the park. The building has a nice porch and a fan that blows air. Children play in the park. They run and play on the grass. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. They talk to each other about boys and TV shows. There is a restaurant with cheap food. There is a store to buy things for swimming. There is a place to get your nails done. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Young people eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards. This neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is a part of history that does not change much.",
            "We were driving through many fields of corn. My friend asked, \"Where is everything?\" I said, \"This is it!\" I knew she would be surprised by the open space. She was from a city where a store was near her house. She had never seen so much open land.\n\nI told her about growing up in a small town in Ohio. I shared with her what life was like. She was surprised to learn about my home. We were on a country road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water. The next place was my home. The houses were made of brick and a hard, rough material called stucco. Each house had a big piece of land that people liked to take care of.\n\nIn the spring, flowers were everywhere. The trees changed colors with the seasons. People had nice cars. They were shiny and clean after a good wash. As we continued down the road, I saw a friendly neighbor. He was always outside cutting his grass and singing. Everyone liked to laugh at him, but he was a kind person. He was a doctor a long time ago. Now he is older and not as funny. \n\nMy house was next. There were geese in the side yard. They ran from a dog. In the back, there was a small stream. You could hear frogs and cows from the farms nearby. Across a bridge made of wood was a special place. The trees, herbs, and flowers grew there naturally. I spent much of my childhood in this place. I built forts and played with friends. In the winter, the yard was empty and the trees were bare. But it was beautiful. The snow made a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and angels. We had a lot of fun.\n\nWe would fight as kids, but in the winter, we made snowballs and built shelters. We were happy and did not worry about anything. We were just kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is different from other places. Some people think this slogan reminds us of the past. The past Portland was less known and less expensive. It had many creative and unique groups of people. Now, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes. But Portland is still weird.\n\nWeird means accepting of things that are not normal. But it does not mean Portland does not have modern things. We buy things from other countries, like China. Portland has many ways of being weird. Some people like yoga and some like business. We all like to have fun. My neighborhood is colorful. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables in every yard. In the summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are things people are giving away. They can be clothes, books, or other things. You never know what you might find.\n\nWalking through the neighborhood is fun. Portland is full of people who like different things. Some people go to yoga with goats, and some go to soccer games. Portland has people who chase their dreams. Some people like to spend time at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland has problems. We have a problem with drugs. This is often caused by mental health problems. The cloud and rain in Portland do not help. We also have a homelessness problem. Our services are good, but not enough.

I can rest my worried mind and keep moving forward.\n\nI moved here when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing that caught my attention. The university has many nice buildings and trees. But the mountains are special. They are the most beautiful things here.\n\nThe town is also very nice. There are many cafes where I studied for many hours. The town has a mix of old and new things. The old buildings are very beautiful. I can walk or take the bus to the main street. The street is busy and fun. But I can also escape to a quiet place near the library.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is busy and quiet at the same time. This makes it very interesting. I have many happy memories here. I remember walking with my friends in the park. I also remember running to the movie theater.\n\nBut the town also has sad memories. Everyone has sad times in life. I cried by the pond many times. I thought about my life and my future. I saw the turtles and ducks living their lives. I wondered about my own life. But then I looked up and saw the mountains. They are strong and steady. They reminded me to keep going.\n\nI walked to the main street. The sun was shining. The mountains were in front of me. They were beautiful. They told me to keep moving forward. They reminded me to be strong.",
            "Bensonhurst is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. You can easily find it. The public transportation system is very good. Many people use it. Bensonhurst is a busy area. You will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asians live here. Over the past 20 years, many Asians moved to Bensonhurst. Now, you see an Asian store on every block. These stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores. They have good food at low prices. It is also very easy to buy things. I live near here. There are four Asian stores within two minutes of each other. This is very convenient.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asians. Many immigrants and their families live here. Some businesses are owned by Asians, but there are others too. There is a park near here. It has basketball courts, a big field for sports, and a playground for children. People of all kinds visit the park and play together. Bensonhurst has many small homes and co-op buildings. Most people live in two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but can be noisy. They often drive quickly and play loud music. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is generally safe, but some people may cause trouble. I personally had a problem here in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But here, many people do not follow the rules. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. Everything slopes downhill and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many runners like to exercise there. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road is bumpy in some places and can be hard to drive on.\n\nSome of the wires on the street are old and broken. It rains a lot here and branches break the wires. The workers fix them, but the repairs look messy. There are many tall trees around my home. But many people don't like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay.\n\nIt is beautiful when the sun sets. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy, so we see the sun through a mist. Most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: cars, houses, and fences. I once left my car outside for a month and it was covered in moss. It took three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The school is close, but most people are older and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often in people's yards or running down the street. If you leave a door open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits run around the area. They are big and the gardeners don't like them because they dig up the plants. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We also see small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my home, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not big, but the rocks by the water are fun to throw into the ocean. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other shoreline even when it is misty.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is between two main roads, so there is more traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. We know most of our neighbors. They work in their yards and homes every day. In the winter, we sled on a nearby hill.\n\nI live in a house at the corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We know their cars. When we see a strange car, we notice it. Some people walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We are usually at home because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife, two daughters, and me.\n\nWe go outside and play. We even play in the rain. Sometimes we cook outside on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool and there are leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood.\n\nOn holidays, our neighborhood is quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see our neighbors with their families. Cars park on the street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. It is a dry and hot place. There is dirt everywhere. If you live here, you see brown all the time. When you see a green lawn, you know the person is working hard to take care of it. \n\nI lived here in the 1990s. Houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. But it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing in the same way. \n\nThe people in my neighborhood are friendly. But some areas are not so good. I have old friends around me, and I like this neighborhood. We have big stores, like Food for Less and Smart. But we do not have many small, special stores. \n\nIf you want to buy something special, you have to drive far. We do not have stores like Whole Foods. \n\nMost people work in construction. The city is not fully developed, so there is a lot of space to build. This worries me. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. \n\nI work in the construction field. I install drywall and T-bars. \n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many types of animals. We should respect the animals and the environment. \n\nI have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them. \n\nWe have some fun things to do in our town. Victorville is a good place for families. We have a big event called the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You should visit us and see the snow in Wrightwood and take a winter sports lesson. If you like learning about the desert, go to the Victor Valley Museum. It has many cool things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is different from others. I do not live in a normal neighborhood. I live on a college campus. My home is a dormitory. My community is the people who live with me in the dormitory and the people on the campus.\n\nMy neighborhood has homes, people, stores and a park. But it is not like other neighborhoods. My neighborhood has apartments, houses and dormitory buildings. \n\nThere are three kinds of homes. One kind is an apartment. In an apartment, 2-4 people live in a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors. It can have 20 people.\n\nAnother kind is a house. These houses are for people who go to the school. They are 2-4 rooms. Some alumni live in these houses.\n\nThe third kind is a dormitory. Many students live in a dormitory. Each room has 2 people. Some rooms have only one person.\n\nPeople from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. The staff lives in houses. New students live in dormitories. Older students live in apartments.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. You can buy food, clothes and other things. My neighborhood also has a park. It is a safe place for everyone. The park is clean and has no crime.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here from Riverdale. I missed my old home and my friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. They wanted us to live in a better place. It had a good school and nice houses.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and some new enemies at school. I got to know my neighbors a little. Mr. Glen and his kids are nice people. They are like a family to me. I like them very much. They got married, and I went to their wedding. It was fun.\n\nMr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw away her leg bandage. I caught it! I also like to hang out with their daughter Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze. I have a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I have been with my friends Kason and Curtis. We like to play video games and have fun together.\n\nI also like to go to the park. It is peaceful and calm. I bring sticks and practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword and practice fighting. I have fun doing what I love. The neighborhood has a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but it was fun.\n\nI have had many happy times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. But these are the ones that I remember best. I think the best is yet to come.",
            "My home is near the college where I go to school. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are here too. They are not very expensive. One bar is new. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people here are students or they have low incomes. They live here because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children here too. There is a school near my home.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put a special machine near their door to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but the inside is new. Down the street, there are new apartments. But they are not good quality. They are cheap, but the rent is expensive. I do not like this.\n\nNear my home, there is a restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. It is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my home. Now it is nicer.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. Some of the trees were cut down. But there are still many trees here. Behind my building, there are trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken and the buildings are old. There are many trees on this street. This is to hide how bad the buildings look.\n\nThere is crime in my area. It happens at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I do not blame just them. There is crime at another apartment complex across from me too. But I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is near and there are two buses to take me to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has many houses on a street that ends in a circle. The houses look like separate homes. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people are friendly, but not all. We stand on our driveways at night and talk to each other. We see children playing with toys, drawing with chalk, or flying kites. This is nice in a world with many machines. It feels like the past. We live near fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. However, we have a problem. This season, we have had tornado warnings. One night, there was a tornado. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for loud hail. The hail fell to the ground. When the storm ended, the road was hot. It was 92 degrees outside, but quickly became 75 degrees. The hail melted on the hot ground. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I ran inside and took pictures. My friends and family were amazed, just like me. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then, people came home from where they were when the storm started. It was business as usual. People were cooking dinner, and children were playing. I love living here. I moved here from a place in New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. My apartment is nice, but not all apartments are the same. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I also like to visit the pond. I have seen deer and heard a big bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It feels like I am living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was going into eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. But I became friends with someone who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not my friends anymore, but I still remember them. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other neighborhoods in America. There are many houses with two floors. I hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. You can leave your packages outside and they will be safe. I trust my neighbors. There is a park very close to my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball and football with the other kids in the neighborhood. But I also hurt my nose playing football. Now I go to the park with my cousin's young children. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food online and have it delivered to their homes. There are also many fast food places and pizza shops. There are stores with everything you need. You can find dry cleaners and a place to buy medicine. There is a grocery store and other shops. One store is owned by an Indian family. I like my neighborhood. Reading about problems with neighbors on social media makes me happy to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. This town is famous for peaches. It is called Johnston. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the town's entrance.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. Most of the land is used for peach trees or cattle. Houses are not very close to each other. They are mostly two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep people cool in the summer. Others have gray shingles.\n\nPeople who live outside the town center have their houses far from the road. They use the front fields for animals and crops. In the town center, there is a traffic light that helps cars move safely. This is where you can find the town's stores.\n\nThere are three places to eat quickly. One is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. The town has a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola.\n\nThere is a small grocery store called IGA. This store sells food and other things. But many people go to a big store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things and is very busy.\n\nThe town has a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman. She has been there for a long time. She also has people who will help move the furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThere are two small doctor's offices and a veterinary clinic outside the town center. They help the people who live in Johnston. The town has a small school called Johnston Elementary School. When the students are older, they go to school in the next town. The town is small and does not have many parks. But they are making a new park now. This will give families a place to go and visit.\n\nThe town is not very big. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to walk pets. But it is a nice town. You can drive by it quickly without noticing it is there.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. The news surprised me. It said that many apartments cost over one thousand dollars a month. I did not know anything about this story. My friends did not either. Life is hard here. Some of my friends cry at night because they are very poor. But we have learned to save money. We like old things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might smoke or get used to our situation. The city has a lot of old things. We have flea markets and thrift stores. There are three thrift stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two stores that sell used things, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are very crowded, but the thrift stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city gets more crowded. Many cars and people go there. It is a growing city. They say it is like New York. Everyone is busy and does not ask for help. You can be alone if you want. People will leave you alone. This is different from the South. In the South, if you care about someone, you want to know what is wrong. Here, people do not ask questions. You can be yourself for a long time. The city is lively. There is always music coming from the house next door or the people upstairs who sing. We are like a community. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone is sad. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are nice. We help each other. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too. I live in a big apartment complex, but my neighbors make me feel happy.",
            "I live in a common kind of neighborhood. It has many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association takes care of the area. The houses are well-maintained. They all have a small garden in front. There are also some decorative stones and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are in good shape. You will not see any big holes on the road.\n\nMost houses have one floor. Some have two floors. We do not have a mailbox in front of each house. We have a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to get their mail. There are also two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. It is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many community pools. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails. You can walk your dog or go for a walk alone. The neighborhood is big. You can run around and get some exercise. Most people who live here are old. The area is safe. Everyone helps each other.\n\nSome people are middle-aged or young professionals. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things you need. For example, we have a big store called a mall. It is not very big, but it has everything you need. I can drive to any store in about 15 minutes. There are many stores with good food, cheap stores, and more.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things like pools and walking trails. We are not close to many stores, but we can drive to them easily.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city, but not in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Houses here are not very valuable. People who live here usually rent or own these houses. They are low-income people. \n\nMy neighborhood is not ugly. People here are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of the town. But they are still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. These crimes include shootings and one person was killed. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by crime, except for sometimes items disappearing from our porch.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. It is called the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people in the US have this problem. It is a big issue in our town. Many people have died from overdoses. We have many resources to help people with addiction. These resources include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends of people with addiction.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son has special needs, but he is happy at school. He is treated well and does not get bullied. Our school has many events to help families and students. They give free food to all students. This way, no child has to go hungry. The town council and staff have fixed many roads and parks in our town. They also planted nice gardens. But most of these changes are in the center of town and the west side. This is where the shopping areas are. My neighborhood, on the east side, is still a little neglected.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are many stores to buy things we need. Our home is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are around me. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across from the theater is a small bar with games. People like to go there on warm nights. There is a long line of people waiting to get in.\n\nA few blocks away is a big city park. It is near my neighborhood. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are many stairs in the wall. In cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and the stairs. It is hard to stay warm in the rain. But they stay close together in the center of town. They are near a place where they can wash and take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the hills. I like the people. Many years ago, my neighborhood was a bad place. There was much crime. The government and police came to clean up the streets. But the people remember. They still tell stories about those times. The people work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say I should not walk around at night. They say it is not safe. But I think this is old thinking. Maybe people think I am like them. I am also aware of the problems in the world. We have problems with racism and not understanding each other. But my neighborhood is different. People are kind to me. They offer me their jackets when I am cold. They help me when I need it. They tell me I am beautiful and valuable. This is why I love my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, America. This town is different from big cities. We do not have big shopping centers like Wal-mart or Target. We do not have big restaurants like Applebee's. If we need something, we must drive to get it. But our town is very beautiful. We are surrounded by water. We have a big lake called Lake Michigan to one side. We also have another big lake called Lake Charlevoix to the other side. We can find a beach to swim in everywhere we go. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Many houses have basements. People can see the basements from the street. Most houses have aluminum siding. The houses in my neighborhood are every color you can think of. Many houses have yards with trampolines and play equipment. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The people in my town work hard to make a living. They are raising families or have raised families. On any day, you can see children playing in the streets. You can also see people walking dogs, riding bikes, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors. We can tell who is new and who is not. We wave and smile at each other. The lawns are kept clean. We do not leave leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and looked after. People take care of their plants and bushes. Our neighborhood is not perfect. It is a good place to live because it is quiet and safe. We have a sheriff's department and a health department near us. We also have a place to recycle and a park where people can play baseball and softball. We have a small airport near the park. We can hear the planes taking off and landing. We can walk to get ice cream and other things we need. My children can ride their bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood is very different. Different kinds of buildings are near each other - homes and businesses. Some businesses are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new restaurants to eat at and stores to buy things in. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small and new. They are in malls and on streets. These streets are close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. People take their young children to these parks. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. We have a community for people who like same-sex relationships. We also have a community for Orthodox Jews and people who came from the Soviet Union. There are many people from different countries and cultures in our city. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are a few miles from my home. But driving a few miles can take a long time because of traffic. Many people in my city do not walk. They like to drive. Our city is very busy and has bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. Many new buildings are being built in our city. This is because many people are moving here. Some people are unhappy about this. They do not want more people and cars. There are many kinds of homes in our city. Some people live in big apartment buildings. Others live in houses or smaller apartment buildings. Some homes are for one family. Others are for two families. My neighborhood is also different. People of many ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a close community like we used to be. When I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We were all friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has many houses. Most are for one family. Some houses are split into two, but still connected. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway on one side. It looks like many houses in America from a long time ago. That was the American dream. Many people wanted to live in a place like this. But now, the dream is not the same. Many people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice. But families still live here. Children play. There is a school here. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes children think about their future. It makes older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not full. People like to play basketball. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by an Arab family. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football. They stop when cars come by. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know their neighbors. There was a school for karate. But when people stopped watching karate movies, children stopped wanting to study karate. Now it is a store that sells medicine. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies. People like to go there because it is cheap. The youth do not like it, but older people do. There is a highway near my town. We do not have an exit for the highway. People wanted to make an exit, but the older people did not want it. They said it would hurt the town. So, the city said no. We are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is behind a shopping center, not a place people usually think of living. But if you look closely, you will see a community. Behind the old shopping center and some hotels, you will find people living in small buildings called apartments. These buildings are next to each other like dolls in a row. Some of these buildings have problems, so we will not talk about them. The other buildings are different. Across the street is a college for students. It is quiet and sleepy. Students walk in at 7 in the morning with coffee. The gates creak open and close slowly. Commuters honk their horns and get upset when they have to wait. The road divides into two streets. One side has a park. There is a place to fix broken bones next to the park. The building has a nice porch and a fan that blows air. Children play in the park. They run and play on the grass. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. They talk to each other about boys and TV shows. There is a restaurant with cheap food. There is a store to buy things for swimming. There is a place to get your nails done. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Young people eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards. This neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is a part of history that does not change much.",
            "We were driving through many fields of corn. My friend asked, \"Where is everything?\" I said, \"This is it!\" I knew she would be surprised by the open space. She was from a city where a store was near her house. She had never seen so much open land.\n\nI told her about growing up in a small town in Ohio. I shared with her what life was like. She was surprised to learn about my home. We were on a country road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water. The next place was my home. The houses were made of brick and a hard, rough material called stucco. Each house had a big piece of land that people liked to take care of.\n\nIn the spring, flowers were everywhere. The trees changed colors with the seasons. People had nice cars. They were shiny and clean after a good wash. As we continued down the road, I saw a friendly neighbor. He was always outside cutting his grass and singing. Everyone liked to laugh at him, but he was a kind person. He was a doctor a long time ago. Now he is older and not as funny. \n\nMy house was next. There were geese in the side yard. They ran from a dog. In the back, there was a small stream. You could hear frogs and cows from the farms nearby. Across a bridge made of wood was a special place. The trees, herbs, and flowers grew there naturally. I spent much of my childhood in this place. I built forts and played with friends. In the winter, the yard was empty and the trees were bare. But it was beautiful. The snow made a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and angels. We had a lot of fun.\n\nWe would fight as kids, but in the winter, we made snowballs and built shelters. We were happy and did not worry about anything. We were just kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is different from other places. Some people think this slogan reminds us of the past. The past Portland was less known and less expensive. It had many creative and unique groups of people. Now, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes. But Portland is still weird.\n\nWeird means accepting of things that are not normal. But it does not mean Portland does not have modern things. We buy things from other countries, like China. Portland has many ways of being weird. Some people like yoga and some like business. We all like to have fun. My neighborhood is colorful. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables in every yard. In the summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are things people are giving away. They can be clothes, books, or other things. You never know what you might find.\n\nWalking through the neighborhood is fun. Portland is full of people who like different things. Some people go to yoga with goats, and some go to soccer games. Portland has people who chase their dreams. Some people like to spend time at the bar. Unfortunately, Portland has problems. We have a problem with drugs. This is often caused by mental health problems. The cloud and rain in Portland do not help. We also have a homelessness problem. Our services are good, but not enough. The community is divided. Some people care for the homeless, but some people are angry.",
            "The mountains are always there. They see the sun every morning and evening. I forget about them many times. But they are always there. They do not change. They do not get angry or sad. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, the mountains remind me to look at them. When I see them, I feel better. They give me the strength to keep going. I can rest my worried mind and keep moving forward.\n\nI moved here when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing that caught my attention. The university has many nice buildings and trees. But the mountains are special. They are the most beautiful things here.\n\nThe town is also very nice. There are many cafes where I studied for many hours. The town has a mix of old and new things. The old buildings are very beautiful. I can walk or take the bus to the main street. The street is busy and fun. But I can also escape to a quiet place near the library.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is busy and quiet at the same time. This makes it very interesting. I have many happy memories here. I remember walking with my friends in the park. I also remember running to the movie theater.\n\nBut the town also has sad memories. Everyone has sad times in life. I cried by the pond many times. I thought about my life and my future. I saw the turtles and ducks living their lives. I wondered about my own life. But then I looked up and saw the mountains. They are strong and steady. They reminded me to keep going.\n\nI walked to the main street. The sun was shining. The mountains were in front of me. They were beautiful. They told me to keep moving forward. They reminded me to be strong.",
            "Bensonhurst is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. You can easily find it. The public transportation system is very good. Many people use it. Bensonhurst is a busy area. You will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asians live here. Over the past 20 years, many Asians moved to Bensonhurst. Now, you see an Asian store on every block. These stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores. They have good food at low prices. It is also very easy to buy things. I live near here. There are four Asian stores within two minutes of each other. This is very convenient.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asians. Many immigrants and their families live here. Some businesses are owned by Asians, but there are others too. There is a park near here. It has basketball courts, a big field for sports, and a playground for children. People of all kinds visit the park and play together. Bensonhurst has many small homes and co-op buildings. Most people live in two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but can be noisy. They often drive quickly and play loud music. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is generally safe, but some people may cause trouble. I personally had a problem here in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But here, many people do not follow the rules. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every morning. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. Everything slopes downhill and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many runners like to exercise there. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk on the road. The road is bumpy in some places and can be hard to drive on.\n\nSome of the wires on the street are old and broken. It rains a lot here and branches break the wires. The workers fix them, but the repairs look messy. There are many tall trees around my home. But many people don't like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay.\n\nIt is beautiful when the sun sets. The water shines and the sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy, so we see the sun through a mist. Most days are cloudy and damp. Moss grows on everything: cars, houses, and fences. I once left my car outside for a month and it was covered in moss. It took three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The school is close, but most people are older and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often in people's yards or running down the street. If you leave a door open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits run around the area. They are big and the gardeners don't like them because they dig up the plants. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We also see small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my home, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not big, but the rocks by the water are fun to throw into the ocean. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other shoreline even when it is misty.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is between two main roads, so there is more traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. We know most of our neighbors. They work in their yards and homes every day. In the winter, we sled on a nearby hill.\n\nI live in a house at the corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We know their cars. When we see a strange car, we notice it. Some people walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We are usually at home because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife, two daughters, and me.\n\nWe go outside and play. We even play in the rain. Sometimes we cook outside on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. Our neighborhood has many trees, so it is cool and there are leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood.\n\nOn holidays, our neighborhood is quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see our neighbors with their families. Cars park on the street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the desert. It is a dry and hot place. There is dirt everywhere. If you live here, you see brown all the time. When you see a green lawn, you know the person is working hard to take care of it. \n\nI lived here in the 1990s. Houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. But it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing in the same way. \n\nThe people in my neighborhood are friendly. But some areas are not so good. I have old friends around me, and I like this neighborhood. We have big stores, like Food for Less and Smart. But we do not have many small, special stores. \n\nIf you want to buy something special, you have to drive far. We do not have stores like Whole Foods. \n\nMost people work in construction. The city is not fully developed, so there is a lot of space to build. This worries me. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. \n\nI work in the construction field. I install drywall and T-bars. \n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many types of animals. We should respect the animals and the environment. \n\nI have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them. \n\nWe have some fun things to do in our town. Victorville is a good place for families. We have a big event called the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You should visit us and see the snow in Wrightwood and take a winter sports lesson. If you like learning about the desert, go to the Victor Valley Museum. It has many cool things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is different from others. I do not live in a normal neighborhood. I live on a college campus. My home is a dormitory. My community is the people who live with me in the dormitory and the people on the campus.\n\nMy neighborhood has homes, people, stores and a park. But it is not like other neighborhoods. My neighborhood has apartments, houses and dormitory buildings. \n\nThere are three kinds of homes. One kind is an apartment. In an apartment, 2-4 people live in a room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors. It can have 20 people.\n\nAnother kind is a house. These houses are for people who go to the school. They are 2-4 rooms. Some alumni live in these houses.\n\nThe third kind is a dormitory. Many students live in a dormitory. Each room has 2 people. Some rooms have only one person.\n\nPeople from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. The staff lives in houses. New students live in dormitories. Older students live in apartments.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. You can buy food, clothes and other things. My neighborhood also has a park. It is a safe place for everyone. The park is clean and has no crime.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here from Riverdale. I missed my old home and my friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. They wanted us to live in a better place. It had a good school and nice houses.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and some new enemies at school. I got to know my neighbors a little. Mr. Glen and his kids are nice people. They are like a family to me. I like them very much. They got married, and I went to their wedding. It was fun.\n\nMr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, threw away her leg bandage. I caught it! I also like to hang out with their daughter Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze. I have a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I have been with my friends Kason and Curtis. We like to play video games and have fun together.\n\nI also like to go to the park. It is peaceful and calm. I bring sticks and practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword and practice fighting. I have fun doing what I love. The neighborhood has a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but it was fun.\n\nI have had many happy times in this neighborhood. I have many stories. But these are the ones that I remember best. I think the best is yet to come.",
            "My home is near the college where I go to school. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are here too. They are not very expensive. One bar is new. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people here are students or they have low incomes. They live here because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children here too. There is a school near my home.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The management put a special machine near their door to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but the inside is new. Down the street, there are new apartments. But they are not good quality. They are cheap, but the rent is expensive. I do not like this.\n\nNear my home, there is a restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. It is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my home. Now it is nicer.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. Some of the trees were cut down. But there are still many trees here. Behind my building, there are trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken and the buildings are old. There are many trees on this street. This is to hide how bad the buildings look.\n\nThere is crime in my area. It happens at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I do not blame just them. There is crime at another apartment complex across from me too. But I like where I live. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is near and there are two buses to take me to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has many houses on a street that ends in a circle. The houses look like separate homes. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people are friendly, but not all. We stand on our driveways at night and talk to each other. We see children playing with toys, drawing with chalk, or flying kites. This is nice in a world with many machines. It feels like the past. We live near fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. However, we have a problem. This season, we have had tornado warnings. One night, there was a tornado. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for loud hail. The hail fell to the ground. When the storm ended, the road was hot. It was 92 degrees outside, but quickly became 75 degrees. The hail melted on the hot ground. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I ran inside and took pictures. My friends and family were amazed, just like me. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then, people came home from where they were when the storm started. It was business as usual. People were cooking dinner, and children were playing. I love living here. I moved here from a place in New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk in the South. My apartment is nice, but not all apartments are the same. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I also like to visit the pond. I have seen deer and heard a big bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live, 40 minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It feels like I am living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was going into eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first. But I became friends with someone who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not my friends anymore, but I still remember them. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other neighborhoods in America. There are many houses with two floors. I hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. You can leave your packages outside and they will be safe. I trust my neighbors. There is a park very close to my house. I have many happy memories there. I played basketball and football with the other kids in the neighborhood. But I also hurt my nose playing football. Now I go to the park with my cousin's young children. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time. My neighborhood is different. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food online and have it delivered to their homes. There are also many fast food places and pizza shops. There are stores with everything you need. You can find dry cleaners and a place to buy medicine. There is a grocery store and other shops. One store is owned by an Indian family. I like my neighborhood. Reading about problems with neighbors on social media makes me happy to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. This town is famous for peaches. It is called Johnston. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the town's entrance.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. Most of the land is used for peach trees or cattle. Houses are not very close to each other. They are mostly two stories high. Some have metal roofs to keep people cool in the summer. Others have gray shingles.\n\nPeople who live outside the town center have their houses far from the road. They use the front fields for animals and crops. In the town center, there is a traffic light that helps cars move safely. This is where you can find the town's stores.\n\nThere are three places to eat quickly. One is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. Another is a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. The third is a burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. The town has a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for selling Cherry Coca-Cola.\n\nThere is a small grocery store called IGA. This store sells food and other things. But many people go to a big store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things and is very busy.\n\nThe town has a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman. She has been there for a long time. She also has people who will help move the furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThere are two small doctor's offices and a veterinary clinic outside the town center. They help the people who live in Johnston. The town has a small school called Johnston Elementary School. When the students are older, they go to school in the next town. The town is small and does not have many parks. But they are making a new park now. This will give families a place to go and visit.\n\nThe town is not very big. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places to walk pets. But it is a nice town. You can drive by it quickly without noticing it is there.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. The news surprised me. It said that many apartments cost over one thousand dollars a month. I did not know anything about this story. My friends did not either. Life is hard here. Some of my friends cry at night because they are very poor. But we have learned to save money. We like old things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might smoke or get used to our situation. The city has a lot of old things. We have flea markets and thrift stores. There are three thrift stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two stores that sell used things, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are very crowded, but the thrift stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city gets more crowded. Many cars and people go there. It is a growing city. They say it is like New York. Everyone is busy and does not ask for help. You can be alone if you want. People will leave you alone. This is different from the South. In the South, if you care about someone, you want to know what is wrong. Here, people do not ask questions. You can be yourself for a long time. The city is lively. There is always music coming from the house next door or the people upstairs who sing. We are like a community. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone is sad. I am lucky to live here. My neighbors are nice. We help each other. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too. I live in a big apartment complex, but my neighbors make me feel happy.",
            "I live in a common kind of neighborhood. It has many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association takes care of the area. The houses are well-maintained. They all have a small garden in front. There are also some decorative stones and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. The roads are in good shape. You will not see any big holes on the road.\n\nMost houses have one floor. Some have two floors. We do not have a mailbox in front of each house. We have a big group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to get their mail. There are also two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. It is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many community pools. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails. You can walk your dog or go for a walk alone. The neighborhood is big. You can run around and get some exercise. Most people who live here are old. The area is safe. Everyone helps each other.\n\nSome people are middle-aged or young professionals. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things you need. For example, we have a big store called a mall. It is not very big, but it has everything you need. I can drive to any store in about 15 minutes. There are many stores with good food, cheap stores, and more.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things like pools and walking trails. We are not close to many stores, but we can drive to them easily.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city, but not in the suburbs. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Houses here are not very valuable. People who live here usually rent or own these houses. They are low-income people. \n\nMy neighborhood is not ugly. People here are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime rates are a little higher here than in other parts of the town. But they are still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. These crimes include shootings and one person was killed. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by crime, except for sometimes items disappearing from our porch.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. It is called the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people in the US have this problem. It is a big issue in our town. Many people have died from overdoses. We have many resources to help people with addiction. These resources include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends of people with addiction.\n\nDespite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son has special needs, but he is happy at school. He is treated well and does not get bullied. Our school has many events to help families and students. They give free food to all students. This way, no child has to go hungry. The town council and staff have fixed many roads and parks in our town. They also planted nice gardens. But most of these changes are in the center of town and the west side. This is where the shopping areas are. My neighborhood, on the east side, is still a little neglected.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are many stores to buy things we need. Our home is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are around me. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across from the theater is a small bar with games. People like to go there on warm nights. There is a long line of people waiting to get in.\n\nA few blocks away is a big city park. It is near my neighborhood. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are many stairs in the wall. In cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and the stairs. It is hard to stay warm in the rain. But they stay close together in the center of town. They are near a place where they can wash and take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the hills. I like the people. Many years ago, my neighborhood was a bad place. There was much crime. The government and police came to clean up the streets. But the people remember. They still tell stories about those times. The people work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say I should not walk around at night. They say it is not safe. But I think this is old thinking. Maybe people think I am like them. I am also aware of the problems in the world. We have problems with racism and not understanding each other. But my neighborhood is different. People are kind to me. They offer me their jackets when I am cold. They help me when I need it. They tell me I am beautiful and valuable. This is why I love my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, America. This town is different from big cities. We do not have big shopping centers like Wal-mart or Target. We do not have big restaurants like Applebee's. If we need something, we must drive to get it. But our town is very beautiful. We are surrounded by water. We have a big lake called Lake Michigan to one side. We also have another big lake called Lake Charlevoix to the other side. We can find a beach to swim in everywhere we go. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some houses are old and some are new. Many houses have basements. People can see the basements from the street. Most houses have aluminum siding. The houses in my neighborhood are every color you can think of. Many houses have yards with trampolines and play equipment. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The people in my town work hard to make a living. They are raising families or have raised families. On any day, you can see children playing in the streets. You can also see people walking dogs, riding bikes, or rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors. We can tell who is new and who is not. We wave and smile at each other. The lawns are kept clean. We do not leave leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and looked after. People take care of their plants and bushes. Our neighborhood is not perfect. It is a good place to live because it is quiet and safe. We have a sheriff's department and a health department near us. We also have a place to recycle and a park where people can play baseball and softball. We have a small airport near the park. We can hear the planes taking off and landing. We can walk to get ice cream and other things we need. My children can ride their bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live."
