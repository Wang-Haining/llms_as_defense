            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

It is a good place to make memories. I have happy memories of walking with friends or going to the movies. I also have sad memories. We all have sad times in our lives. The ponds can be a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walk around the town and think about my life. I see the turtles and ducks and insects. They live their lives. I think about my life and try to find my purpose. I walk to a main street. The sun is shining. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They tell me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It is not hard to find. Many people use public transportation. This is because it is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban area. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nYou will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people live here. Over 20 years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurt. But now there are many Asian-owned stores. You will see one store every few blocks. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and other things. People like them because food is good, prices are low, and it is easy.\n\nNear my house, four Asian supermarkets are close together. This makes it easy to buy groceries. But Bensonhurt is not all Asian people. It is also home to people from other countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. It has basketball courts, a big open space, and swings for kids. People can play and be happy here.\n\nMost homes in Bensonhurt are small houses. There are not many big office buildings. But the people here are friendly. They are a little loud. Cars are often driving by with music on. This can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was a victim of mean behavior a long time ago. Recently, people have been stealing packages. And some people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. I do not like this.",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. The houses are on a big hill, and the road is very steep. People call this hill the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it every day. There is no sidewalk on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. It has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. The telephone and electricity wires are old and look bad. Sometimes big trees fall on the wires and cause problems. We have a lot of rain and storms, so the wires look like they need repair.\n\nThe neighborhood has many tall green trees. But people do not like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the water. It's pretty when the sun sets and the water shines. But it often rains and the sun is hidden by clouds. The days are often cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. Most people are older and have retired. They have dogs, not kids. You often see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave your door open, they might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have wild rabbits. They are big and dig up plants. People do not like them. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We have birds too, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chases it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is between two main roads, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move here. I know most of the people who live near me. They take care of their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we slide down a nearby hill on our street. We live on the first corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. My wife and I have two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are at home a lot. We like to go outside and play. We also grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but a lot of leaves fall in the fall. We must rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has come. Recent winters have been mild. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. Some families visit from other places on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Many cars are parked on our street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. It is very dry here. You see a lot of dirt and brown things. People know it is hard to take care of a green lawn in this place. When I moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, the houses are still far apart, but more houses have been added. The town is starting to look like a city. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. Some places are good, and some are not. I like where I live because the people are nice. The stores in my town are almost all chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people in my town work in construction. The town is still growing, and there is a lot of space to build. This is a little scary for me. I like my town the way it is. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to the desert for many reasons, like the beauty of the desert. We must learn about the animals that live here to live in peace. My family loves the animals. My kids like catching lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can experience the desert in a new way. If you can, come to our town for our fair. It is a fun event with many activities. Visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski. If you like learning about the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American things that tell us about how people lived here.",
            "I live in a college campus. My neighborhood is not like other neighborhoods. I live in a dormitory with many other students. They are my community. The campus is my neighborhood too. It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on my campus. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2 to 4 people live together in a room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Two floors make one building. Usually, 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They are for students and alumni. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. There are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitories. They share a room with one other person.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and ages live here. Teachers and staff live in houses. New students live in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a small town. It has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things. We can buy everything we need here. There is a park too. It is a public space for everyone. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place. This new place has a good house, a good school, and is not in a bad area.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies in school. I got to know a few of my neighbors. Mr. Glen and his children are nice people. They are like a second family to me. I like them. One day, my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI caught a piece of Mr. Glen's wife's leg strap when she took it off. I wanted to catch the flowers, but I missed them. We danced and had a good time. One of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii, was there. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she is happy.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to navigate it. I like to explore with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me calm and happy. Sometimes I practice my balance with sticks. I like to bring my wooden sword and have fun.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court in our neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. They made me work hard, but I had fun. I hope I can play again soon.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One new bar is expensive, but the service is good. The people in my neighborhood are friendly. They are mostly college students or people who rent apartments because the rent is not high. There is a school near my home. Many children go there. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. Our building manager put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings near me are old. Some have new insides. Down the street, new apartments were built. But they are not good. They are cheaply made. The rent is high. I do not like this. It is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant, there is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk, grass, and the area looks better.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. The city cut down some trees, but it is still a nice place. Behind my building, there are more trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. But the trees hide the bad buildings. There are apartments near me that have crime problems. But I like living here. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. The university is near and I can take the bus easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a closed street. They are placed apart so they look like separate homes. All the houses are yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Many people know each other and are friends. We stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk to each other. Our children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees under a blue sky with white clouds. But sometimes we have to be careful because of storms. Last night we heard tornado sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some things. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of small balls of ice hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road became very hot. The ice melted quickly when it hit the hot ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures of it. It was very nice. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home. They were quiet for a while, then it was normal again. Children played outside while their mothers cooked dinner.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside, but not inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live. It is near the city of Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this good neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I became close to two friends who lived near me. They are not there now, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs.\n\nMy neighborhood has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when the weather is good. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered things online and no one has ever taken my packages.\n\nI trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played ball games with the other kids. I got hurt one time playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe park makes me happy and sad at the same time. The neighborhood is different from most places. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, and Mexican restaurants. You can also get food delivered from apps like GrubHub.\n\nThe stores near my house have everything I need. There are places to clean my clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. You can buy Indian food at an Indian-owned store if you want. I like my neighborhood. I see bad news on the internet about some people who have problems with their neighbors. I am lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special compared to other towns in the state. But it is important for farming. Johnston is famous for peaches. A big sign at the town's entrance says it is the Peach Capital of the World. The town has a lot of land with peach trees and cows. Houses are far apart and are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. They are back a little bit so people can use the front land for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one big light that controls four streets. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town that sells groceries. But people usually go to Walmart in the next town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. The doctor's office and a veterinarian are not in the middle of town. They are small but can help the people of Johnston. We have one elementary school. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We do not have parks, but we are making a new 2.5-acre park. It will be a nice place for families to have fun and for visitors to come. There is not much to do in town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But Johnston is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast. It was about people who went missing. I was surprised. The apartments in my area cost a lot of money - over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this story. My friends also did not know. Maybe this is the problem. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive. But my friends and I have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might start to smoke or get used to things. But second-hand stores always remind us of home. There are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning. But the second-hand stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It is a growing city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. But it is nice to be here. There is music coming from the piano next door and singing from upstairs. It is always something happening. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We are lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to clean my space and leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company too.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. Many people live here. There is a group called a homeowner's association that helps take care of the neighborhood. This group makes sure the homes are neat and nice.\n\nWhen you enter the neighborhood, you see many single-family homes. They are well-maintained because of the homeowner's association. The front yards are similar. There is a small lawn, some decorative rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage.\n\nThe streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any bad holes in the road. Most homes are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. This area is part rural, part suburban. There is a lot of space. We have many community pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself.\n\nThe neighborhood is big. You can run around it and get some exercise. Many people who live here are retired. This is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some younger people also live here.\n\nOur city is not very big, but it feels small. We have many things that we need. There is one big shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many different stores. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to a big shopping area to find what we need.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is an area with low property values. Many people in this area rent or own their homes with low incomes. But it is not an ugly or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other areas. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. A man was shot outside a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by these problems. Sometimes we lose things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nThe town where I live has a big problem. It is called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from taking too much fentanyl. But we have help for people who need it. There are centers to treat addiction and places to learn how to help loved ones.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are kind. My son has special needs, but he is not bullied. Everyone is friendly at the school. They have many events to help families learn and get involved.\n\nThe school is special. It gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child has to go hungry. The town leaders have made improvements to the city. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and not in our area. We wish they would make changes here too.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is located on a hill. Many buildings with history are around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from the theater is a fun bar where people go on warm summer nights. This bar is popular. Many people want to go in. A short walk from my house is a big park. The park is for the whole city. It is surrounded by concrete and stairs. In the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. They are near a place where they can wash and get warm. This is helpful. They can also walk or take public transportation to a family center where they can get food and help.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the history. I like the people. Many years ago, this neighborhood was very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police tried to make it better. The people remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it. The people work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. They say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is true, but I also think it is unfair. I think it is because of the way some people were treated a long time ago. I am not entirely white. I feel safe here. I like the people who live here. They are kind to me. They keep me safe. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are honest and nice. They will give me money if I need it. They say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. There are farms and small towns. There is no big city with many stores. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live in a very beautiful place near the water. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake called Lake Michigan on one side and another lake, Lake Charlevoix, on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to swim at. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not crowded together. They are not the same, old or new. Some houses are old and have been changed. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are many colors of houses in my neighborhood. Most houses have a yard with a trampoline or a playset. Some people have gardens and animal fences. It is like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and you can tell who is from around here and who is not. You can see someone grilling outside and wave at them. If you see someone walking a dog, you can smile at them. The lawns are well taken care of. There are no leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and kept short. If people have plants, they are kept trimmed. This is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks great from outside. It is a quiet and safe place to live. It is a good place to raise a family. Within walking distance, there is a police department and a health office. There is also a place where people take their trash. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers calling the game. We also have a small airport. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the ice cream shop and to the center of town. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is not far away. This is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. It has many people from different countries and cultures. My neighborhood is not very close together. There are homes and businesses mixed together. Some buildings are offices, and others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the street. The streets are often close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. I see many people with kids in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very different. One area has many people from the LGBTQ+ community, the Jewish faith, and refugees from Russia. Other parts of the city have people from different countries and cultures. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not very far from where I live. But driving is hard because of traffic. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Many people do not walk, even if places are close. Our city is very big, and people prefer to drive. This makes traffic bad, and parking is hard to find. There has been a lot of building in our city. New apartment buildings are being made. Many people are happy, but others do not want more people and cars. We have many different kinds of homes in our city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, small apartments, and condominiums. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are people of all ages. I do not know many of my neighbors. We are not very close to each other. When I was a child, I played with my neighbor and friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. There are many houses. Some houses are for one family. Some houses are divided into two parts, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway. It is like many other houses here.\n\nThese houses remind us of a happy time in the past. Many people thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. But now, not as many people think this way. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. Many people still live here. They still visit here. It makes us think the American dream is still real.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. They think the world is a big place.\n\nThere is a big school near my house. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes young people think about the future. It makes older people remember the past. There are not many churches in my neighborhood. Most of them are empty. But the basketball courts are always full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people in my neighborhood are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play football here. They stop playing when cars come. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school. But kids stopped going there because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap.\n\nThere is a big highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to build an exit in our town. But older people said it would ruin the town. They talked to the city and they said no.\n\nWe are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People don't usually think there are homes here. But if you go behind the old grocery store, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like a line of connected houses. Some apartments have bad news. We don't want to talk about those. Next to them are other buildings. These are a different world. Most people in the area don't know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. It is not the main school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and talk in the morning. People who drive by get angry because they think the students are slowing them down. The street divides into two. There is a park on one side. There is a place where people go to get better after they are hurt. The building has nice furniture. There is a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and play on their skateboards. Old people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers and smile.\n\nThere is a small store where you can buy cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and eat food while you get a manicure. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt. Teenagers like to eat there and play on their skateboards. This is a special place in America. It is a part of history. It is quiet and does not change.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a city. In her city, she could walk to a store in five minutes. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about my hometown. I grew up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. She finally understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We came to a big hole in the ground filled with water. Next to it was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their yards. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. They shine in the sun.\n\nWe kept driving. My neighbor was outside. He was smiling. He was mowing his lawn. He likes to sing. Everyone laughs at him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as funny as he used to be. He blends in with the grass.\n\nWe came to my house. There are geese in the yard. They run from our dog. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. There is a small bridge. On the other side, there is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built tree houses. I chased animals. I played with my friends.\n\nWinters are cold here. But they are also beautiful. The trees are empty and brown. The flowers are gone. When it snows, the yard is very pretty. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs as our weapon. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own little world. We didn't think about anything else. We were just kids having fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that is known as \"weird\". There is a sign in the city that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this idea. They think it is a way to remember the Portland of the past, when it was not as well-known and not as expensive. Others think it is a call to come to Portland, where people will say you are weird, but it is a good thing.\n\nPeople come to Portland from other places, like California. They build houses here, but Portland is still weird. \"Weird\" means accepting things that are not normal. We have modern things like computers and cars. But we also have things that are different. We have people who practice yoga, people who are business leaders, and people who like to be creative.\n\nIn my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. You can find nice clothes, books, and other things in these boxes. Walking through the neighborhood is fun because you never know what you might find.\n\nPortland is a place where people like many things. Some people like to do yoga with goats. Others like to watch the city's soccer team play. We also have people who like to drink beer and socialize. But Portland has problems too. We have a problem with drugs, which is often caused by mental health issues. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. These people come here because we have good services, but our services are not enough.\n\nThe people who live here do not agree on what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. But this is not what makes Portland weird. We are a city with many different kinds of people, and that is what makes us special.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. I forget about them sometimes. I am busy with work and life. But they are always there. They do not change. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw the mountains when I started my college. They are near the campus. The university is beautiful. It has nice buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are special. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes. Students study there for many hours. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feeling. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is a mix of busy and quiet. You can find peace and excitement in the same place.\n\nI like this town. It is a good place to make memories. I have happy memories of walking with friends or going to the movies. I also have sad memories. We all have sad times in our lives. The ponds can be a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walk around the town and think about my life. I see the turtles and ducks and insects. They live their lives. I think about my life and try to find my purpose. I walk to a main street. The sun is shining. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They tell me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It is not hard to find. Many people use public transportation. This is because it is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban area. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nYou will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people live here. Over 20 years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurt. But now there are many Asian-owned stores. You will see one store every few blocks. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and other things. People like them because food is good, prices are low, and it is easy.\n\nNear my house, four Asian supermarkets are close together. This makes it easy to buy groceries. But Bensonhurt is not all Asian people. It is also home to people from other countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. It has basketball courts, a big open space, and swings for kids. People can play and be happy here.\n\nMost homes in Bensonhurt are small houses. There are not many big office buildings. But the people here are friendly. They are a little loud. Cars are often driving by with music on. This can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was a victim of mean behavior a long time ago. Recently, people have been stealing packages. And some people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. I do not like this.",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. The houses are on a big hill, and the road is very steep. People call this hill the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it every day. There is no sidewalk on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. It has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. The telephone and electricity wires are old and look bad. Sometimes big trees fall on the wires and cause problems. We have a lot of rain and storms, so the wires look like they need repair.\n\nThe neighborhood has many tall green trees. But people do not like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the water. It's pretty when the sun sets and the water shines. But it often rains and the sun is hidden by clouds. The days are often cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. Most people are older and have retired. They have dogs, not kids. You often see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave your door open, they might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have wild rabbits. They are big and dig up plants. People do not like them. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We have birds too, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chases it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is between two main roads, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move here. I know most of the people who live near me. They take care of their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we slide down a nearby hill on our street. We live on the first corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. My wife and I have two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are at home a lot. We like to go outside and play. We also grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but a lot of leaves fall in the fall. We must rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has come. Recent winters have been mild. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. Some families visit from other places on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Many cars are parked on our street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. It is very dry here. You see a lot of dirt and brown things. People know it is hard to take care of a green lawn in this place. When I moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, the houses are still far apart, but more houses have been added. The town is starting to look like a city. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. Some places are good, and some are not. I like where I live because the people are nice. The stores in my town are almost all chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people in my town work in construction. The town is still growing, and there is a lot of space to build. This is a little scary for me. I like my town the way it is. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to the desert for many reasons, like the beauty of the desert. We must learn about the animals that live here to live in peace. My family loves the animals. My kids like catching lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can experience the desert in a new way. If you can, come to our town for our fair. It is a fun event with many activities. Visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski. If you like learning about the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American things that tell us about how people lived here.",
            "I live in a college campus. My neighborhood is not like other neighborhoods. I live in a dormitory with many other students. They are my community. The campus is my neighborhood too. It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on my campus. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2 to 4 people live together in a room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Two floors make one building. Usually, 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They are for students and alumni. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. There are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitories. They share a room with one other person.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and ages live here. Teachers and staff live in houses. New students live in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a small town. It has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things. We can buy everything we need here. There is a park too. It is a public space for everyone. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place. This new place has a good house, a good school, and is not in a bad area.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies in school. I got to know a few of my neighbors. Mr. Glen and his children are nice people. They are like a second family to me. I like them. One day, my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI caught a piece of Mr. Glen's wife's leg strap when she took it off. I wanted to catch the flowers, but I missed them. We danced and had a good time. One of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii, was there. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she is happy.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to navigate it. I like to explore with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me calm and happy. Sometimes I practice my balance with sticks. I like to bring my wooden sword and have fun.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court in our neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. They made me work hard, but I had fun. I hope I can play again soon.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One new bar is expensive, but the service is good. The people in my neighborhood are friendly. They are mostly college students or people who rent apartments because the rent is not high. There is a school near my home. Many children go there. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. Our building manager put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings near me are old. Some have new insides. Down the street, new apartments were built. But they are not good. They are cheaply made. The rent is high. I do not like this. It is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant, there is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk, grass, and the area looks better.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. The city cut down some trees, but it is still a nice place. Behind my building, there are more trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. But the trees hide the bad buildings. There are apartments near me that have crime problems. But I like living here. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. The university is near and I can take the bus easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a closed street. They are placed apart so they look like separate homes. All the houses are yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Many people know each other and are friends. We stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk to each other. Our children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees under a blue sky with white clouds. But sometimes we have to be careful because of storms. Last night we heard tornado sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some things. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of small balls of ice hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road became very hot. The ice melted quickly when it hit the hot ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures of it. It was very nice. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home. They were quiet for a while, then it was normal again. Children played outside while their mothers cooked dinner.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside, but not inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live. It is near the city of Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this good neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I became close to two friends who lived near me. They are not there now, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs.\n\nMy neighborhood has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when the weather is good. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered things online and no one has ever taken my packages.\n\nI trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played ball games with the other kids. I got hurt one time playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe park makes me happy and sad at the same time. The neighborhood is different from most places. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, and Mexican restaurants. You can also get food delivered from apps like GrubHub.\n\nThe stores near my house have everything I need. There are places to clean my clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. You can buy Indian food at an Indian-owned store if you want. I like my neighborhood. I see bad news on the internet about some people who have problems with their neighbors. I am lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special compared to other towns in the state. But it is important for farming. Johnston is famous for peaches. A big sign at the town's entrance says it is the Peach Capital of the World. The town has a lot of land with peach trees and cows. Houses are far apart and are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. They are back a little bit so people can use the front land for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one big light that controls four streets. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town that sells groceries. But people usually go to Walmart in the next town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. The doctor's office and a veterinarian are not in the middle of town. They are small but can help the people of Johnston. We have one elementary school. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We do not have parks, but we are making a new 2.5-acre park. It will be a nice place for families to have fun and for visitors to come. There is not much to do in town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But Johnston is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast. It was about people who went missing. I was surprised. The apartments in my area cost a lot of money - over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this story. My friends also did not know. Maybe this is the problem. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive. But my friends and I have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might start to smoke or get used to things. But second-hand stores always remind us of home. There are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning. But the second-hand stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It is a growing city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. But it is nice to be here. There is music coming from the piano next door and singing from upstairs. It is always something happening. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We are lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to clean my space and leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company too.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. Many people live here. There is a group called a homeowner's association that helps take care of the neighborhood. This group makes sure the homes are neat and nice.\n\nWhen you enter the neighborhood, you see many single-family homes. They are well-maintained because of the homeowner's association. The front yards are similar. There is a small lawn, some decorative rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage.\n\nThe streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any bad holes in the road. Most homes are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. This area is part rural, part suburban. There is a lot of space. We have many community pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself.\n\nThe neighborhood is big. You can run around it and get some exercise. Many people who live here are retired. This is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some younger people also live here.\n\nOur city is not very big, but it feels small. We have many things that we need. There is one big shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many different stores. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to a big shopping area to find what we need.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is an area with low property values. Many people in this area rent or own their homes with low incomes. But it is not an ugly or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other areas. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. A man was shot outside a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by these problems. Sometimes we lose things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nThe town where I live has a big problem. It is called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from taking too much fentanyl. But we have help for people who need it. There are centers to treat addiction and places to learn how to help loved ones.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are kind. My son has special needs, but he is not bullied. Everyone is friendly at the school. They have many events to help families learn and get involved.\n\nThe school is special. It gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child has to go hungry. The town leaders have made improvements to the city. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and not in our area. We wish they would make changes here too.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is located on a hill. Many buildings with history are around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from the theater is a fun bar where people go on warm summer nights. This bar is popular. Many people want to go in. A short walk from my house is a big park. The park is for the whole city. It is surrounded by concrete and stairs. In the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. They are near a place where they can wash and get warm. This is helpful. They can also walk or take public transportation to a family center where they can get food and help.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the history. I like the people. Many years ago, this neighborhood was very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police tried to make it better. The people remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it. The people work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. They say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is true, but I also think it is unfair. I think it is because of the way some people were treated a long time ago. I am not entirely white. I feel safe here. I like the people who live here. They are kind to me. They keep me safe. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are honest and nice. They will give me money if I need it. They say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. There are farms and small towns. There is no big city with many stores. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live in a very beautiful place near the water. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake called Lake Michigan on one side and another lake, Lake Charlevoix, on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to swim at. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not crowded together. They are not the same, old or new. Some houses are old and have been changed. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are many colors of houses in my neighborhood. Most houses have a yard with a trampoline or a playset. Some people have gardens and animal fences. It is like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and you can tell who is from around here and who is not. You can see someone grilling outside and wave at them. If you see someone walking a dog, you can smile at them. The lawns are well taken care of. There are no leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and kept short. If people have plants, they are kept trimmed. This is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks great from outside. It is a quiet and safe place to live. It is a good place to raise a family. Within walking distance, there is a police department and a health office. There is also a place where people take their trash. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers calling the game. We also have a small airport. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the ice cream shop and to the center of town. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is not far away. This is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. It has many people from different countries and cultures. My neighborhood is not very close together. There are homes and businesses mixed together. Some buildings are offices, and others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are many new places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the street. The streets are often close to quiet neighborhoods. There are also parks near my home. I see many people with kids in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very different. One area has many people from the LGBTQ+ community, the Jewish faith, and refugees from Russia. Other parts of the city have people from different countries and cultures. We have areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not very far from where I live. But driving is hard because of traffic. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Many people do not walk, even if places are close. Our city is very big, and people prefer to drive. This makes traffic bad, and parking is hard to find. There has been a lot of building in our city. New apartment buildings are being made. Many people are happy, but others do not want more people and cars. We have many different kinds of homes in our city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, small apartments, and condominiums. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are people of all ages. I do not know many of my neighbors. We are not very close to each other. When I was a child, I played with my neighbor and friends.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. There are many houses. Some houses are for one family. Some houses are divided into two parts, but still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway. It is like many other houses here.\n\nThese houses remind us of a happy time in the past. Many people thought living in the suburbs was the American dream. But now, not as many people think this way. My neighborhood still looks like the American dream. Many people still live here. They still visit here. It makes us think the American dream is still real.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. They think the world is a big place.\n\nThere is a big school near my house. It has been here for almost 90 years. It makes young people think about the future. It makes older people remember the past. There are not many churches in my neighborhood. Most of them are empty. But the basketball courts are always full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people in my neighborhood are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play football here. They stop playing when cars come. Many people have lived in my neighborhood for a long time. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school. But kids stopped going there because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap.\n\nThere is a big highway that goes through our town. But the entrance and exit are in the next town. Some people wanted to build an exit in our town. But older people said it would ruin the town. They talked to the city and they said no.\n\nWe are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good symbol for our town.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People don't usually think there are homes here. But if you go behind the old grocery store, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like a line of connected houses. Some apartments have bad news. We don't want to talk about those. Next to them are other buildings. These are a different world. Most people in the area don't know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. It is not the main school. Students go there to learn. They drink coffee and talk in the morning. People who drive by get angry because they think the students are slowing them down. The street divides into two. There is a park on one side. There is a place where people go to get better after they are hurt. The building has nice furniture. There is a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and play on their skateboards. Old people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers and smile.\n\nThere is a small store where you can buy cheap food. There is a store for swimming pools. There is a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and eat food while you get a manicure. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt. Teenagers like to eat there and play on their skateboards. This is a special place in America. It is a part of history. It is quiet and does not change.",
            "We drove past many fields of corn. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She looked surprised. She was from a city. In her city, she could walk to a store in five minutes. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about my hometown. I grew up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. She finally understood where I came from. We drove down a country road. We came to a big hole in the ground filled with water. Next to it was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their yards. In the spring, there are flowers and trees. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. They shine in the sun.\n\nWe kept driving. My neighbor was outside. He was smiling. He was mowing his lawn. He likes to sing. Everyone laughs at him. He is a kind person. He used to be a doctor. He is older now. He is not as funny as he used to be. He blends in with the grass.\n\nWe came to my house. There are geese in the yard. They run from our dog. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms. There is a small bridge. On the other side, there is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built tree houses. I chased animals. I played with my friends.\n\nWinters are cold here. But they are also beautiful. The trees are empty and brown. The flowers are gone. When it snows, the yard is very pretty. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. We used snowballs as our weapon. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own little world. We didn't think about anything else. We were just kids having fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that is known as \"weird\". There is a sign in the city that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this idea. They think it is a way to remember the Portland of the past, when it was not as well-known and not as expensive. Others think it is a call to come to Portland, where people will say you are weird, but it is a good thing.\n\nPeople come to Portland from other places, like California. They build houses here, but Portland is still weird. \"Weird\" means accepting things that are not normal. We have modern things like computers and cars. But we also have things that are different. We have people who practice yoga, people who are business leaders, and people who like to be creative.\n\nIn my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens. There are free boxes on the street in the summer. These boxes have things that people are giving away. You can find nice clothes, books, and other things in these boxes. Walking through the neighborhood is fun because you never know what you might find.\n\nPortland is a place where people like many things. Some people like to do yoga with goats. Others like to watch the city's soccer team play. We also have people who like to drink beer and socialize. But Portland has problems too. We have a problem with drugs, which is often caused by mental health issues. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. These people come here because we have good services, but our services are not enough.\n\nThe people who live here do not agree on what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. But this is not what makes Portland weird. We are a city with many different kinds of people, and that is what makes us special.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun every morning and every evening. I forget about them sometimes. I am busy with work and life. But they are always there. They do not change. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am very stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw the mountains when I started my college. They are near the campus. The university is beautiful. It has nice buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are special. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes. Students study there for many hours. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and has a nice feeling. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is a mix of busy and quiet. You can find peace and excitement in the same place.\n\nI like this town. It is a good place to make memories. I have happy memories of walking with friends or going to the movies. I also have sad memories. We all have sad times in our lives. The ponds can be a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walk around the town and think about my life. I see the turtles and ducks and insects. They live their lives. I think about my life and try to find my purpose. I walk to a main street. The sun is shining. I see the mountains. They are big and strong. They make me feel strong too. They tell me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It is not hard to find. Many people use public transportation. This is because it is one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurt is an urban area. You will feel like you are in New York City.\n\nYou will see many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people live here. Over 20 years ago, not many Asian people lived in Bensonhurt. But now there are many Asian-owned stores. You will see one store every few blocks. These stores are popular for food, laundry, and other things. People like them because food is good, prices are low, and it is easy.\n\nNear my house, four Asian supermarkets are close together. This makes it easy to buy groceries. But Bensonhurt is not all Asian people. It is also home to people from other countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. It has basketball courts, a big open space, and swings for kids. People can play and be happy here.\n\nMost homes in Bensonhurt are small houses. There are not many big office buildings. But the people here are friendly. They are a little loud. Cars are often driving by with music on. This can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was a victim of mean behavior a long time ago. Recently, people have been stealing packages. And some people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the sidewalk every day. I do not like this.",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. The houses are on a big hill, and the road is very steep. People call this hill the \"exercise hill\" because many people like to run up it every day. There is no sidewalk on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. It has some holes and can be difficult to drive on. The telephone and electricity wires are old and look bad. Sometimes big trees fall on the wires and cause problems. We have a lot of rain and storms, so the wires look like they need repair.\n\nThe neighborhood has many tall green trees. But people do not like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why the houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the water. It's pretty when the sun sets and the water shines. But it often rains and the sun is hidden by clouds. The days are often cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. It even grows on cars and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. Most people are older and have retired. They have dogs, not kids. You often see dogs in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave your door open, they might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room. I had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have wild rabbits. They are big and dig up plants. People do not like them. But my cats like them and have chased most of them away. We have birds too, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chases it away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, so you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. Our street is between two main roads, so there is some traffic. But it is a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move here. I know most of the people who live near me. They take care of their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we slide down a nearby hill on our street. We live on the first corner of our street. We see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. My wife and I have two daughters, ages 11 and 14. We are at home a lot. We like to go outside and play. We also grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. We have a lot of shade, but a lot of leaves fall in the fall. We must rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has come. Recent winters have been mild. It feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. Some families visit from other places on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Many cars are parked on our street. I like living here. If our street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the desert. It is very dry here. You see a lot of dirt and brown things. People know it is hard to take care of a green lawn in this place. When I moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, the houses are still far apart, but more houses have been added. The town is starting to look like a city. Most people in my neighborhood are friendly. Some places are good, and some are not. I like where I live because the people are nice. The stores in my town are almost all chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Many people in my town work in construction. The town is still growing, and there is a lot of space to build. This is a little scary for me. I like my town the way it is. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to the desert for many reasons, like the beauty of the desert. We must learn about the animals that live here to live in peace. My family loves the animals. My kids like catching lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my town. Victorville is a good place for families to visit. You can experience the desert in a new way. If you can, come to our town for our fair. It is a fun event with many activities. Visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski. If you like learning about the desert and its history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American things that tell us about how people lived here.",

It has houses, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses on my campus. There are apartments, houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, 2 to 4 people live together in a room. There are 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Two floors make one building. Usually, 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They are for students and alumni. These houses have 2 to 4 bedrooms. There are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitories. They share a room with one other person.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and ages live here. Teachers and staff live in houses. New students live in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. Now, let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a small town. It has many stores. These stores sell food, clothes, and other things. We can buy everything we need here. There is a park too. It is a public space for everyone. The park is clean and safe because everyone helps take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place. This new place has a good house, a good school, and is not in a bad area.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies in school. I got to know a few of my neighbors. Mr. Glen and his children are nice people. They are like a second family to me. I like them. One day, my family and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI caught a piece of Mr. Glen's wife's leg strap when she took it off. I wanted to catch the flowers, but I missed them. We danced and had a good time. One of Mr. Glen's daughters, Marsharii, was there. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she is happy.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to navigate it. I like to explore with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me calm and happy. Sometimes I practice my balance with sticks. I like to bring my wooden sword and have fun.\n\nWe have a basketball and tennis court in our neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. They made me work hard, but I had fun. I hope I can play again soon.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. These are some of my favorite memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One new bar is expensive, but the service is good. The people in my neighborhood are friendly. They are mostly college students or people who rent apartments because the rent is not high. There is a school near my home. Many children go there. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. Our building manager put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings near me are old. Some have new insides. Down the street, new apartments were built. But they are not good. They are cheaply made. The rent is high. I do not like this. It is not fair.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant, there is a gas station. I have heard it is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk, grass, and the area looks better.\n\nMy apartment building has many trees. The city cut down some trees, but it is still a nice place. Behind my building, there are more trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. But the trees hide the bad buildings. There are apartments near me that have crime problems. But I like living here. I can afford it. There are many useful things near my home. The university is near and I can take the bus easily.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of small houses on a closed street. They are placed apart so they look like separate homes. All the houses are yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Many people know each other and are friends. We stand at the end of our driveways in the evening and talk to each other. Our children play outside with toys, chalk, or kites. It is nice in this world with many machines. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are near fields and trees under a blue sky with white clouds. But sometimes we have to be careful because of storms. Last night we heard tornado sirens. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some things. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of small balls of ice hitting the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road became very hot. The ice melted quickly when it hit the hot ground. The sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took pictures of it. It was very nice. The neighborhood was quiet for a while. Then people came home. They were quiet for a while, then it was normal again. Children played outside while their mothers cooked dinner.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is friendly. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside, but not inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live. It is near the city of Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this good neighborhood.",
            "I moved to my new neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I became close to two friends who lived near me. They are not there now, but I still have good memories. The people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs.\n\nMy neighborhood has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when the weather is good. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered things online and no one has ever taken my packages.\n\nI trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played ball games with the other kids. I got hurt one time playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like to play on swings and slides.\n\nThe park makes me happy and sad at the same time. The neighborhood is different from most places. You can find many kinds of food near my house. There are Chinese, Indian, and Mexican restaurants. You can also get food delivered from apps like GrubHub.\n\nThe stores near my house have everything I need. There are places to clean my clothes, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. You can buy Indian food at an Indian-owned store if you want. I like my neighborhood. I see bad news on the internet about some people who have problems with their neighbors. I am lucky to have good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special compared to other towns in the state. But it is important for farming. Johnston is famous for peaches. A big sign at the town's entrance says it is the Peach Capital of the World. The town has a lot of land with peach trees and cows. Houses are far apart and are usually two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. They are back a little bit so people can use the front land for animals or crops. In the middle of town, there is one big light that controls four streets. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town that sells groceries. But people usually go to Walmart in the next town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. The doctor's office and a veterinarian are not in the middle of town. They are small but can help the people of Johnston. We have one elementary school. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We do not have parks, but we are making a new 2.5-acre park. It will be a nice place for families to have fun and for visitors to come. There is not much to do in town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But Johnston is a nice town.",
            "I first heard about my neighborhood on a podcast. It was about people who went missing. I was surprised. The apartments in my area cost a lot of money - over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard about this story. My friends also did not know. Maybe this is the problem. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive. But my friends and I have learned to be careful with money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. As we grow up, we smell less. We might start to smoke or get used to things. But second-hand stores always remind us of home. There are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The city is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning. But the second-hand stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come here. It is a growing city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. But it is nice to be here. There is music coming from the piano next door and singing from upstairs. It is always something happening. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We are lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are kind to me. I try to clean my space and leave them food. They do the same for me. We bring mail to each other. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company too.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. Many people live here. There is a group called a homeowner's association that helps take care of the neighborhood. This group makes sure the homes are neat and nice.\n\nWhen you enter the neighborhood, you see many single-family homes. They are well-maintained because of the homeowner's association. The front yards are similar. There is a small lawn, some decorative rocks, and a short driveway. Some houses have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage.\n\nThe streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any bad holes in the road. Most homes are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail.\n\nMy house is near the edge of the city. This area is part rural, part suburban. There is a lot of space. We have many community pools that anyone can use. They are clean and safe. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk by yourself.\n\nThe neighborhood is big. You can run around it and get some exercise. Many people who live here are retired. This is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some younger people also live here.\n\nOur city is not very big, but it feels small. We have many things that we need. There is one big shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to a place that is important. When you get there, you can find many different stores. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to a big shopping area to find what we need.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is an area with low property values. Many people in this area rent or own their homes with low incomes. But it is not an ugly or unpleasant place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nCrime rates are a little higher here than in other areas. There have been some violent crimes near my home in the past ten years. A man was shot outside a bar. Luckily, we have not been affected by these problems. Sometimes we lose things from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nThe town where I live has a big problem. It is called the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from taking too much fentanyl. But we have help for people who need it. There are centers to treat addiction and places to learn how to help loved ones.\n\nDespite the problems, my town has good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are kind. My son has special needs, but he is not bullied. Everyone is friendly at the school. They have many events to help families learn and get involved.\n\nThe school is special. It gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child has to go hungry. The town leaders have made improvements to the city. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and not in our area. We wish they would make changes here too.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is located on a hill. Many buildings with history are around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street from the theater is a fun bar where people go on warm summer nights. This bar is popular. Many people want to go in. A short walk from my house is a big park. The park is for the whole city. It is surrounded by concrete and stairs. In the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents on the sidewalk and stairs. They are near a place where they can wash and get warm. This is helpful. They can also walk or take public transportation to a family center where they can get food and help.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I do not like the old buildings and the history. I like the people. Many years ago, this neighborhood was very bad. There was a lot of violence. The government and police tried to make it better. The people remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it. The people work hard to make their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. They say that if you are white, you should not walk here at night. I think this is true, but I also think it is unfair. I think it is because of the way some people were treated a long time ago. I am not entirely white. I feel safe here. I like the people who live here. They are kind to me. They keep me safe. I like walking at night and meeting people. They are honest and nice. They will give me money if I need it. They say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in the countryside. There are farms and small towns. There is no big city with many stores. If I need something, I must drive to get it. But I live in a very beautiful place near the water. My town is surrounded by water. There is a big lake called Lake Michigan on one side and another lake, Lake Charlevoix, on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to swim at. My neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not crowded together. They are not the same, old or new. Some houses are old and have been changed. Most houses have a basement that you can see from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are many colors of houses in my neighborhood. Most houses have a yard with a trampoline or a playset. Some people have gardens and animal fences. It is like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise families. You can see kids playing outside on any day. You can also see people walking dogs or riding bikes. Neighbors know each other and you can tell who is from around here and who is not. You can see someone grilling outside and wave at them. If you see someone walking a dog, you can smile at them. The lawns are well taken care of. There are no leaves on the ground in the fall. The grass is cut and kept short. If people have plants, they are kept trimmed. This is not a beautiful neighborhood that looks great from outside. It is a quiet and safe place to live. It is a good place to raise a family. Within walking distance, there is a police department and a health office. There is also a place where people take their trash. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers calling the game. We also have a small airport. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the ice cream shop and to the center of town. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is not far away. This is a great place to live."
