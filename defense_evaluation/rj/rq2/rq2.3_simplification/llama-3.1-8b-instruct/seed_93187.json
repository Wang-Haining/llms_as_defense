            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts, connected together. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the side. It looks like the suburbs of America a long time ago. That time was the American dream. Many people wanted to live like this. But now the dream is not as strong. My neighborhood reminds people that the dream is still alive. People visit my neighborhood and see that the dream is still real. The people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway.

            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People do not usually think of it as a place to live. But if you go behind an old building and walk down the road, you will see a busy community. There are many apartments here. They are next to each other, like boxes in a line.\n\nSome of the apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about those. The other apartments are a different story. Almost no one knows about them. Across from the apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They wake up early in the morning and go to class with coffee in their hands. The gates open slowly to let them in. Cars drive by quickly, and people shake their fists at the students for slowing them down.\n\nThe road splits into two. There is a park on one side and a building where people go to get better after breaking a bone. The building has nice furniture on the porch. There is a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people skateboarding. The young people laugh and talk about their friends.\n\nThere is a place to eat sushi and a store that sells swimming things. There is also a place to get a manicure and a swimming pool. You can get food, a manicure, and fill your pool all at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt.

I could see it in her eyes. She finally understood where I was from.\n\nWe drove down a small country road. There was a big water-filled hole on one side. Just after that was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They each have a big piece of land.

Everyone likes him, but he is also a very interesting person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and not as funny. He still has a special face.\n\nWe arrived at my house.

There were always friends to play with.\n\nIn the winter, it is very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees that were green are now bare. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I used to make snowmen and snow angels. We had a lot of fun.

            "Portland, Oregon is a strange city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place where people are free to be different. Some people like this because it reminds them of Portland in the 1990s and early 2000s. That Portland was a smaller city with lower costs. It had many creative and unique cultures. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a call to come to the city. Here, people will still think you are strange, but it is a compliment.\n\nMany people from California are moving to Portland. This is changing the city. New homes are being built for them. But Portland is still strange. Strange does not mean the city does not have modern things. We buy many things from China like the rest of the country. We have normal things too. We have yoga, hipster shops, and business people.\n\nPerhaps being weird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens with flowers and food. In the summer, we have free boxes. These are boxes with things that people are giving away. You can find good things in these boxes. They can have clothes, books, or anything.\n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland can be magical. This is what Portland is about to me. But I am only one of many people who like Portland. Some people I live with would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to yoga with goats or watch the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is full of people who like different things. Some people are trying to achieve their dreams. Others are drinking too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. This problem often comes from mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies also contribute to the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. The city's services are not enough to help everyone. People who are not homeless are divided. Some people care about the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not unique to Portland.",

The town is busy, but it is not too busy.\n\nI can escape the city by going to the library. It is a small town with a quiet atmosphere. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It makes me feel calm, but it also makes me think about my life. I have good memories and bad memories here. I like walking in the park with my friends. I like going to the movies in the city. I also have sad times here. I like to walk by the pond and think about my life. I see turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want to do.\n\nI walk by the pond and the park and the houses. I reach the main street. The sun shines brightly. I see the mountains in the north. They are strong and high. They make me feel like I can do anything. They make me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is very good. Bensonhurst is a part of New York City, so you will still feel like you are in the city. When you visit, you will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. Because of this, you see an Asian-owned store on almost every street. These stores are often supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to shop. I live near four Asian supermarkets. They are all close to each other, within two minutes of walking. This is very convenient for buying groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a diverse neighborhood with many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses in the neighborhood are owned by Asian people. There is also a park near where I live. It has many things for people to do, like basketball courts, a soccer field, and swings for kids. People of all kinds play together in the park.\n\nThere are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most of the buildings are for people who live in apartments or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this neighborhood are generally nice. However, it can be noisy. Cars often drive by with loud music. People also drive quickly and loudly. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I had a bad experience in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But many people do not do this in Bensonhurst. You often see dog waste on the street. My big complaint is the dog waste. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "In the place where I live, there are not many sidewalks. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many runners go there to exercise every day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is rough and not very safe to drive on in some places.\n\nMany telephone and electric wires are above the street. They look old and damaged because strong winds often knock them down. People fix them often, but they still look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. However, people don't like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nThe weather is often cloudy. Most days are overcast and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. I had to spend three hours cleaning it. There are not many children in my area. Most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. Dogs are common in the neighborhood. You often see them in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it outside.\n\nWild rabbits live in the area. They are big and like to dig in gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We have a few stores near the water, but if you walk downhill, you can find more restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but casting stones into the water is fun. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is in a quiet neighborhood. It is between two big roads, so we see some traffic. Most people do their work in their yards and daily tasks. I know most of my neighbors. They like to walk and exercise their dogs. Children ride their bicycles. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife and I, and our two daughters, ten and fourteen years old. This means we see our neighbors often.\n\nWe like to play outside. We even play in the rain. We sometimes grill food on our back porch. It smells good. Many people cut their grass. We hear a lot of lawn mowers from March to October.\n\nOur neighborhood is surrounded by trees. This means it is cool and shady. But in the fall, we have a lot of leaves. We must clean them up. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe do not have much winter. It seems like fall is very long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work in the garage on my truck and other projects. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to my neighbors.\n\nOn holidays, it is quiet. Some families visit from other places on Thanksgiving and other special days. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. The only thing I do not like is that our street is a through street.",
            "My home is in a dry desert area. It is very hot. The ground is brown. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it means the owner works very hard to keep it green. I have lived here since the 1990s. The houses were far apart. Now, more people have moved in. The area looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. The people here are friendly. But, like in any city, some people are nice and some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are friendly. The stores here are like big chain stores. They sell food and other things. There are no special stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy food from a special store, you must travel far. The main jobs here are in construction. Many people build houses and buildings. This is because the area is not fully developed. It has many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install walls and bars. One good thing about my home is the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many types of animals and plants. It is hard to protect the desert, but we must. We must learn about the animals that live here. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some good places to visit. Victorville is a good place for families. You can see the desert and do fun things. If you come, visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum is interesting. It has rocks and old bones from the desert. It also has things from Native American people and old objects that tell us about the history of Victorville. If you like the desert and its history, visit the museum.",
            "I live in a college campus. This is my neighborhood. I live in a dormitory with many people. The people who live in my dorm are my community. I also think of the campus and buildings around my dorm as my neighborhood. \n\nMy neighborhood has many things like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses. \n\nFirst, there are apartments. Two to four people live in each room. Each floor has four to six rooms. So, 20 people live in each building. \n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. They have two to four bedrooms. Alumni usually live in these houses. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. Two people usually share a room. This is the most common kind of housing in my neighborhood. \n\nLet's talk about the people. My school likes diversity. The neighborhood has people from many countries and ages. Staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Old students live in apartments. \n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores sell food, school clothes, and groceries. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. At first, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. I missed my old home. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. We have a new, safer home now. We also have a better high school. I made some new friends and some new enemies in school. I knew a few neighbors very well. Mr. Glen and his family are nice. They live next door to us. I like them. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a piece of his wife's shoe when she took it off! I also danced a lot. A girl from Mr. Glen's family, Marsharii, is a friend. I don't see her now.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I like to walk in the park. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I have a wooden sword and like to play with it. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time.\n\nI have many happy memories here. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. They are students or low-income people. They live here because the rent is not high. There is an elementary school close to my home. Many children live here. I don't know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My apartment building put a special air cleaner near their door. It makes the air smell good. I think it's funny.\n\nThe buildings near me are old. But they may have new inside. There are new apartments down the street. But I don't like them. They are not well built. The rent is high. I think it's not fair. Many people live in these buildings because they are near the campus. Across the street from my home is a cheap restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near the restaurant. I heard it's a bad place to work. The city gave money to fix the road near my home. Now the sidewalk is wide and there is grass on the side of the road. The area is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down. But I like the trees near my home.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad. The buildings look old and dirty. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. Most crimes happen at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I don't blame them alone. There are other apartments on my street that have problems. There are many trees on my street. I like living here. It's affordable. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses. They look like separate houses because they are far apart. Each house is yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. People here are friendly. They like to talk to each other. On some evenings, we stand in our driveways and visit. Our children play outside with toys and chalk. We enjoy this. It is a good feeling in a world with many machines. It feels like the past.\n\nOur neighborhood has fields, trees, and blue skies. We see white clouds. This is nice. But sometimes we have bad weather. We had a big storm. We heard a warning and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The storm was loud. We heard hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. We saw a rainbow. I took pictures.\n\nThe streets were quiet after the storm. People finally came home. We had dinner together. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. Our apartments are the same on the outside, but different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer. In the morning, I hear a frog singing. It is a good place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters singing. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard at first. I became friends with two people who lived nearby. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. The same people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American neighborhoods. There are many houses with two floors. I often hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. If you need help, people will help you. I have ordered packages online many times without any problems. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad because it reminds me of good times. My neighborhood is very different from others because it has many types of food. We have Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near us. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and many pizza shops. You can find everything you need at the stores. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store on the same street. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am thankful for my good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town signs say. \n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. They are not near the road. They are in the fields. \n\nIn the town, there is one traffic light. This is where people buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for Cherry Coca-Cola. \n\nThere is one small grocery store called IGA. People go there to buy a few things. Most people go to a bigger store in a nearby town to buy their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. It is always busy. There is a small furniture store. The woman who runs it is kind. She has two men to help deliver the furniture. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets. They cut their hair and take care of them. \n\nThere is a small school for little kids. When they grow up, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. It will have a place for kids to play and people to walk their dogs. The town is small. People can walk by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast about people who disappeared. This surprised me. Many apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I never heard of this story and neither did my friends. We are struggling. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we learned to save money. We like old toys and old clothes. We smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke or get used to things. The flea market is always there. It smells like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean the piano.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The area is crowded, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore people and cars come here every year. It's a growing city. A big company that sells things online is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet. You can keep your private life. The city is lively. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a good community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind and I like them. We help each other.\n\nI live in a big apartment building, but my neighbors make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is very clean and nice. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep it that way. The houses are all the same. They are single family homes with small yards. The yards have grass and small stones. There is a short driveway. Everyone has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. You will not see holes in the road.\n\nMost houses are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have a special box for mail in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. My neighborhood is like a mix of a small town and the country. We have a lot of space. We have several swimming pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. We also have paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things that people usually need, like a big store with many things inside. It takes 15 minutes to drive to anywhere important. When you get there, you can find many stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and paths. We are not close to big shopping, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area has low property values. Many people live here because they cannot afford to live in other parts of town. They rent or own small houses. My neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. However, it is still not bad. There have been a few violent crimes near my home. These include some shootings and one murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Fortunately, we have not had any big problems with crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we leave them outside. A big problem in our town is the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. We have places to help people with addiction. These include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends. Despite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son is happy there. The school takes care of children with special needs. He has no problems at school. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. We do not have to worry about our son going hungry. The city is making our town better. They have fixed roads and parks. However, they have done more work on the other side of town. Our side needs more help. This is a problem for us. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores for our needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a big apartment building. It is across from an old theater. There is a fun bar a short walk away. People like to go there on warm summer nights. \n\nWhen it is cold, people who do not have homes sleep near the city park. The park is big. It has concrete and stairs around it. People can walk to the park from my building. They can also walk to a place where they can bathe and get warm.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the people. It used to be a bad place. Many years ago, there was a lot of violence. The government tried to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. I think this is like the past. It makes me think about racism and unfair ideas. I like my neighborhood because the people are kind. They help each other. I have walked the streets at night and met many people. They have helped me when I needed it. I feel happy in my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a place where you can see a lot of farmland and small cities. There are no big stores like Walmart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. I live near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. The water is very beautiful. My town is also surrounded by water. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to play in.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not very close to each other. They are older homes, some new and some old. Many houses have basements that you can see from the road. Some houses have aluminum siding and some have different colors. Most houses have yards with toys and gardens. People take care of their lawns and keep them clean.\n\nPeople in this town work hard to make a living. They are good people who raise their families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. Neighbors know each other and are friendly. If you see someone grilling or walking their dog, you can wave and say hello. The lawns are neat and clean. You can tell it is a safe place to live.\n\nThere is a police station and a jail near my house. We also have a place to recycle and a baseball field where you can hear the announcers. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying overhead. Our ice cream shop is close by too. You can walk to the park and ride your bike to the ice cream store. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. There are houses and offices near each other. Some buildings are office buildings, some are stores, and some are restaurants. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small shops. These small shops are popular. They are in shopping malls and on streets. The streets are near neighborhoods that are quiet and nice. There are parks near my neighborhood. Many people go to these parks with their small children. My neighborhood is very diverse.

The city is very big, and traffic is bad. It is hard to find parking spaces. Recently, the city has been building many new apartment buildings. This makes some people happy, but others are not. They do not want more people and more cars. There are many kinds of houses in my city. People live in big apartment buildings, small houses, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of houses. People of all ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. The neighborhood is not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts, connected together. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the side. It looks like the suburbs of America a long time ago. That time was the American dream. Many people wanted to live like this. But now the dream is not as strong. My neighborhood reminds people that the dream is still alive. People visit my neighborhood and see that the dream is still real. The people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside like the world is their own. The local school has been here for almost 90 years. It still shows children their future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing when cars come. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But children stopped going because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. The younger people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one highway that passes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next door. We used to want to have our own entrance and exit. The younger people wanted it, but the older people said no. They said it would ruin our town. Now they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People do not usually think of it as a place to live. But if you go behind an old building and walk down the road, you will see a busy community. There are many apartments here. They are next to each other, like boxes in a line.\n\nSome of the apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about those. The other apartments are a different story. Almost no one knows about them. Across from the apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They wake up early in the morning and go to class with coffee in their hands. The gates open slowly to let them in. Cars drive by quickly, and people shake their fists at the students for slowing them down.\n\nThe road splits into two. There is a park on one side and a building where people go to get better after breaking a bone. The building has nice furniture on the porch. There is a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people skateboarding. The young people laugh and talk about their friends.\n\nThere is a place to eat sushi and a store that sells swimming things. There is also a place to get a manicure and a swimming pool. You can get food, a manicure, and fill your pool all at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt. Young people like to eat there while they skateboard and use a special device to breathe in the air.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet area where not much changes.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is my home,\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the big open space. She came from a town where a grocery store was near her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. I could see it in her eyes. She finally understood where I was from.\n\nWe drove down a small country road. There was a big water-filled hole on one side. Just after that was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They each have a big piece of land. Everyone takes care of their land.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers are planted and trees with different colors change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine after being washed.\n\nAs we drove, I pointed to my house. My neighbor was outside. He is a kind Korean man. He spends the day mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him, but he is also a very interesting person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and not as funny. He still has a special face.\n\nWe arrived at my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind the house, there is a stream that feeds into the water hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes animals from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge, there is a special place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That is where I grew up. I built forts in the trees and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nIn the winter, it is very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees that were green are now bare. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I used to make snowmen and snow angels. We had a lot of fun. We even made forts to fight with snowballs.\n\nThis was a special place for us to play. We didn't worry about anything. We were just two happy kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a strange city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place where people are free to be different. Some people like this because it reminds them of Portland in the 1990s and early 2000s. That Portland was a smaller city with lower costs. It had many creative and unique cultures. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a call to come to the city. Here, people will still think you are strange, but it is a compliment.\n\nMany people from California are moving to Portland. This is changing the city. New homes are being built for them. But Portland is still strange. Strange does not mean the city does not have modern things. We buy many things from China like the rest of the country. We have normal things too. We have yoga, hipster shops, and business people.\n\nPerhaps being weird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens with flowers and food. In the summer, we have free boxes. These are boxes with things that people are giving away. You can find good things in these boxes. They can have clothes, books, or anything.\n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland can be magical. This is what Portland is about to me. But I am only one of many people who like Portland. Some people I live with would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to yoga with goats or watch the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is full of people who like different things. Some people are trying to achieve their dreams. Others are drinking too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. This problem often comes from mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies also contribute to the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. The city's services are not enough to help everyone. People who are not homeless are divided. Some people care about the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not unique to Portland.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They do not mind what people do. They are strong and steady. When I am stressed and sad, the mountains help me. They make me feel better. They give me the strength to go on.\n\nI moved to this town when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing I saw and liked. The university has nice buildings and a pond and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied for a long time. I can walk or take the bus to the city center. It is old and has a lot of history. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is busy, but it is not too busy.\n\nI can escape the city by going to the library. It is a small town with a quiet atmosphere. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It makes me feel calm, but it also makes me think about my life. I have good memories and bad memories here. I like walking in the park with my friends. I like going to the movies in the city. I also have sad times here. I like to walk by the pond and think about my life. I see turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want to do.\n\nI walk by the pond and the park and the houses. I reach the main street. The sun shines brightly. I see the mountains in the north. They are strong and high. They make me feel like I can do anything. They make me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is very good. Bensonhurst is a part of New York City, so you will still feel like you are in the city. When you visit, you will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. Because of this, you see an Asian-owned store on almost every street. These stores are often supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to shop. I live near four Asian supermarkets. They are all close to each other, within two minutes of walking. This is very convenient for buying groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a diverse neighborhood with many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses in the neighborhood are owned by Asian people. There is also a park near where I live. It has many things for people to do, like basketball courts, a soccer field, and swings for kids. People of all kinds play together in the park.\n\nThere are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most of the buildings are for people who live in apartments or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this neighborhood are generally nice. However, it can be noisy. Cars often drive by with loud music. People also drive quickly and loudly. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I had a bad experience in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But many people do not do this in Bensonhurst. You often see dog waste on the street. My big complaint is the dog waste. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "In the place where I live, there are not many sidewalks. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many runners go there to exercise every day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is rough and not very safe to drive on in some places.\n\nMany telephone and electric wires are above the street. They look old and damaged because strong winds often knock them down. People fix them often, but they still look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. However, people don't like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nThe weather is often cloudy. Most days are overcast and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. I had to spend three hours cleaning it. There are not many children in my area. Most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. Dogs are common in the neighborhood. You often see them in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it outside.\n\nWild rabbits live in the area. They are big and like to dig in gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We have a few stores near the water, but if you walk downhill, you can find more restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but casting stones into the water is fun. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is in a quiet neighborhood. It is between two big roads, so we see some traffic. Most people do their work in their yards and daily tasks. I know most of my neighbors. They like to walk and exercise their dogs. Children ride their bicycles. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife and I, and our two daughters, ten and fourteen years old. This means we see our neighbors often.\n\nWe like to play outside. We even play in the rain. We sometimes grill food on our back porch. It smells good. Many people cut their grass. We hear a lot of lawn mowers from March to October.\n\nOur neighborhood is surrounded by trees. This means it is cool and shady. But in the fall, we have a lot of leaves. We must clean them up. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe do not have much winter. It seems like fall is very long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work in the garage on my truck and other projects. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to my neighbors.\n\nOn holidays, it is quiet. Some families visit from other places on Thanksgiving and other special days. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. The only thing I do not like is that our street is a through street.",
            "My home is in a dry desert area. It is very hot. The ground is brown. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it means the owner works very hard to keep it green. I have lived here since the 1990s. The houses were far apart. Now, more people have moved in. The area looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. The people here are friendly. But, like in any city, some people are nice and some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are friendly. The stores here are like big chain stores. They sell food and other things. There are no special stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy food from a special store, you must travel far. The main jobs here are in construction. Many people build houses and buildings. This is because the area is not fully developed. It has many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install walls and bars. One good thing about my home is the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many types of animals and plants. It is hard to protect the desert, but we must. We must learn about the animals that live here. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some good places to visit. Victorville is a good place for families. You can see the desert and do fun things. If you come, visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum is interesting. It has rocks and old bones from the desert. It also has things from Native American people and old objects that tell us about the history of Victorville. If you like the desert and its history, visit the museum.",
            "I live in a college campus. This is my neighborhood. I live in a dormitory with many people. The people who live in my dorm are my community. I also think of the campus and buildings around my dorm as my neighborhood. \n\nMy neighborhood has many things like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses. \n\nFirst, there are apartments. Two to four people live in each room. Each floor has four to six rooms. So, 20 people live in each building. \n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. They have two to four bedrooms. Alumni usually live in these houses. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. Two people usually share a room. This is the most common kind of housing in my neighborhood. \n\nLet's talk about the people. My school likes diversity. The neighborhood has people from many countries and ages. Staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Old students live in apartments. \n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores sell food, school clothes, and groceries. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. At first, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. I missed my old home. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. We have a new, safer home now. We also have a better high school. I made some new friends and some new enemies in school. I knew a few neighbors very well. Mr. Glen and his family are nice. They live next door to us. I like them. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a piece of his wife's shoe when she took it off! I also danced a lot. A girl from Mr. Glen's family, Marsharii, is a friend. I don't see her now.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I like to walk in the park. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I have a wooden sword and like to play with it. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time.\n\nI have many happy memories here. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. They are students or low-income people. They live here because the rent is not high. There is an elementary school close to my home. Many children live here. I don't know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My apartment building put a special air cleaner near their door. It makes the air smell good. I think it's funny.\n\nThe buildings near me are old. But they may have new inside. There are new apartments down the street. But I don't like them. They are not well built. The rent is high. I think it's not fair. Many people live in these buildings because they are near the campus. Across the street from my home is a cheap restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near the restaurant. I heard it's a bad place to work. The city gave money to fix the road near my home. Now the sidewalk is wide and there is grass on the side of the road. The area is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down. But I like the trees near my home.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad. The buildings look old and dirty. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. Most crimes happen at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I don't blame them alone. There are other apartments on my street that have problems. There are many trees on my street. I like living here. It's affordable. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses. They look like separate houses because they are far apart. Each house is yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. People here are friendly. They like to talk to each other. On some evenings, we stand in our driveways and visit. Our children play outside with toys and chalk. We enjoy this. It is a good feeling in a world with many machines. It feels like the past.\n\nOur neighborhood has fields, trees, and blue skies. We see white clouds. This is nice. But sometimes we have bad weather. We had a big storm. We heard a warning and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The storm was loud. We heard hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. We saw a rainbow. I took pictures.\n\nThe streets were quiet after the storm. People finally came home. We had dinner together. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. Our apartments are the same on the outside, but different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer. In the morning, I hear a frog singing. It is a good place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters singing. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard at first. I became friends with two people who lived nearby. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. The same people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American neighborhoods. There are many houses with two floors. I often hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. If you need help, people will help you. I have ordered packages online many times without any problems. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad because it reminds me of good times. My neighborhood is very different from others because it has many types of food. We have Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near us. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and many pizza shops. You can find everything you need at the stores. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store on the same street. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am thankful for my good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town signs say. \n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. They are not near the road. They are in the fields. \n\nIn the town, there is one traffic light. This is where people buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for Cherry Coca-Cola. \n\nThere is one small grocery store called IGA. People go there to buy a few things. Most people go to a bigger store in a nearby town to buy their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. It is always busy. There is a small furniture store. The woman who runs it is kind. She has two men to help deliver the furniture. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets. They cut their hair and take care of them. \n\nThere is a small school for little kids. When they grow up, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. It will have a place for kids to play and people to walk their dogs. The town is small. People can walk by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast about people who disappeared. This surprised me. Many apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I never heard of this story and neither did my friends. We are struggling. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we learned to save money. We like old toys and old clothes. We smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke or get used to things. The flea market is always there. It smells like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean the piano.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The area is crowded, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore people and cars come here every year. It's a growing city. A big company that sells things online is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet. You can keep your private life. The city is lively. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a good community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind and I like them. We help each other.\n\nI live in a big apartment building, but my neighbors make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is very clean and nice. A group called the homeowner's association helps keep it that way. The houses are all the same. They are single family homes with small yards. The yards have grass and small stones. There is a short driveway. Everyone has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. You will not see holes in the road.\n\nMost houses are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have a special box for mail in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. My neighborhood is like a mix of a small town and the country. We have a lot of space. We have several swimming pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. We also have paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things that people usually need, like a big store with many things inside. It takes 15 minutes to drive to anywhere important. When you get there, you can find many stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and paths. We are not close to big shopping, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area has low property values. Many people live here because they cannot afford to live in other parts of town. They rent or own small houses. My neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. However, it is still not bad. There have been a few violent crimes near my home. These include some shootings and one murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Fortunately, we have not had any big problems with crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we leave them outside. A big problem in our town is the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. We have places to help people with addiction. These include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends. Despite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son is happy there. The school takes care of children with special needs. He has no problems at school. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. We do not have to worry about our son going hungry. The city is making our town better. They have fixed roads and parks. However, they have done more work on the other side of town. Our side needs more help. This is a problem for us. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores for our needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a big apartment building. It is across from an old theater. There is a fun bar a short walk away. People like to go there on warm summer nights. \n\nWhen it is cold, people who do not have homes sleep near the city park. The park is big. It has concrete and stairs around it. People can walk to the park from my building. They can also walk to a place where they can bathe and get warm.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the people. It used to be a bad place. Many years ago, there was a lot of violence. The government tried to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. I think this is like the past. It makes me think about racism and unfair ideas. I like my neighborhood because the people are kind. They help each other. I have walked the streets at night and met many people. They have helped me when I needed it. I feel happy in my neighborhood.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan, USA. It is a place where you can see a lot of farmland and small cities. There are no big stores like Walmart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. I live near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. The water is very beautiful. My town is also surrounded by water. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to play in.\n\nMy neighborhood is a small town. The houses are not very close to each other. They are older homes, some new and some old. Many houses have basements that you can see from the road. Some houses have aluminum siding and some have different colors. Most houses have yards with toys and gardens. People take care of their lawns and keep them clean.\n\nPeople in this town work hard to make a living. They are good people who raise their families. You can see kids playing outside and people walking their dogs. Neighbors know each other and are friendly. If you see someone grilling or walking their dog, you can wave and say hello. The lawns are neat and clean. You can tell it is a safe place to live.\n\nThere is a police station and a jail near my house. We also have a place to recycle and a baseball field where you can hear the announcers. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying overhead. Our ice cream shop is close by too. You can walk to the park and ride your bike to the ice cream store. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

But the drive can be long because of traffic. It can take a long time to drive a short distance. Many people in my city do not walk. They prefer to drive or take a car. The city is very big, and traffic is bad. It is hard to find parking spaces. Recently, the city has been building many new apartment buildings. This makes some people happy, but others are not. They do not want more people and more cars. There are many kinds of houses in my city. People live in big apartment buildings, small houses, and condominiums. Some houses are for one family, and some are for two families. My neighborhood is the same. There are many different kinds of houses. People of all ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. The neighborhood is not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses are divided into two parts, connected together. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the side. It looks like the suburbs of America a long time ago. That time was the American dream. Many people wanted to live like this. But now the dream is not as strong. My neighborhood reminds people that the dream is still alive. People visit my neighborhood and see that the dream is still real. The people in my neighborhood are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as well as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside like the world is their own. The local school has been here for almost 90 years. It still shows children their future. It also makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. They stop playing when cars come. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school. But children stopped going because they did not want to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. The younger people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one highway that passes through my town. But the entrance and exit are in the town next door. We used to want to have our own entrance and exit. The younger people wanted it, but the older people said no. They said it would ruin our town. Now they are building a new school. We are trying to choose a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is behind a shopping area. People do not usually think of it as a place to live. But if you go behind an old building and walk down the road, you will see a busy community. There are many apartments here. They are next to each other, like boxes in a line.\n\nSome of the apartments have had problems in the past. We will not talk about those. The other apartments are a different story. Almost no one knows about them. Across from the apartments is a small college. Students go there to learn. They wake up early in the morning and go to class with coffee in their hands. The gates open slowly to let them in. Cars drive by quickly, and people shake their fists at the students for slowing them down.\n\nThe road splits into two. There is a park on one side and a building where people go to get better after breaking a bone. The building has nice furniture on the porch. There is a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park. They run and jump in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people skateboarding. The young people laugh and talk about their friends.\n\nThere is a place to eat sushi and a store that sells swimming things. There is also a place to get a manicure and a swimming pool. You can get food, a manicure, and fill your pool all at the same time. There is also a place that sells frozen yogurt. Young people like to eat there while they skateboard and use a special device to breathe in the air.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place in America. It is a part of history in a quiet area where not much changes.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is my home,\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the big open space. She came from a town where a grocery store was near her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She was surprised. I could see it in her eyes. She finally understood where I was from.\n\nWe drove down a small country road. There was a big water-filled hole on one side. Just after that was the place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. They each have a big piece of land. Everyone takes care of their land.\n\nIn the spring, many flowers are planted and trees with different colors change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine after being washed.\n\nAs we drove, I pointed to my house. My neighbor was outside. He is a kind Korean man. He spends the day mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him, but he is also a very interesting person. He used to be a doctor. Now he is older and not as funny. He still has a special face.\n\nWe arrived at my house. There are many geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind the house, there is a stream that feeds into the water hole. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes animals from the nearby farms. Across a small bridge, there is a special place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That is where I grew up. I built forts in the trees and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nIn the winter, it is very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees that were green are now bare. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I used to make snowmen and snow angels. We had a lot of fun. We even made forts to fight with snowballs.\n\nThis was a special place for us to play. We didn't worry about anything. We were just two happy kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a strange city. The city's unofficial saying is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This means Portland is a place where people are free to be different. Some people like this because it reminds them of Portland in the 1990s and early 2000s. That Portland was a smaller city with lower costs. It had many creative and unique cultures. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" is a call to come to the city. Here, people will still think you are strange, but it is a compliment.\n\nMany people from California are moving to Portland. This is changing the city. New homes are being built for them. But Portland is still strange. Strange does not mean the city does not have modern things. We buy many things from China like the rest of the country. We have normal things too. We have yoga, hipster shops, and business people.\n\nPerhaps being weird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, we have colorful houses and gardens with flowers and food. In the summer, we have free boxes. These are boxes with things that people are giving away. You can find good things in these boxes. They can have clothes, books, or anything.\n\nWalking through a neighborhood in Portland can be magical. This is what Portland is about to me. But I am only one of many people who like Portland. Some people I live with would never take things from a box on the sidewalk. They go to yoga with goats or watch the city's soccer team.\n\nPortland is full of people who like different things. Some people are trying to achieve their dreams. Others are drinking too much at the bar. Yes, Portland has a problem with drugs. This problem often comes from mental health issues. The rainy weather and gray skies also contribute to the problem. Portland also has a problem with homelessness. The city's services are not enough to help everyone. People who are not homeless are divided. Some people care about the homeless. Others do not like them. This is not unique to Portland.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set every day. They do not change. They do not mind what people do. They are strong and steady. When I am stressed and sad, the mountains help me. They make me feel better. They give me the strength to go on.\n\nI moved to this town when I started college. The mountains near the campus are beautiful. They are the first thing I saw and liked. The university has nice buildings and a pond and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied for a long time. I can walk or take the bus to the city center. It is old and has a lot of history. The buildings are old and colorful. The town is busy, but it is not too busy.\n\nI can escape the city by going to the library. It is a small town with a quiet atmosphere. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It makes me feel calm, but it also makes me think about my life. I have good memories and bad memories here. I like walking in the park with my friends. I like going to the movies in the city. I also have sad times here. I like to walk by the pond and think about my life. I see turtles and ducks and insects living their lives. I think about my own life and what I want to do.\n\nI walk by the pond and the park and the houses. I reach the main street. The sun shines brightly. I see the mountains in the north. They are strong and high. They make me feel like I can do anything. They make me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is very good. Bensonhurst is a part of New York City, so you will still feel like you are in the city. When you visit, you will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. Because of this, you see an Asian-owned store on almost every street. These stores are often supermarkets and laundromats. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is easy to shop. I live near four Asian supermarkets. They are all close to each other, within two minutes of walking. This is very convenient for buying groceries.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a diverse neighborhood with many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses in the neighborhood are owned by Asian people. There is also a park near where I live. It has many things for people to do, like basketball courts, a soccer field, and swings for kids. People of all kinds play together in the park.\n\nThere are not many big office buildings in Bensonhurst. Most of the buildings are for people who live in apartments or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this neighborhood are generally nice. However, it can be noisy. Cars often drive by with loud music. People also drive quickly and loudly. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I had a bad experience in the past, but it was a long time ago. There are also people who steal packages. In New York City, people must clean up after their dogs. But many people do not do this in Bensonhurst. You often see dog waste on the street. My big complaint is the dog waste. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "In the place where I live, there are not many sidewalks. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call this hill the \"workout hill\" because many runners go there to exercise every day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is rough and not very safe to drive on in some places.\n\nMany telephone and electric wires are above the street. They look old and damaged because strong winds often knock them down. People fix them often, but they still look bad. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. However, people don't like them. They want to cut down the trees because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to see the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange.\n\nThe weather is often cloudy. Most days are overcast and wet. Moss grows on everything: houses, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month, and it was covered in moss. I had to spend three hours cleaning it. There are not many children in my area. Most people are old and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. Dogs are common in the neighborhood. You often see them in people's yards or running in the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it outside.\n\nWild rabbits live in the area. They are big and like to dig in gardens and lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We have a few stores near the water, but if you walk downhill, you can find more restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no big beach, but casting stones into the water is fun. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side of the bay even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My street is in a quiet neighborhood. It is between two big roads, so we see some traffic. Most people do their work in their yards and daily tasks. I know most of my neighbors. They like to walk and exercise their dogs. Children ride their bicycles. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife and I, and our two daughters, ten and fourteen years old. This means we see our neighbors often.\n\nWe like to play outside. We even play in the rain. We sometimes grill food on our back porch. It smells good. Many people cut their grass. We hear a lot of lawn mowers from March to October.\n\nOur neighborhood is surrounded by trees. This means it is cool and shady. But in the fall, we have a lot of leaves. We must clean them up. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe do not have much winter. It seems like fall is very long. Our garage is at the back of our house. I work in the garage on my truck and other projects. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to my neighbors.\n\nOn holidays, it is quiet. Some families visit from other places on Thanksgiving and other special days. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. The only thing I do not like is that our street is a through street.",
            "My home is in a dry desert area. It is very hot. The ground is brown. You see brown everywhere. When you see a green lawn, it means the owner works very hard to keep it green. I have lived here since the 1990s. The houses were far apart. Now, more people have moved in. The area looks like a city. Many places are changing like this. The people here are friendly. But, like in any city, some people are nice and some are not. I like my neighborhood. There are old people who are friendly. The stores here are like big chain stores. They sell food and other things. There are no special stores like Whole Foods. If you want to buy food from a special store, you must travel far. The main jobs here are in construction. Many people build houses and buildings. This is because the area is not fully developed. It has many empty spaces. I like it the way it is now. I came from a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install walls and bars. One good thing about my home is the animals. Many people come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has many types of animals and plants. It is hard to protect the desert, but we must. We must learn about the animals that live here. My family and I like the animals. My children like lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some good places to visit. Victorville is a good place for families. You can see the desert and do fun things. If you come, visit the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn to ski.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum is interesting. It has rocks and old bones from the desert. It also has things from Native American people and old objects that tell us about the history of Victorville. If you like the desert and its history, visit the museum.",
            "I live in a college campus. This is my neighborhood. I live in a dormitory with many people. The people who live in my dorm are my community. I also think of the campus and buildings around my dorm as my neighborhood. \n\nMy neighborhood has many things like other neighborhoods. There are houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses. \n\nFirst, there are apartments. Two to four people live in each room. Each floor has four to six rooms. So, 20 people live in each building. \n\nSecond, there are houses that people can rent. They have two to four bedrooms. Alumni usually live in these houses. But there are not many of these houses.\n\nThird, there are dorm rooms. Many students live in these rooms. Two people usually share a room. This is the most common kind of housing in my neighborhood. \n\nLet's talk about the people. My school likes diversity. The neighborhood has people from many countries and ages. Staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms. Old students live in apartments. \n\nNow, let's talk about the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. The stores sell food, school clothes, and groceries. You can find everything you need in my neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. At first, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my family. I missed my old home. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. We have a new, safer home now. We also have a better high school. I made some new friends and some new enemies in school. I knew a few neighbors very well. Mr. Glen and his family are nice. They live next door to us. I like them. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I caught a piece of his wife's shoe when she took it off! I also danced a lot. A girl from Mr. Glen's family, Marsharii, is a friend. I don't see her now.\n\nOur neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS now, so I can explore it more. I like to walk in the park. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by throwing sticks. I have a wooden sword and like to play with it. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and my friend. We had a good time.\n\nI have many happy memories here. I hope I will have more in the future.",
            "I live near the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. Some restaurants and bars are near my home. They are not very expensive. One bar changed its name. It is more expensive, but the service and drinks are good. Most people are friendly. They are students or low-income people. They live here because the rent is not high. There is an elementary school close to my home. Many children live here. I don't know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My apartment building put a special air cleaner near their door. It makes the air smell good. I think it's funny.\n\nThe buildings near me are old. But they may have new inside. There are new apartments down the street. But I don't like them. They are not well built. The rent is high. I think it's not fair. Many people live in these buildings because they are near the campus. Across the street from my home is a cheap restaurant. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near the restaurant. I heard it's a bad place to work. The city gave money to fix the road near my home. Now the sidewalk is wide and there is grass on the side of the road. The area is nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down. But I like the trees near my home.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad. The buildings look old and dirty. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the bad buildings. Most crimes happen at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But I don't blame them alone. There are other apartments on my street that have problems. There are many trees on my street. I like living here. It's affordable. There are many useful things near my home. I like that the university is close and there are two bus stops. I can easily go to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It has many houses. They look like separate houses because they are far apart. Each house is yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. People here are friendly. They like to talk to each other. On some evenings, we stand in our driveways and visit. Our children play outside with toys and chalk. We enjoy this. It is a good feeling in a world with many machines. It feels like the past.\n\nOur neighborhood has fields, trees, and blue skies. We see white clouds. This is nice. But sometimes we have bad weather. We had a big storm. We heard a warning and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog. My big dog was in the living room, barking. The storm was loud. We heard hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted when it hit the pavement. The sun came out, and it started to rain. We saw a rainbow. I took pictures.\n\nThe streets were quiet after the storm. People finally came home. We had dinner together. It is a friendly neighborhood. I like it. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. Our apartments are the same on the outside, but different inside. Some are small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I see deer. In the morning, I hear a frog singing. It is a good place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters singing. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved here when I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard at first. I became friends with two people who lived nearby. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. The same people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American neighborhoods. There are many houses with two floors. I often hear children playing outside on nice days. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. If you need help, people will help you. I have ordered packages online many times without any problems. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt playing football, but the good times are more important. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my younger cousins. They like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad because it reminds me of good times. My neighborhood is very different from others because it has many types of food. We have Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants near us. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and many pizza shops. You can find everything you need at the stores. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store on the same street. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I see bad news on social media, I am thankful for my good neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. Johnston is a special place. It is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town signs say. \n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the summer. Some houses have gray shingles. They are not near the road. They are in the fields. \n\nIn the town, there is one traffic light. This is where people buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for Cherry Coca-Cola. \n\nThere is one small grocery store called IGA. People go there to buy a few things. Most people go to a bigger store in a nearby town to buy their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. It is always busy. There is a small furniture store. The woman who runs it is kind. She has two men to help deliver the furniture. Next to the store is a place to take care of pets. They cut their hair and take care of them. \n\nThere is a small school for little kids. When they grow up, they go to school in the next town. There is no park in the town. But they are making a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. It will have a place for kids to play and people to walk their dogs. The town is small. People can walk by it without noticing it.",
            "I first heard about my home on a podcast about people who disappeared. This surprised me. Many apartments in the area cost over $1,000 per month. I never heard of this story and neither did my friends. We are struggling. Some of my friends cry at night because things are expensive. But we learned to save money. We like old toys and old clothes. We smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke or get used to things. The flea market is always there. It smells like old magazines on a piano. This smell stays even after you clean the piano.\n\nThere are three thrift stores close to my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The area is crowded, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend an afternoon.\n\nMore people and cars come here every year. It's a growing city. A big company that sells things online is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People don't ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet. You can keep your private life. The city is lively. There is music next door and singing upstairs. We have a good community. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. I'm lucky to live here. My neighbors are kind and I like them. We help each other.\n\nI live in a big apartment building, but my neighbors make me feel welcome.",

They are single family homes with small yards. The yards have grass and small stones. There is a short driveway. Everyone has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. You will not see holes in the road.\n\nMost houses are one story. Some are two stories. We do not have a special box for mail in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. My neighborhood is like a mix of a small town and the country. We have a lot of space. We have several swimming pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. We also have paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are older. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people living here. The city is big, but it feels like a small town. We have many things that people usually need, like a big store with many things inside. It takes 15 minutes to drive to anywhere important. When you get there, you can find many stores to choose from. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell things cheap.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things, like pools and paths. We are not close to big shopping, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. This area has low property values. Many people live here because they cannot afford to live in other parts of town. They rent or own small houses. My neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. People are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. However, it is still not bad. There have been a few violent crimes near my home. These include some shootings and one murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Fortunately, we have not had any big problems with crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch if we leave them outside. A big problem in our town is the opioid epidemic. Many people have died from overdoses. We have places to help people with addiction. These include centers for people to get help and training for families and friends. Despite the problems, our town has many good things. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and staff are very good. My son is happy there. The school takes care of children with special needs. He has no problems at school. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. We do not have to worry about our son going hungry. The city is making our town better. They have fixed roads and parks. However, they have done more work on the other side of town. Our side needs more help. This is a problem for us. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough stores for our needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years. We cannot think of living anywhere else.",

There is a fun bar a short walk away. People like to go there on warm summer nights. \n\nWhen it is cold, people who do not have homes sleep near the city park. The park is big. It has concrete and stairs around it. People can walk to the park from my building. They can also walk to a place where they can bathe and get warm.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the people. It used to be a bad place. Many years ago, there was a lot of violence. The government tried to clean it up. The people remember this. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. I think this is like the past. It makes me think about racism and unfair ideas. I like my neighborhood because the people are kind. They help each other. I have walked the streets at night and met many people. They have helped me when I needed it. I feel happy in my neighborhood.",

We also have a place to recycle and a baseball field where you can hear the announcers. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying overhead. Our ice cream shop is close by too. You can walk to the park and ride your bike to the ice cream store. It is a great place to live."
