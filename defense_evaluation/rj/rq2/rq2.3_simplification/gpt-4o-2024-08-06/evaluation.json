            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan, in Rural America. Here, farmland leads to small tourist cities. There are no big city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive to reach places. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places, with water all around. My town has water on both sides. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old, some are updated. Most have full basements you can see from the road. Many houses have older aluminum siding. There are houses in many colors around my house. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for pets. Houses look like Middle America. People work hard and raise families here.\n\nYou see kids running on the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who belongs and who does not. You wave at someone grilling outside or smile at a person walking their dog. Lawns are in good condition. Leaves are not piled up. Grass is green and cut. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It looks average but is special because it is a safe place to come home to. \n\nClose by, there is the county sheriff’s department and a jail. The Health Department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. Neighbors use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream. Downtown is close by. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is about eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood has a homeowner's association. When you enter, you see well-kept homes. The front yards are alike. There is grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Sometimes you see small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the street's end. Each person uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big lockers for packages. The homeowner's association likes everything to look the same. My house is on the edge of the city. So, my neighborhood is part rural and part suburban. We have a lot of land. There are many community pools. They are well-kept and have gates. There are walking trails too. You can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood for exercise. Most people here are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. There are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large by population but feels small. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is enough. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to important places. There are many stores to choose from. We have grocery stores with organic food. We also have bargain outlets with few items and few staff. My neighborhood is safe and well-kept. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you like.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was on a podcast. The podcast talked about people who went missing. It was a surprise to me. Almost every apartment here costs over a thousand dollars each month. I never heard about that story. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard here. Some friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money. We start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. We notice smells less as adults. We might smoke, or just get used to it. But the flea market always has a smell. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a piano. It stays in leather even after washing. Here, we have 3 thrift stores close by. If you start from one end, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is full of cars and people every morning. But the thrift store is quiet. No matter how busy the streets, the store is silent. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. They say the city is growing. It has one of the biggest online companies. It still has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People will not bother you. It is not like the South. There, if you care, you ask questions. Here, people do not pry. You can keep to yourself. The city moves like waves on a beach. It is lively here. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs keep it lively. We are more like a community than strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and mourn at funerals. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring mail to them, and they bring mail to me. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too. I live in a big, modern place. But my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not rich. Houses here do not cost much. Many people rent or own these houses who have low incomes. But the area looks nice and is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, but not too high. In the past ten years, there were a few violent crimes nearby, like shootings and one killing. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has only lost a few things from our porch if we leave them out. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are many resources to help, like addiction centers and Narcan training for families. Even with these problems, the town has good things. My son's school is great. The principal, teachers, and staff are excellent. My son has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is very positive. He likes it there. The PTO plans many events to involve families and help learning. More than 20% of our town's people are poor, so the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child goes hungry. No family is treated badly if they cannot pay. School fees, supplies, and trips cost little.\n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They fixed roads, planted flowers, and repaired parks. Sadly, most changes are in the center and west side, where shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This upsets people in my neighborhood. \n\nOverall, I like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. There are enough shops for my family. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history. I live in an apartment that is seven stories tall. It is across from an old theater. Down the hill is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. Often, there is a line of people waiting to get in, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are tall stairs in the wall. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and the steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot in winter. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near the only family center for miles. They can bathe and shower there. I love my city not just for its historic buildings or architecture. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop was once known for gang violence on the West Coast. People still tell stories of those times. The government tried to clean the streets. The people remember. Stories pass from generation to generation. People work hard to keep the area clean, even though it is still considered tough. They care about their city and their block. Some say if you are white, do not walk the Hill after dark. I think this is an old warning, from social conditioning. Maybe I look dark enough to fit in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. We all know the reminders of racism and fear. Even in a city that is supposed to be a melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking there at night. People offer a jacket more than they rob. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone to escape the rain. It is a place where, on dark nights, someone might stop, look at me, give me $5, and say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here then are still here now. My neighborhood is like a normal American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt once when I was elbowed in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than the bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin’s kids. They are younger and like swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park also makes me remember the past. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and found in most suburban areas. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store. You can buy Indian food there. Overall, I like my neighborhood. Reading on social media and watching the news about bad neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I attend. I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are some restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar was renamed and now costs more, but it is not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or people with less money because the apartments are cheap. There are many children because there is a school near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors and do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think it is funny. The buildings around me are old but may have new insides. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them because they were not built well. They are expensive to rent. I think this is unfair, but they are close to campus. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk and more grass, so the area looks better. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many. Behind my apartment is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd street. Behind it is 43rd street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken. The buildings look shabby. There are many trees, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment on that street, but it is not only them. Apartments across from me also have crime and many people move in and out. I like where I live. I can afford it, and many useful places are nearby. The university is close, and there are two bus stops. I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has houses that look like two homes joined together. They are at the end of a street that does not go through. The houses are spread out so they look like single homes. Each house is yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people are friends. Some nights, we stand at a driveway and talk while children play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It feels good in this world full of machines and computers. It feels like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. The bad part? This season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado alarms, so we went to a safe place. I stayed in the bathtub with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog would not come into the bathroom. He stayed in the living room, barking because of the strange situation. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming because the temperature changed fast. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted when it hit the hot road. I looked up and saw the sun come out as it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran into the house and got my camera. I took pictures to share with my friends and family online. They were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home after the storm. Then, life went back to normal, with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly place for someone who moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, just like everyone else. The outside of the houses is the same, but the inside can be different. Some are small. It does not make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. A donkey at a nearby farm brays at night to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I felt sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved the people there. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with good housing and a better high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" \n\nOver the years, I got used to the new place. I made some new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next to us. They are nice people, and I almost think of them as family. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my mom, dad, and sister. It was a fun time. I look forward to having my own wedding someday. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, threw the white strap from her leg, I caught it! I did not catch the flowers, though. We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well now.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to explore it more. I have gone out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and at peace. I practice balance with sticks I bought and sometimes use my wooden sword. I enjoy doing things I love. There is a basketball and tennis court here. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught my best friend and me to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard but always had fun.\n\nI have had many fun times in this neighborhood, and I think the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not very different from other towns in South Carolina, but it is important for farming. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. The town sign proudly says this. Most of the land has peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the center of town are far apart. Many are two stories with metal roofs or gray shingles to stay cool in summer. These houses are often not near the road, but farther back with fields in front for animals or crops. In the center of town, there is one stoplight at a four-way crossing. This is where the only stores are. You can get \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese family restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small, costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town, but people often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, owned by a kind local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and has two movers to deliver furniture. Next to it is a small pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and baths. Both a doctor's office and a vet are outside the center of town. They are small but help the people in Johnston. There is one school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but they are making a new 2.5-acre area for families to enjoy and to attract visitors. There is not much to do here. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, places to hang out, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or many restaurants. Even so, it is a nice town. It is so small you might pass by it without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. There is a lot of traffic, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move away or come to live here. I know most of our neighbors. People do yard work and other chores. In winter, we sled on a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see everyone come and go. We know the cars they drive. If we see a new car, we notice it. Neighbors walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes and play. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. Our daughters are eleven and fourteen years old. People know us well here. We play outside often, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You hear lawn mowers from March to October. Our area has many trees. It was once a forest. There is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means Fall is here. Winters are not very cold now. It feels like Fall lasts longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only if someone knocks. That does not happen often. I work on my truck or projects in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, families visit. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. People who have not lived here may not know how it feels to see only brown. When you see a green lawn, you know that person pays a lot for lawn care. In the 90s, when I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now there are many new houses, but it is still mostly the same. This place looks more like a city now, but many places are changing like this. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I am with friendly old people, so it is a nice area. The stores here are chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want fancy stores, you have to travel. I do not see stores like Whole Foods here. The main jobs in my city seem to be in construction. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build on. I like it the way it is now and do not want it to become too big. I left a big city and do not want to return to that life. I work full-time in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals at my home. People come to the high desert for the beauty of the desert. The climate and land here create a special ecosystem. This needs protection and is home to many animals. People living in the high desert should learn about the animals here to live well with them. My family and I get along well with the wildlife. I have three children who love lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can give you a different experience. Try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will make your visit fun. Nearby, you can go to Wrightwood to see snowy mountains and learn winter sports. Are you interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert? The Victor Valley Museum has old rocks, Native American items, and other things that tell the history of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of houses and streets. For me, my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus area around is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like a normal neighborhood in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet me talk about the \"houses\" first. There are three kinds of houses here: apartments, real houses, and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in each room. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people who are part of the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms, mostly for alumni. There are not many of these houses because they are not efficient. Dorms have hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNext, I will talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from all cultures and ages live here. Staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food and school clothes. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone to play. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it each day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be a bit hard to drive on. Some of the wires for telephone and electric look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The many repairs make the wires look patched up. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high on the hill, with big glass windows to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up and the sky turns orange. It is often cloudy, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in my driveway for a month, and when I went to use it, it was green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children where I live, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older and many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, dogs might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to make it leave through the front door. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have chased most away. We also have birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transportation in New York City is very good. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood, so it feels like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores in the area. In the last 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very popular. People like these stores because they have good food, low prices, and are easy to reach. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes getting groceries easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is a mix of many people, including immigrants and their children. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park nearby with basketball courts, a large field, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed, with people from many backgrounds playing together. There are not many big office buildings here. You will find co-op and condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People here are nice but can be loud. You often hear loud music from cars on the street. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but you might meet people who cause trouble. I was bullied here long ago, and there are package thieves. Also, many people do not clean up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on the street every morning. Be careful not to step in it and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the word \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" It is written on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. Some people think this slogan means to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's. At that time, Portland was less known and less costly. It had many creative and unique groups. To others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland, where being called weird is now a good thing. Even though many wealthy people from California have moved here, and many new condos are built for them, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern things and modern problems. Like the rest of the country, we buy most things from China. There are many ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses and home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with things someone does not want anymore, but they can be plastic bags or boxes too. They often hold clothes and books but can have anything. The magic of finding a treasure just right for the person walking by is what Portland is about. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never think of picking their clothes from a box on the street. Those people go to goat yoga (yoga with real goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who like many different things. It is full of people who follow dreams or think about dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems often come from mental health problems. The constant rain and gray clouds may add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one seems to know what to do about it. The homeless come here for social services, which are better than in most places, but still not enough. People who are not homeless feel both care and dislike. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are to the north. They see the sun rise and set. I may forget them because of work and life, but they do not change. On days when I am very stressed, they ask me to see them. When I do, they help me find peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I moved here when I started college. The mountains north of the campus first caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are what I love most. The town is also nice. There are many cafés where I studied hard. I can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, the old bricks of restaurants and offices give a feeling of history. This town can be as busy as a big city. But it is also calm and quiet. After a few blocks, I can leave the busy area by going past the library. This mix of different places makes the city special and exciting. It is easy to make many good memories here. I remember walking by the park with friends or running downtown to see a movie with tickets from the university. There are also hard memories, as in any place. The ponds are good for thinking or crying late at night. I know this well. I watch turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives. I wonder about my purpose. I walk past the pond, the park, and small houses. I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and the sky. I see the sunrise and know I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They remind me to keep going.",
            "At first, you might not notice it. It is a place behind shops, where you do not think people live. But if you walk past the old Whole Foods and the empty hotels that are busy only in summer, you will find a busy area. Here, there are many apartments. They are next to each other like a row of dolls. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about them. But the other apartments are different. Across from them is a small part of a community college. Students come here in the morning with coffee, yawning as they start their day. Cars wait as the students enter, and drivers get upset when there are many students. The road meets another road by a park and a place where people heal from broken bones. The healing place has nice chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and do tricks, while bees fly around flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. There is a sushi place by the park where food is cheap. Next to it is a swimming store and a nail salon. You can do many things here at once. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens hang out. They eat yogurt and do tricks on skateboards. This neighborhood is a picture of America in the quiet south, where things do not change much.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. Some homes are split into two, but they are still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the left. It looks like many others here, reminding you of when the suburbs were the American dream. This dream once was strong in this country, but now it is not as strong. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we hold onto it as best we can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not kept as well, but there is still a car or two in every driveway. Children play as if this place is their whole world. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands, giving hope to the young and memories to the older people. There are few churches, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are full. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family, maybe the only Arab family here. Most people are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football, stopping only to let cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations. They can tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when karate movies stopped being made, kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There is also a small movie theater that plays old movies at a low price. Young people do not go there much because they want new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and peaceful. An expressway goes through our town, but the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a request for an exit here. Young people wanted it, but older ones did not. They said it would ruin the town, and they convinced the city council to say no. A new high school is being built, and we are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best show what my town is like.",
            "I live in a big city, and my neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are spread out between places for business. Many kinds of businesses are here. Some have offices, while others are stores, places to eat, or places for fun. There are always new places to eat or shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small shops are also liked. These shops are in malls and along streets near homes. These streets make the area busy, but parks are also nearby. People often go to parks with their children.\n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There is a strong LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different places. The city has places like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, not far away. But driving a short way can take a long time because of traffic, especially during busy times. Few people walk in my city. The city is large, and most people do not like to walk far. So, the traffic is very bad, and parking is hard to find.\n\nThere has been a lot of building in recent years. Many big apartment buildings are being added. The city is popular, but some people do not like more people and cars coming. There are many kinds of homes here. Not all people want to live in big apartments. There are houses, small apartment buildings, and condos. Some places have single-family homes, others have duplexes. This is true in my neighborhood, so there are many choices for homes. People here are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was a child.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields. The fields seemed to go on forever. “This is it!” I said. I knew she would be surprised by how open the land was. She came from a town where the grocery store was a short walk from her home. She had never seen this much open space before. Seeing all the corn fields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood who I was and where I was from. \n\nWe drove down a small country road. We passed a quarry with water in it. Just past it is where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land around it. Everyone takes pride in their yard. In spring, many flowers bloom. The trees change with each season. The driveways are filled with luxury cars that shine in the sun after a wash. \n\nAs we got closer to my grey stucco home, we saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the day mowing his lawn and sings while he works. Everyone enjoys his singing. He is a nice person with a special history. He used to be a doctor. Now, he blends in with the grass on his mower. \n\nThen, you reach my home. In the side yard, there are many geese. Our Terrier chases them. Out back, there is a small stream that leads to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a wooden bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. We built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do with friends. \n\nWinters in my town can be very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard turns from green to white. The trees look bare. When it snows, everything is covered in white. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We often fought as kids. In winter, we had snowball fights. We built forts with branches. In our snowy world, we played pretend and nothing else mattered. We were just kids having fun."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan, in Rural America. Here, farmland leads to small tourist cities. There are no big city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive to reach places. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places, with water all around. My town has water on both sides. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old, some are updated. Most have full basements you can see from the road. Many houses have older aluminum siding. There are houses in many colors around my house. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for pets. Houses look like Middle America. People work hard and raise families here.\n\nYou see kids running on the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who belongs and who does not. You wave at someone grilling outside or smile at a person walking their dog. Lawns are in good condition. Leaves are not piled up. Grass is green and cut. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It looks average but is special because it is a safe place to come home to. \n\nClose by, there is the county sheriff’s department and a jail. The Health Department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. Neighbors use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream. Downtown is close by. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is about eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood has a homeowner's association. When you enter, you see well-kept homes. The front yards are alike. There is grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Sometimes you see small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the street's end. Each person uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big lockers for packages. The homeowner's association likes everything to look the same. My house is on the edge of the city. So, my neighborhood is part rural and part suburban. We have a lot of land. There are many community pools. They are well-kept and have gates. There are walking trails too. You can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood for exercise. Most people here are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. There are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large by population but feels small. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is enough. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to important places. There are many stores to choose from. We have grocery stores with organic food. We also have bargain outlets with few items and few staff. My neighborhood is safe and well-kept. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you like.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was on a podcast. The podcast talked about people who went missing. It was a surprise to me. Almost every apartment here costs over a thousand dollars each month. I never heard about that story. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard here. Some friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money. We start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. We notice smells less as adults. We might smoke, or just get used to it. But the flea market always has a smell. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a piano. It stays in leather even after washing. Here, we have 3 thrift stores close by. If you start from one end, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is full of cars and people every morning. But the thrift store is quiet. No matter how busy the streets, the store is silent. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. They say the city is growing. It has one of the biggest online companies. It still has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People will not bother you. It is not like the South. There, if you care, you ask questions. Here, people do not pry. You can keep to yourself. The city moves like waves on a beach. It is lively here. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs keep it lively. We are more like a community than strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and mourn at funerals. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring mail to them, and they bring mail to me. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too. I live in a big, modern place. But my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not rich. Houses here do not cost much. Many people rent or own these houses who have low incomes. But the area looks nice and is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, but not too high. In the past ten years, there were a few violent crimes nearby, like shootings and one killing. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has only lost a few things from our porch if we leave them out. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are many resources to help, like addiction centers and Narcan training for families. Even with these problems, the town has good things. My son's school is great. The principal, teachers, and staff are excellent. My son has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is very positive. He likes it there. The PTO plans many events to involve families and help learning. More than 20% of our town's people are poor, so the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child goes hungry. No family is treated badly if they cannot pay. School fees, supplies, and trips cost little.\n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They fixed roads, planted flowers, and repaired parks. Sadly, most changes are in the center and west side, where shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This upsets people in my neighborhood. \n\nOverall, I like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. There are enough shops for my family. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history. I live in an apartment that is seven stories tall. It is across from an old theater. Down the hill is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. Often, there is a line of people waiting to get in, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are tall stairs in the wall. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and the steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot in winter. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near the only family center for miles. They can bathe and shower there. I love my city not just for its historic buildings or architecture. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop was once known for gang violence on the West Coast. People still tell stories of those times. The government tried to clean the streets. The people remember. Stories pass from generation to generation. People work hard to keep the area clean, even though it is still considered tough. They care about their city and their block. Some say if you are white, do not walk the Hill after dark. I think this is an old warning, from social conditioning. Maybe I look dark enough to fit in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. We all know the reminders of racism and fear. Even in a city that is supposed to be a melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking there at night. People offer a jacket more than they rob. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone to escape the rain. It is a place where, on dark nights, someone might stop, look at me, give me $5, and say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here then are still here now. My neighborhood is like a normal American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt once when I was elbowed in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than the bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin’s kids. They are younger and like swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park also makes me remember the past. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and found in most suburban areas. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store. You can buy Indian food there. Overall, I like my neighborhood. Reading on social media and watching the news about bad neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I attend. I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are some restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar was renamed and now costs more, but it is not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or people with less money because the apartments are cheap. There are many children because there is a school near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors and do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think it is funny. The buildings around me are old but may have new insides. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them because they were not built well. They are expensive to rent. I think this is unfair, but they are close to campus. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk and more grass, so the area looks better. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many. Behind my apartment is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd street. Behind it is 43rd street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken. The buildings look shabby. There are many trees, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment on that street, but it is not only them. Apartments across from me also have crime and many people move in and out. I like where I live. I can afford it, and many useful places are nearby. The university is close, and there are two bus stops. I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has houses that look like two homes joined together. They are at the end of a street that does not go through. The houses are spread out so they look like single homes. Each house is yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people are friends. Some nights, we stand at a driveway and talk while children play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It feels good in this world full of machines and computers. It feels like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. The bad part? This season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado alarms, so we went to a safe place. I stayed in the bathtub with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog would not come into the bathroom. He stayed in the living room, barking because of the strange situation. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming because the temperature changed fast. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted when it hit the hot road. I looked up and saw the sun come out as it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran into the house and got my camera. I took pictures to share with my friends and family online. They were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home after the storm. Then, life went back to normal, with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly place for someone who moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, just like everyone else. The outside of the houses is the same, but the inside can be different. Some are small. It does not make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. A donkey at a nearby farm brays at night to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I felt sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved the people there. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with good housing and a better high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" \n\nOver the years, I got used to the new place. I made some new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next to us. They are nice people, and I almost think of them as family. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my mom, dad, and sister. It was a fun time. I look forward to having my own wedding someday. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, threw the white strap from her leg, I caught it! I did not catch the flowers, though. We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well now.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to explore it more. I have gone out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and at peace. I practice balance with sticks I bought and sometimes use my wooden sword. I enjoy doing things I love. There is a basketball and tennis court here. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught my best friend and me to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard but always had fun.\n\nI have had many fun times in this neighborhood, and I think the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not very different from other towns in South Carolina, but it is important for farming. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. The town sign proudly says this. Most of the land has peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the center of town are far apart. Many are two stories with metal roofs or gray shingles to stay cool in summer. These houses are often not near the road, but farther back with fields in front for animals or crops. In the center of town, there is one stoplight at a four-way crossing. This is where the only stores are. You can get \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese family restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small, costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town, but people often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, owned by a kind local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and has two movers to deliver furniture. Next to it is a small pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and baths. Both a doctor's office and a vet are outside the center of town. They are small but help the people in Johnston. There is one school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but they are making a new 2.5-acre area for families to enjoy and to attract visitors. There is not much to do here. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, places to hang out, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or many restaurants. Even so, it is a nice town. It is so small you might pass by it without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. There is a lot of traffic, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move away or come to live here. I know most of our neighbors. People do yard work and other chores. In winter, we sled on a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see everyone come and go. We know the cars they drive. If we see a new car, we notice it. Neighbors walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes and play. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. Our daughters are eleven and fourteen years old. People know us well here. We play outside often, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You hear lawn mowers from March to October. Our area has many trees. It was once a forest. There is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means Fall is here. Winters are not very cold now. It feels like Fall lasts longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only if someone knocks. That does not happen often. I work on my truck or projects in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, families visit. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. People who have not lived here may not know how it feels to see only brown. When you see a green lawn, you know that person pays a lot for lawn care. In the 90s, when I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now there are many new houses, but it is still mostly the same. This place looks more like a city now, but many places are changing like this. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I am with friendly old people, so it is a nice area. The stores here are chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want fancy stores, you have to travel. I do not see stores like Whole Foods here. The main jobs in my city seem to be in construction. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build on. I like it the way it is now and do not want it to become too big. I left a big city and do not want to return to that life. I work full-time in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals at my home. People come to the high desert for the beauty of the desert. The climate and land here create a special ecosystem. This needs protection and is home to many animals. People living in the high desert should learn about the animals here to live well with them. My family and I get along well with the wildlife. I have three children who love lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can give you a different experience. Try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will make your visit fun. Nearby, you can go to Wrightwood to see snowy mountains and learn winter sports. Are you interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert? The Victor Valley Museum has old rocks, Native American items, and other things that tell the history of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of houses and streets. For me, my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus area around is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like a normal neighborhood in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet me talk about the \"houses\" first. There are three kinds of houses here: apartments, real houses, and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in each room. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people who are part of the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms, mostly for alumni. There are not many of these houses because they are not efficient. Dorms have hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNext, I will talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from all cultures and ages live here. Staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food and school clothes. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone to play. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it each day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be a bit hard to drive on. Some of the wires for telephone and electric look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The many repairs make the wires look patched up. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high on the hill, with big glass windows to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up and the sky turns orange. It is often cloudy, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in my driveway for a month, and when I went to use it, it was green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children where I live, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older and many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, dogs might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to make it leave through the front door. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have chased most away. We also have birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transportation in New York City is very good. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood, so it feels like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores in the area. In the last 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very popular. People like these stores because they have good food, low prices, and are easy to reach. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes getting groceries easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is a mix of many people, including immigrants and their children. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park nearby with basketball courts, a large field, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed, with people from many backgrounds playing together. There are not many big office buildings here. You will find co-op and condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People here are nice but can be loud. You often hear loud music from cars on the street. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but you might meet people who cause trouble. I was bullied here long ago, and there are package thieves. Also, many people do not clean up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on the street every morning. Be careful not to step in it and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the word \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" It is written on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. Some people think this slogan means to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's. At that time, Portland was less known and less costly. It had many creative and unique groups. To others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland, where being called weird is now a good thing. Even though many wealthy people from California have moved here, and many new condos are built for them, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern things and modern problems. Like the rest of the country, we buy most things from China. There are many ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses and home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with things someone does not want anymore, but they can be plastic bags or boxes too. They often hold clothes and books but can have anything. The magic of finding a treasure just right for the person walking by is what Portland is about. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never think of picking their clothes from a box on the street. Those people go to goat yoga (yoga with real goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who like many different things. It is full of people who follow dreams or think about dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems often come from mental health problems. The constant rain and gray clouds may add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one seems to know what to do about it. The homeless come here for social services, which are better than in most places, but still not enough. People who are not homeless feel both care and dislike. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are to the north. They see the sun rise and set. I may forget them because of work and life, but they do not change. On days when I am very stressed, they ask me to see them. When I do, they help me find peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I moved here when I started college. The mountains north of the campus first caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are what I love most. The town is also nice. There are many cafés where I studied hard. I can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, the old bricks of restaurants and offices give a feeling of history. This town can be as busy as a big city. But it is also calm and quiet. After a few blocks, I can leave the busy area by going past the library. This mix of different places makes the city special and exciting. It is easy to make many good memories here. I remember walking by the park with friends or running downtown to see a movie with tickets from the university. There are also hard memories, as in any place. The ponds are good for thinking or crying late at night. I know this well. I watch turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives. I wonder about my purpose. I walk past the pond, the park, and small houses. I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and the sky. I see the sunrise and know I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They remind me to keep going.",
            "At first, you might not notice it. It is a place behind shops, where you do not think people live. But if you walk past the old Whole Foods and the empty hotels that are busy only in summer, you will find a busy area. Here, there are many apartments. They are next to each other like a row of dolls. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about them. But the other apartments are different. Across from them is a small part of a community college. Students come here in the morning with coffee, yawning as they start their day. Cars wait as the students enter, and drivers get upset when there are many students. The road meets another road by a park and a place where people heal from broken bones. The healing place has nice chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and do tricks, while bees fly around flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. There is a sushi place by the park where food is cheap. Next to it is a swimming store and a nail salon. You can do many things here at once. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens hang out. They eat yogurt and do tricks on skateboards. This neighborhood is a picture of America in the quiet south, where things do not change much.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. Some homes are split into two, but they are still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the left. It looks like many others here, reminding you of when the suburbs were the American dream. This dream once was strong in this country, but now it is not as strong. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we hold onto it as best we can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not kept as well, but there is still a car or two in every driveway. Children play as if this place is their whole world. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands, giving hope to the young and memories to the older people. There are few churches, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are full. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family, maybe the only Arab family here. Most people are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football, stopping only to let cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations. They can tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when karate movies stopped being made, kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There is also a small movie theater that plays old movies at a low price. Young people do not go there much because they want new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and peaceful. An expressway goes through our town, but the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a request for an exit here. Young people wanted it, but older ones did not. They said it would ruin the town, and they convinced the city council to say no. A new high school is being built, and we are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best show what my town is like.",
            "I live in a big city, and my neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are spread out between places for business. Many kinds of businesses are here. Some have offices, while others are stores, places to eat, or places for fun. There are always new places to eat or shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small shops are also liked. These shops are in malls and along streets near homes. These streets make the area busy, but parks are also nearby. People often go to parks with their children.\n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There is a strong LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different places. The city has places like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, not far away. But driving a short way can take a long time because of traffic, especially during busy times. Few people walk in my city. The city is large, and most people do not like to walk far. So, the traffic is very bad, and parking is hard to find.\n\nThere has been a lot of building in recent years. Many big apartment buildings are being added. The city is popular, but some people do not like more people and cars coming. There are many kinds of homes here. Not all people want to live in big apartments. There are houses, small apartment buildings, and condos. Some places have single-family homes, others have duplexes. This is true in my neighborhood, so there are many choices for homes. People here are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was a child.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields. The fields seemed to go on forever. “This is it!” I said. I knew she would be surprised by how open the land was. She came from a town where the grocery store was a short walk from her home. She had never seen this much open space before. Seeing all the corn fields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood who I was and where I was from. \n\nWe drove down a small country road. We passed a quarry with water in it. Just past it is where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land around it. Everyone takes pride in their yard. In spring, many flowers bloom. The trees change with each season. The driveways are filled with luxury cars that shine in the sun after a wash. \n\nAs we got closer to my grey stucco home, we saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the day mowing his lawn and sings while he works. Everyone enjoys his singing. He is a nice person with a special history. He used to be a doctor. Now, he blends in with the grass on his mower. \n\nThen, you reach my home. In the side yard, there are many geese. Our Terrier chases them. Out back, there is a small stream that leads to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a wooden bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. We built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do with friends. \n\nWinters in my town can be very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard turns from green to white. The trees look bare. When it snows, everything is covered in white. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We often fought as kids. In winter, we had snowball fights. We built forts with branches. In our snowy world, we played pretend and nothing else mattered. We were just kids having fun."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan, in Rural America. Here, farmland leads to small tourist cities. There are no big city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive to reach places. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places, with water all around. My town has water on both sides. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old, some are updated. Most have full basements you can see from the road. Many houses have older aluminum siding. There are houses in many colors around my house. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for pets. Houses look like Middle America. People work hard and raise families here.\n\nYou see kids running on the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who belongs and who does not. You wave at someone grilling outside or smile at a person walking their dog. Lawns are in good condition. Leaves are not piled up. Grass is green and cut. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It looks average but is special because it is a safe place to come home to. \n\nClose by, there is the county sheriff’s department and a jail. The Health Department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. Neighbors use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream. Downtown is close by. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is about eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood has a homeowner's association. When you enter, you see well-kept homes. The front yards are alike. There is grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Sometimes you see small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the street's end. Each person uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big lockers for packages. The homeowner's association likes everything to look the same. My house is on the edge of the city. So, my neighborhood is part rural and part suburban. We have a lot of land. There are many community pools. They are well-kept and have gates. There are walking trails too. You can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood for exercise. Most people here are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. There are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large by population but feels small. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is enough. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to important places. There are many stores to choose from. We have grocery stores with organic food. We also have bargain outlets with few items and few staff. My neighborhood is safe and well-kept. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you like.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was on a podcast. The podcast talked about people who went missing. It was a surprise to me. Almost every apartment here costs over a thousand dollars each month. I never heard about that story. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard here. Some friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money. We start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. We notice smells less as adults. We might smoke, or just get used to it. But the flea market always has a smell. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a piano. It stays in leather even after washing. Here, we have 3 thrift stores close by. If you start from one end, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is full of cars and people every morning. But the thrift store is quiet. No matter how busy the streets, the store is silent. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. They say the city is growing. It has one of the biggest online companies. It still has problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People will not bother you. It is not like the South. There, if you care, you ask questions. Here, people do not pry. You can keep to yourself. The city moves like waves on a beach. It is lively here. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs keep it lively. We are more like a community than strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and mourn at funerals. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring mail to them, and they bring mail to me. It is nice to see them. I think they like me too. I live in a big, modern place. But my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not rich. Houses here do not cost much. Many people rent or own these houses who have low incomes. But the area looks nice and is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, but not too high. In the past ten years, there were a few violent crimes nearby, like shootings and one killing. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has only lost a few things from our porch if we leave them out. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are many resources to help, like addiction centers and Narcan training for families. Even with these problems, the town has good things. My son's school is great. The principal, teachers, and staff are excellent. My son has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is very positive. He likes it there. The PTO plans many events to involve families and help learning. More than 20% of our town's people are poor, so the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child goes hungry. No family is treated badly if they cannot pay. School fees, supplies, and trips cost little.\n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They fixed roads, planted flowers, and repaired parks. Sadly, most changes are in the center and west side, where shops and traffic are. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This upsets people in my neighborhood. \n\nOverall, I like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. There are enough shops for my family. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history. I live in an apartment that is seven stories tall. It is across from an old theater. Down the hill is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. Often, there is a line of people waiting to get in, especially on weekends in June and July. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete. There are tall stairs in the wall. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and the steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot in winter. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near the only family center for miles. They can bathe and shower there. I love my city not just for its historic buildings or architecture. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop was once known for gang violence on the West Coast. People still tell stories of those times. The government tried to clean the streets. The people remember. Stories pass from generation to generation. People work hard to keep the area clean, even though it is still considered tough. They care about their city and their block. Some say if you are white, do not walk the Hill after dark. I think this is an old warning, from social conditioning. Maybe I look dark enough to fit in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. We all know the reminders of racism and fear. Even in a city that is supposed to be a melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking there at night. People offer a jacket more than they rob. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone to escape the rain. It is a place where, on dark nights, someone might stop, look at me, give me $5, and say I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here then are still here now. My neighborhood is like a normal American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt once when I was elbowed in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than the bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin’s kids. They are younger and like swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park also makes me remember the past. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and found in most suburban areas. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store. You can buy Indian food there. Overall, I like my neighborhood. Reading on social media and watching the news about bad neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I attend. I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are some restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar was renamed and now costs more, but it is not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or people with less money because the apartments are cheap. There are many children because there is a school near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors and do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think it is funny. The buildings around me are old but may have new insides. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them because they were not built well. They are expensive to rent. I think this is unfair, but they are close to campus. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk and more grass, so the area looks better. My apartment building has many trees. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many. Behind my apartment is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd street. Behind it is 43rd street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken. The buildings look shabby. There are many trees, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment on that street, but it is not only them. Apartments across from me also have crime and many people move in and out. I like where I live. I can afford it, and many useful places are nearby. The university is close, and there are two bus stops. I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has houses that look like two homes joined together. They are at the end of a street that does not go through. The houses are spread out so they look like single homes. Each house is yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people are friends. Some nights, we stand at a driveway and talk while children play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It feels good in this world full of machines and computers. It feels like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. The bad part? This season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado alarms, so we went to a safe place. I stayed in the bathtub with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog would not come into the bathroom. He stayed in the living room, barking because of the strange situation. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming because the temperature changed fast. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted when it hit the hot road. I looked up and saw the sun come out as it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran into the house and got my camera. I took pictures to share with my friends and family online. They were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home after the storm. Then, life went back to normal, with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly place for someone who moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, just like everyone else. The outside of the houses is the same, but the inside can be different. Some are small. It does not make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. A donkey at a nearby farm brays at night to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I felt sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved the people there. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with good housing and a better high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" \n\nOver the years, I got used to the new place. I made some new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next to us. They are nice people, and I almost think of them as family. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my mom, dad, and sister. It was a fun time. I look forward to having my own wedding someday. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, threw the white strap from her leg, I caught it! I did not catch the flowers, though. We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well now.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to explore it more. I have gone out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and at peace. I practice balance with sticks I bought and sometimes use my wooden sword. I enjoy doing things I love. There is a basketball and tennis court here. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught my best friend and me to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard but always had fun.\n\nI have had many fun times in this neighborhood, and I think the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not very different from other towns in South Carolina, but it is important for farming. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. The town sign proudly says this. Most of the land has peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the center of town are far apart. Many are two stories with metal roofs or gray shingles to stay cool in summer. These houses are often not near the road, but farther back with fields in front for animals or crops. In the center of town, there is one stoplight at a four-way crossing. This is where the only stores are. You can get \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese family restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small, costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town, but people often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, owned by a kind local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and has two movers to deliver furniture. Next to it is a small pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and baths. Both a doctor's office and a vet are outside the center of town. They are small but help the people in Johnston. There is one school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but they are making a new 2.5-acre area for families to enjoy and to attract visitors. There is not much to do here. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, places to hang out, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or many restaurants. Even so, it is a nice town. It is so small you might pass by it without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. There is a lot of traffic, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move away or come to live here. I know most of our neighbors. People do yard work and other chores. In winter, we sled on a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see everyone come and go. We know the cars they drive. If we see a new car, we notice it. Neighbors walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes and play. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. Our daughters are eleven and fourteen years old. People know us well here. We play outside often, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You hear lawn mowers from March to October. Our area has many trees. It was once a forest. There is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means Fall is here. Winters are not very cold now. It feels like Fall lasts longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only if someone knocks. That does not happen often. I work on my truck or projects in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, families visit. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. People who have not lived here may not know how it feels to see only brown. When you see a green lawn, you know that person pays a lot for lawn care. In the 90s, when I first lived here, houses were far apart. Now there are many new houses, but it is still mostly the same. This place looks more like a city now, but many places are changing like this. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I am with friendly old people, so it is a nice area. The stores here are chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want fancy stores, you have to travel. I do not see stores like Whole Foods here. The main jobs in my city seem to be in construction. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build on. I like it the way it is now and do not want it to become too big. I left a big city and do not want to return to that life. I work full-time in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals at my home. People come to the high desert for the beauty of the desert. The climate and land here create a special ecosystem. This needs protection and is home to many animals. People living in the high desert should learn about the animals here to live well with them. My family and I get along well with the wildlife. I have three children who love lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can give you a different experience. Try to visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will make your visit fun. Nearby, you can go to Wrightwood to see snowy mountains and learn winter sports. Are you interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert? The Victor Valley Museum has old rocks, Native American items, and other things that tell the history of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of houses and streets. For me, my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus area around is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like a normal neighborhood in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet me talk about the \"houses\" first. There are three kinds of houses here: apartments, real houses, and dorms. In the apartments, 2-4 people live in each room. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people who are part of the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms, mostly for alumni. There are not many of these houses because they are not efficient. Dorms have hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNext, I will talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from all cultures and ages live here. Staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNow, let's talk about stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food and school clothes. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone to play. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it each day. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be a bit hard to drive on. Some of the wires for telephone and electric look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The many repairs make the wires look patched up. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high on the hill, with big glass windows to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up and the sky turns orange. It is often cloudy, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in my driveway for a month, and when I went to use it, it was green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children where I live, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older and many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, dogs might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to make it leave through the front door. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have chased most away. We also have birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transportation in New York City is very good. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood, so it feels like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores in the area. In the last 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very popular. People like these stores because they have good food, low prices, and are easy to reach. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes getting groceries easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is a mix of many people, including immigrants and their children. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park nearby with basketball courts, a large field, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed, with people from many backgrounds playing together. There are not many big office buildings here. You will find co-op and condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People here are nice but can be loud. You often hear loud music from cars on the street. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but you might meet people who cause trouble. I was bullied here long ago, and there are package thieves. Also, many people do not clean up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on the street every morning. Be careful not to step in it and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the word \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" It is written on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. Some people think this slogan means to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's. At that time, Portland was less known and less costly. It had many creative and unique groups. To others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland, where being called weird is now a good thing. Even though many wealthy people from California have moved here, and many new condos are built for them, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern things and modern problems. Like the rest of the country, we buy most things from China. There are many ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses and home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with things someone does not want anymore, but they can be plastic bags or boxes too. They often hold clothes and books but can have anything. The magic of finding a treasure just right for the person walking by is what Portland is about. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never think of picking their clothes from a box on the street. Those people go to goat yoga (yoga with real goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who like many different things. It is full of people who follow dreams or think about dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems often come from mental health problems. The constant rain and gray clouds may add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one seems to know what to do about it. The homeless come here for social services, which are better than in most places, but still not enough. People who are not homeless feel both care and dislike. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are to the north. They see the sun rise and set. I may forget them because of work and life, but they do not change. On days when I am very stressed, they ask me to see them. When I do, they help me find peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I moved here when I started college. The mountains north of the campus first caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are what I love most. The town is also nice. There are many cafés where I studied hard. I can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, the old bricks of restaurants and offices give a feeling of history. This town can be as busy as a big city. But it is also calm and quiet. After a few blocks, I can leave the busy area by going past the library. This mix of different places makes the city special and exciting. It is easy to make many good memories here. I remember walking by the park with friends or running downtown to see a movie with tickets from the university. There are also hard memories, as in any place. The ponds are good for thinking or crying late at night. I know this well. I watch turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives. I wonder about my purpose. I walk past the pond, the park, and small houses. I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and the sky. I see the sunrise and know I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They remind me to keep going.",
            "At first, you might not notice it. It is a place behind shops, where you do not think people live. But if you walk past the old Whole Foods and the empty hotels that are busy only in summer, you will find a busy area. Here, there are many apartments. They are next to each other like a row of dolls. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about them. But the other apartments are different. Across from them is a small part of a community college. Students come here in the morning with coffee, yawning as they start their day. Cars wait as the students enter, and drivers get upset when there are many students. The road meets another road by a park and a place where people heal from broken bones. The healing place has nice chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and do tricks, while bees fly around flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. There is a sushi place by the park where food is cheap. Next to it is a swimming store and a nail salon. You can do many things here at once. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens hang out. They eat yogurt and do tricks on skateboards. This neighborhood is a picture of America in the quiet south, where things do not change much.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. Some homes are split into two, but they are still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the left. It looks like many others here, reminding you of when the suburbs were the American dream. This dream once was strong in this country, but now it is not as strong. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we hold onto it as best we can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not kept as well, but there is still a car or two in every driveway. Children play as if this place is their whole world. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands, giving hope to the young and memories to the older people. There are few churches, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are full. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family, maybe the only Arab family here. Most people are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football, stopping only to let cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations. They can tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when karate movies stopped being made, kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There is also a small movie theater that plays old movies at a low price. Young people do not go there much because they want new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap and peaceful. An expressway goes through our town, but the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a request for an exit here. Young people wanted it, but older ones did not. They said it would ruin the town, and they convinced the city council to say no. A new high school is being built, and we are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best show what my town is like.",
            "I live in a big city, and my neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are spread out between places for business. Many kinds of businesses are here. Some have offices, while others are stores, places to eat, or places for fun. There are always new places to eat or shop. Some stores are big and well-known, but small shops are also liked. These shops are in malls and along streets near homes. These streets make the area busy, but parks are also nearby. People often go to parks with their children.\n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There is a strong LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different places. The city has places like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, not far away. But driving a short way can take a long time because of traffic, especially during busy times. Few people walk in my city. The city is large, and most people do not like to walk far. So, the traffic is very bad, and parking is hard to find.\n\nThere has been a lot of building in recent years. Many big apartment buildings are being added. The city is popular, but some people do not like more people and cars coming. There are many kinds of homes here. Not all people want to live in big apartments. There are houses, small apartment buildings, and condos. Some places have single-family homes, others have duplexes. This is true in my neighborhood, so there are many choices for homes. People here are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was a child.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields. The fields seemed to go on forever. “This is it!” I said. I knew she would be surprised by how open the land was. She came from a town where the grocery store was a short walk from her home. She had never seen this much open space before. Seeing all the corn fields, I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood who I was and where I was from. \n\nWe drove down a small country road. We passed a quarry with water in it. Just past it is where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land around it. Everyone takes pride in their yard. In spring, many flowers bloom. The trees change with each season. The driveways are filled with luxury cars that shine in the sun after a wash. \n\nAs we got closer to my grey stucco home, we saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly smile. He spends the day mowing his lawn and sings while he works. Everyone enjoys his singing. He is a nice person with a special history. He used to be a doctor. Now, he blends in with the grass on his mower. \n\nThen, you reach my home. In the side yard, there are many geese. Our Terrier chases them. Out back, there is a small stream that leads to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a wooden bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. We built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do with friends. \n\nWinters in my town can be very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard turns from green to white. The trees look bare. When it snows, everything is covered in white. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We often fought as kids. In winter, we had snowball fights. We built forts with branches. In our snowy world, we played pretend and nothing else mattered. We were just kids having fun."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You move from farmland to small cities for visitors. There are no big city stores like malls, Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive everywhere you need to go. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you look, there is a beach to enjoy. \n\nMy neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old and some are being fixed up. Most homes have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Many houses have older metal siding. Houses are many different colors. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. People work hard for a living and raise families. Kids play in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and skate. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. People wave to each other and smile. \n\nLawns are kept nice. No one has leaves from fall. Grass is green and cut. If there are plants and bushes, they are trimmed. The neighborhood may not look special, but it feels like a good place for families. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It shows what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. \n\nNearby is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields close by. You can hear the announcers call the game. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. \n\nYou can walk to buy ice cream from a local shop. You can also go downtown from the neighborhood. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association in my neighborhood. Because of this, the homes are well-kept. Front yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some yards have small trees. All houses have two-car garages. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one-story, but some are two-story. Mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to open our mailboxes. There are also two lockers for packages. This is due to the homeowner's association. My house is on the edge of the city. So, the area is part rural, part suburb. We have a lot of land. There are pools for people who live here. They are clean and gated. There are trails for walking dogs or walking alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place, and people care for each other. There are some middle-aged and young workers too. The city is large by population but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is fine. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to important places. There, I find many stores. We have high-end groceries with organic food. We also have bargain stores with a few items and low costs. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you want.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a show about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over the years. You start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. You notice smells less when you are older. You might start to smoke, or maybe you just get used to how things are. The flea market smell is strong. The smell of being an adult is dusty papers on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you wash it. Here, there are 3 thrift stores you can walk to. If you start at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. Even with many cars and people, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a large online trade and delivery company. It is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone follows their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and free, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we are less strangers and more like a group of friends. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave them food; they do the same for me. I bring them mail, and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy seeing me too. I live in a big, modern area, but people like my neighbors make me feel like my life is good.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My part of town is on the east side. It is not a rich area. Many people here have low income. Most houses are rented or owned by people with little money. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are nice. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit more common than in other parts of town, but not too much. There have been some violent crimes nearby in the last ten years, like shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. Our family has been lucky, with only small things taken from our porch. The town has been hit hard by the \"opioid epidemic,\" like many places in the United States. Many have died from drug overdoses. But there are resources here to help, like rehab centers and training for families of drug users. Despite these problems, my town has good points. My son’s school is great. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is welcoming. He loves it there. The PTO plans many events to get families involved. Over 20% of people in town are poor, so the school gives free meals to all students. No child goes hungry, and fees are kept low. The City Council has improved the town’s look by fixing roads, adding plants, and fixing parks. Sadly, these changes are mostly in the center and west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often ignored, which bothers us. Still, I like living here. People are friendly, schools are good, and there are enough stores for us. Our home may not be worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot think of living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from an old theater. A block down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. During weekends in June and July, there is often a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete, with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near a family center where they can wash. \n\nI love my city not for the old buildings or their beauty. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. Even now, people tell stories about those days. They remember when the government tried to clean the streets. People work hard to keep it clean. They still care about their city and block. People say that if you are white, you should not walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is from the old days. Maybe I am dark enough to not look all white, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city meant to be a cultural mix. But I know Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are kind and help each other. Laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone. People tell me I am beautiful and valuable, even on the greyest nights.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have good memories. Most people who lived here when I came are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but the good memories are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are young and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park now makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food is popular, and there are many pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian-owned store for Indian food. \n\nI like my neighborhood. I feel grateful when I hear stories about bad neighbors on social media or the news.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar got a new name and is more costly, but it has good service and drinks. Most people there are nice. They are either college students or have lower incomes since the apartments are not costly. There are many children around because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I think is funny and almost rude. The buildings near me look old but might have new interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I do not like them. The construction was not good. They are built cheaply, but rent is high because they are near the campus. I think that is unfair. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which I hear is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, and grass on the sides, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut some trees down, leaving stumps. But there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my place are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is behind and not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment there, but I cannot blame just them. There are problems across from me too. Despite this, I like where I live. I can afford it, and useful places are nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex houses on a cul-de-sac. They are spread out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. We often stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk while children play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern, busy world. It is like going back in time. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nBut this season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado sirens, so we went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog did not like the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail on the ground. After the storm, the road steamed because the temperature changed. It went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sky cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera. I took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They loved them, and so did I. The streets were quiet for another hour until people came home after the storm. Then life went back to normal with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly neighborhood for me, who just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the way people speak here with a southern accent. \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments inside are different. Some are small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog sing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm you can hear in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was very sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. So, we moved to a better place with good housing and a nice high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They live next to us. They are nice people, and I see them as family in some ways. I appreciate them a lot. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I enjoyed it. I look forward to having a good life in the future. At the wedding, I caught the strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers. We danced all night, and I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I explore it more with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I bring sticks from home depot to practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. There is a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. These are the ones that stand out to me. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not different from other towns in South Carolina, but it helps agriculture a lot. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on its welcome sign. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are usually set back from the road, with fields in front for animals or crops. In the main town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores are. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town. Many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A friendly woman runs it. The store has been in Johnston for many years. They have two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are away from the main town. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but the town is making a 2.5-acre recreation area for families and visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town and very small. You could pass it quickly without noticing.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. We have more cars on the street than I like. But it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs at home. In winter, we sled down a hill. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people come and go all day. We know the cars people drive. When we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We stay at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us, my wife and I, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People here know us well too. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The barbecue smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees because the area was once a forest. There is a lot of shade but also many leaves in the Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows that Fall is here. Winter has been mild lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only when someone knocks, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other things. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors from other places. We see many cars parked then. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt here. People who have not lived here might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a lawn, that person is spending much money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Many places are changing like this. Most of the time, people are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I live near kind old people. Stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you have to travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. The main jobs here are in construction. This city is still not very developed. There are many open spaces to build. That scares me because I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The high desert climate and land create ecosystems that need protection. These are home to many types of wildlife. People here should learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains. You can also take winter sports lessons there. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These show the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Many people have their own homes, but my place is not the same. I call the college campus where I live my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around us is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.  \n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Usually, there are 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms and often house alumni. There are only a few of these houses. The dorm rooms are the most common. They house many students, with two people sharing a room.  \n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments.  \n\nNext, we have stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores include dining places and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores. You can find everything you need here! The park is a clean and safe place for everyone. People in my neighborhood keep it that way.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downward, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be a bit unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines, and repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high up on the hill, with big glass windows on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines, and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you see sunlight through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. You often see them in lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have hunted most of them away. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores here, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will find it easy to get there. Public transportation is simple to use in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy place, so you will feel like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on almost every street. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like to shop at these places because the food is very good, prices are lower, and it is easy to shop there. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets close to each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is a mix of many people, with immigrants and their children. Many big stores here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park with many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in the summer. Parks in New York City have many different people. You will see many kids playing together. There are no big corporate buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses or apartments. The people are nice, but it is noisy. You hear loud music from cars and engines in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here years ago, and packages sometimes get stolen. Also, people do not pick up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that calls itself \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this sign on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. The slogan asks people to remember the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when the city was less known and cheaper. It was a time of creative and unique groups. For others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but they mean it as a good thing.\n\nMany people from California have moved to Portland. New buildings are being built for them. Still, Portland is weird. Weird means accepting things not usually accepted. It does not mean Portland lacks modern comforts or struggles. Like the rest of the country, most of our things come from China. There are many ways of being weird, but Portland has normal things too. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking life too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many in Portland, houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In summer, you can find free boxes on the streets. These are boxes where people put things they no longer need. Often, these boxes hold clothes and books, but they can have anything. You might find a perfect treasure in one of these boxes. This is the magic of a walk through Southeast Portland. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many.\n\nSome people here would not pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They might go to goat yoga or to a Timbers soccer game. Portland is full of people who love many things. We chase our dreams or think about our dreams while at the bar. Portland has a drug problem. This is often a mental health issue. The rain and clouds might make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one knows how to solve it. Many homeless people come here because Portland offers good services. But these services are not enough. People here feel both care and anger about the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they see the sun rise and set. I may forget them when busy with work and life, but they stay strong and calm. When I feel most stressed, they ask to be seen. I look at them and feel peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I first came here for college. The mountains north of campus caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold my heart. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied with lots of coffee. You can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, old brick buildings line the streets. It feels like a busy city. But just past the library, it becomes a quiet small town again. This mix makes the city feel special, like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. Like walking in the park after a night of study or going to a movie downtown. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are good for thinking or crying when life feels hard. I have done this a lot. I watch the turtles, ducks, and bugs and think about my purpose in life. I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses until I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and sky, and I realize I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They seem to speak and give me hope.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a place behind a shopping area. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go past the old Whole Foods and walk behind the hotels, you will find a community. These hotels are mostly empty except in the summer when families visit. \n\nIn this community, there are several apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like pieces of a puzzle. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about those. But the other apartments are different, and most people around here do not know about them. \n\nAcross the street is a small college campus. It is quiet. Students come with coffee in their hands, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers get upset when the traffic is slow on busy days. \n\nThe road meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones. The center has nice chairs on the porch and a fan moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and spin on the grass. Bees move around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. Teenage girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube. \n\nThere is a sushi place in the shopping strip by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store for swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken, all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt store. Teens like to go there. They eat yogurt with toppings, do tricks on skateboards, and vape because they think it is cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a small piece of America. It is a place in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some houses are split into two but still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for many in America. This dream once made people happy, but now it seems to be fading. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we try to hold onto it. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not as well-kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways, and children play as if their world is complete. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It offers hope to young people today and brings back memories for older folks. There are few churches, mostly empty, but basketball courts are still busy. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A.\" It is owned by a Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only when cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations and tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when movies about karate stopped being popular, kids lost interest. Now, it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at low prices. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it. It is a cheap night out without kids. There is one expressway near my town. The exit is in the next town. People wanted an exit for our town. Young people liked this idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would change our town, so they stopped it. A new high school is being built, and we need to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best for my town.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people and places. Homes are spread around the area. Shops and restaurants are nearby. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and popular. They are in malls and on the streets. These streets are close to homes that are usually quiet. There are parks near my home. Many people go there with their children. \n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There are LGBTQ+ groups, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. In other parts of the city, there are more people from different places. There are areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are not far, but traffic makes driving slow. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Most people drive because the city is big. Walking is not common. Parking is hard to find. \n\nThere has been much building in the city. Many new apartment buildings are going up. This city is a popular place to live. But, more people means more traffic. Some people are not happy about this. There are many types of homes. Some are big, others small. There are houses and small apartment buildings. My neighborhood has many kinds of homes. \n\nPeople of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But, I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open space before. She was surprised by all the corn fields. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she knew more about me and where I came from. \n\nWe drove on a small road. We passed a quarry full of water. Just past it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a large yard. Everyone takes care of their yard. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars that shine in the sun. \n\nAs we continued, we saw my grey stucco home. My Korean neighbor was outside with a smile. He spent the day mowing his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a good person with a special past. He used to be a doctor. \n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese ran from our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream. It feeds into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes, you hear a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge is an untouched area. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. \n\nThe winters in my town are very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. In our wonderland, we pretended and played. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You move from farmland to small cities for visitors. There are no big city stores like malls, Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive everywhere you need to go. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you look, there is a beach to enjoy. \n\nMy neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old and some are being fixed up. Most homes have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Many houses have older metal siding. Houses are many different colors. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. People work hard for a living and raise families. Kids play in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and skate. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. People wave to each other and smile. \n\nLawns are kept nice. No one has leaves from fall. Grass is green and cut. If there are plants and bushes, they are trimmed. The neighborhood may not look special, but it feels like a good place for families. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It shows what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. \n\nNearby is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields close by. You can hear the announcers call the game. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. \n\nYou can walk to buy ice cream from a local shop. You can also go downtown from the neighborhood. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association in my neighborhood. Because of this, the homes are well-kept. Front yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some yards have small trees. All houses have two-car garages. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one-story, but some are two-story. Mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to open our mailboxes. There are also two lockers for packages. This is due to the homeowner's association. My house is on the edge of the city. So, the area is part rural, part suburb. We have a lot of land. There are pools for people who live here. They are clean and gated. There are trails for walking dogs or walking alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place, and people care for each other. There are some middle-aged and young workers too. The city is large by population but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is fine. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to important places. There, I find many stores. We have high-end groceries with organic food. We also have bargain stores with a few items and low costs. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you want.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a show about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over the years. You start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. You notice smells less when you are older. You might start to smoke, or maybe you just get used to how things are. The flea market smell is strong. The smell of being an adult is dusty papers on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you wash it. Here, there are 3 thrift stores you can walk to. If you start at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. Even with many cars and people, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a large online trade and delivery company. It is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone follows their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and free, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we are less strangers and more like a group of friends. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave them food; they do the same for me. I bring them mail, and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy seeing me too. I live in a big, modern area, but people like my neighbors make me feel like my life is good.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My part of town is on the east side. It is not a rich area. Many people here have low income. Most houses are rented or owned by people with little money. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are nice. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit more common than in other parts of town, but not too much. There have been some violent crimes nearby in the last ten years, like shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. Our family has been lucky, with only small things taken from our porch. The town has been hit hard by the \"opioid epidemic,\" like many places in the United States. Many have died from drug overdoses. But there are resources here to help, like rehab centers and training for families of drug users. Despite these problems, my town has good points. My son’s school is great. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is welcoming. He loves it there. The PTO plans many events to get families involved. Over 20% of people in town are poor, so the school gives free meals to all students. No child goes hungry, and fees are kept low. The City Council has improved the town’s look by fixing roads, adding plants, and fixing parks. Sadly, these changes are mostly in the center and west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often ignored, which bothers us. Still, I like living here. People are friendly, schools are good, and there are enough stores for us. Our home may not be worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot think of living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from an old theater. A block down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. During weekends in June and July, there is often a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete, with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near a family center where they can wash. \n\nI love my city not for the old buildings or their beauty. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. Even now, people tell stories about those days. They remember when the government tried to clean the streets. People work hard to keep it clean. They still care about their city and block. People say that if you are white, you should not walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is from the old days. Maybe I am dark enough to not look all white, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city meant to be a cultural mix. But I know Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are kind and help each other. Laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone. People tell me I am beautiful and valuable, even on the greyest nights.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have good memories. Most people who lived here when I came are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but the good memories are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are young and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park now makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food is popular, and there are many pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian-owned store for Indian food. \n\nI like my neighborhood. I feel grateful when I hear stories about bad neighbors on social media or the news.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar got a new name and is more costly, but it has good service and drinks. Most people there are nice. They are either college students or have lower incomes since the apartments are not costly. There are many children around because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I think is funny and almost rude. The buildings near me look old but might have new interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I do not like them. The construction was not good. They are built cheaply, but rent is high because they are near the campus. I think that is unfair. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which I hear is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, and grass on the sides, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut some trees down, leaving stumps. But there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my place are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is behind and not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment there, but I cannot blame just them. There are problems across from me too. Despite this, I like where I live. I can afford it, and useful places are nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex houses on a cul-de-sac. They are spread out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. We often stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk while children play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern, busy world. It is like going back in time. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nBut this season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado sirens, so we went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog did not like the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail on the ground. After the storm, the road steamed because the temperature changed. It went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sky cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera. I took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They loved them, and so did I. The streets were quiet for another hour until people came home after the storm. Then life went back to normal with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly neighborhood for me, who just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the way people speak here with a southern accent. \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments inside are different. Some are small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog sing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm you can hear in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was very sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. So, we moved to a better place with good housing and a nice high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They live next to us. They are nice people, and I see them as family in some ways. I appreciate them a lot. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I enjoyed it. I look forward to having a good life in the future. At the wedding, I caught the strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers. We danced all night, and I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I explore it more with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I bring sticks from home depot to practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. There is a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. These are the ones that stand out to me. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not different from other towns in South Carolina, but it helps agriculture a lot. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on its welcome sign. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are usually set back from the road, with fields in front for animals or crops. In the main town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores are. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town. Many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A friendly woman runs it. The store has been in Johnston for many years. They have two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are away from the main town. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but the town is making a 2.5-acre recreation area for families and visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town and very small. You could pass it quickly without noticing.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. We have more cars on the street than I like. But it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs at home. In winter, we sled down a hill. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people come and go all day. We know the cars people drive. When we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We stay at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us, my wife and I, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People here know us well too. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The barbecue smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees because the area was once a forest. There is a lot of shade but also many leaves in the Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows that Fall is here. Winter has been mild lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only when someone knocks, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other things. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors from other places. We see many cars parked then. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt here. People who have not lived here might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a lawn, that person is spending much money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Many places are changing like this. Most of the time, people are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I live near kind old people. Stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you have to travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. The main jobs here are in construction. This city is still not very developed. There are many open spaces to build. That scares me because I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The high desert climate and land create ecosystems that need protection. These are home to many types of wildlife. People here should learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains. You can also take winter sports lessons there. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These show the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Many people have their own homes, but my place is not the same. I call the college campus where I live my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around us is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.  \n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Usually, there are 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms and often house alumni. There are only a few of these houses. The dorm rooms are the most common. They house many students, with two people sharing a room.  \n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments.  \n\nNext, we have stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores include dining places and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores. You can find everything you need here! The park is a clean and safe place for everyone. People in my neighborhood keep it that way.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downward, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be a bit unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines, and repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high up on the hill, with big glass windows on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines, and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you see sunlight through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. You often see them in lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have hunted most of them away. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores here, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will find it easy to get there. Public transportation is simple to use in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy place, so you will feel like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on almost every street. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like to shop at these places because the food is very good, prices are lower, and it is easy to shop there. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets close to each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is a mix of many people, with immigrants and their children. Many big stores here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park with many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in the summer. Parks in New York City have many different people. You will see many kids playing together. There are no big corporate buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses or apartments. The people are nice, but it is noisy. You hear loud music from cars and engines in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here years ago, and packages sometimes get stolen. Also, people do not pick up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that calls itself \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this sign on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. The slogan asks people to remember the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when the city was less known and cheaper. It was a time of creative and unique groups. For others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but they mean it as a good thing.\n\nMany people from California have moved to Portland. New buildings are being built for them. Still, Portland is weird. Weird means accepting things not usually accepted. It does not mean Portland lacks modern comforts or struggles. Like the rest of the country, most of our things come from China. There are many ways of being weird, but Portland has normal things too. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking life too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many in Portland, houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In summer, you can find free boxes on the streets. These are boxes where people put things they no longer need. Often, these boxes hold clothes and books, but they can have anything. You might find a perfect treasure in one of these boxes. This is the magic of a walk through Southeast Portland. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many.\n\nSome people here would not pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They might go to goat yoga or to a Timbers soccer game. Portland is full of people who love many things. We chase our dreams or think about our dreams while at the bar. Portland has a drug problem. This is often a mental health issue. The rain and clouds might make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one knows how to solve it. Many homeless people come here because Portland offers good services. But these services are not enough. People here feel both care and anger about the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they see the sun rise and set. I may forget them when busy with work and life, but they stay strong and calm. When I feel most stressed, they ask to be seen. I look at them and feel peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I first came here for college. The mountains north of campus caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold my heart. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied with lots of coffee. You can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, old brick buildings line the streets. It feels like a busy city. But just past the library, it becomes a quiet small town again. This mix makes the city feel special, like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. Like walking in the park after a night of study or going to a movie downtown. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are good for thinking or crying when life feels hard. I have done this a lot. I watch the turtles, ducks, and bugs and think about my purpose in life. I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses until I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and sky, and I realize I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They seem to speak and give me hope.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a place behind a shopping area. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go past the old Whole Foods and walk behind the hotels, you will find a community. These hotels are mostly empty except in the summer when families visit. \n\nIn this community, there are several apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like pieces of a puzzle. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about those. But the other apartments are different, and most people around here do not know about them. \n\nAcross the street is a small college campus. It is quiet. Students come with coffee in their hands, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers get upset when the traffic is slow on busy days. \n\nThe road meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones. The center has nice chairs on the porch and a fan moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and spin on the grass. Bees move around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. Teenage girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube. \n\nThere is a sushi place in the shopping strip by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store for swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken, all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt store. Teens like to go there. They eat yogurt with toppings, do tricks on skateboards, and vape because they think it is cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a small piece of America. It is a place in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some houses are split into two but still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for many in America. This dream once made people happy, but now it seems to be fading. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we try to hold onto it. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not as well-kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways, and children play as if their world is complete. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It offers hope to young people today and brings back memories for older folks. There are few churches, mostly empty, but basketball courts are still busy. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A.\" It is owned by a Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only when cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations and tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when movies about karate stopped being popular, kids lost interest. Now, it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at low prices. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it. It is a cheap night out without kids. There is one expressway near my town. The exit is in the next town. People wanted an exit for our town. Young people liked this idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would change our town, so they stopped it. A new high school is being built, and we need to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best for my town.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people and places. Homes are spread around the area. Shops and restaurants are nearby. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and popular. They are in malls and on the streets. These streets are close to homes that are usually quiet. There are parks near my home. Many people go there with their children. \n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There are LGBTQ+ groups, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. In other parts of the city, there are more people from different places. There are areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are not far, but traffic makes driving slow. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Most people drive because the city is big. Walking is not common. Parking is hard to find. \n\nThere has been much building in the city. Many new apartment buildings are going up. This city is a popular place to live. But, more people means more traffic. Some people are not happy about this. There are many types of homes. Some are big, others small. There are houses and small apartment buildings. My neighborhood has many kinds of homes. \n\nPeople of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But, I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open space before. She was surprised by all the corn fields. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she knew more about me and where I came from. \n\nWe drove on a small road. We passed a quarry full of water. Just past it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a large yard. Everyone takes care of their yard. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars that shine in the sun. \n\nAs we continued, we saw my grey stucco home. My Korean neighbor was outside with a smile. He spent the day mowing his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a good person with a special past. He used to be a doctor. \n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese ran from our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream. It feeds into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes, you hear a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge is an untouched area. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. \n\nThe winters in my town are very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. In our wonderland, we pretended and played. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You move from farmland to small cities for visitors. There are no big city stores like malls, Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive everywhere you need to go. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you look, there is a beach to enjoy. \n\nMy neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old and some are being fixed up. Most homes have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Many houses have older metal siding. Houses are many different colors. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. People work hard for a living and raise families. Kids play in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and skate. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. People wave to each other and smile. \n\nLawns are kept nice. No one has leaves from fall. Grass is green and cut. If there are plants and bushes, they are trimmed. The neighborhood may not look special, but it feels like a good place for families. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It shows what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. \n\nNearby is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields close by. You can hear the announcers call the game. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. \n\nYou can walk to buy ice cream from a local shop. You can also go downtown from the neighborhood. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association in my neighborhood. Because of this, the homes are well-kept. Front yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some yards have small trees. All houses have two-car garages. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one-story, but some are two-story. Mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to open our mailboxes. There are also two lockers for packages. This is due to the homeowner's association. My house is on the edge of the city. So, the area is part rural, part suburb. We have a lot of land. There are pools for people who live here. They are clean and gated. There are trails for walking dogs or walking alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place, and people care for each other. There are some middle-aged and young workers too. The city is large by population but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is fine. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to important places. There, I find many stores. We have high-end groceries with organic food. We also have bargain stores with a few items and low costs. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you want.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a show about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over the years. You start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. You notice smells less when you are older. You might start to smoke, or maybe you just get used to how things are. The flea market smell is strong. The smell of being an adult is dusty papers on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you wash it. Here, there are 3 thrift stores you can walk to. If you start at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. Even with many cars and people, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a large online trade and delivery company. It is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone follows their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and free, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we are less strangers and more like a group of friends. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave them food; they do the same for me. I bring them mail, and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy seeing me too. I live in a big, modern area, but people like my neighbors make me feel like my life is good.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My part of town is on the east side. It is not a rich area. Many people here have low income. Most houses are rented or owned by people with little money. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are nice. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit more common than in other parts of town, but not too much. There have been some violent crimes nearby in the last ten years, like shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. Our family has been lucky, with only small things taken from our porch. The town has been hit hard by the \"opioid epidemic,\" like many places in the United States. Many have died from drug overdoses. But there are resources here to help, like rehab centers and training for families of drug users. Despite these problems, my town has good points. My son’s school is great. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is welcoming. He loves it there. The PTO plans many events to get families involved. Over 20% of people in town are poor, so the school gives free meals to all students. No child goes hungry, and fees are kept low. The City Council has improved the town’s look by fixing roads, adding plants, and fixing parks. Sadly, these changes are mostly in the center and west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often ignored, which bothers us. Still, I like living here. People are friendly, schools are good, and there are enough stores for us. Our home may not be worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot think of living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from an old theater. A block down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. During weekends in June and July, there is often a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete, with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near a family center where they can wash. \n\nI love my city not for the old buildings or their beauty. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. Even now, people tell stories about those days. They remember when the government tried to clean the streets. People work hard to keep it clean. They still care about their city and block. People say that if you are white, you should not walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is from the old days. Maybe I am dark enough to not look all white, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city meant to be a cultural mix. But I know Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are kind and help each other. Laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone. People tell me I am beautiful and valuable, even on the greyest nights.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have good memories. Most people who lived here when I came are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but the good memories are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are young and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park now makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food is popular, and there are many pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian-owned store for Indian food. \n\nI like my neighborhood. I feel grateful when I hear stories about bad neighbors on social media or the news.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar got a new name and is more costly, but it has good service and drinks. Most people there are nice. They are either college students or have lower incomes since the apartments are not costly. There are many children around because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I think is funny and almost rude. The buildings near me look old but might have new interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I do not like them. The construction was not good. They are built cheaply, but rent is high because they are near the campus. I think that is unfair. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which I hear is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, and grass on the sides, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut some trees down, leaving stumps. But there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my place are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is behind and not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment there, but I cannot blame just them. There are problems across from me too. Despite this, I like where I live. I can afford it, and useful places are nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex houses on a cul-de-sac. They are spread out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. We often stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk while children play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern, busy world. It is like going back in time. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nBut this season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado sirens, so we went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog did not like the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail on the ground. After the storm, the road steamed because the temperature changed. It went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sky cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera. I took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They loved them, and so did I. The streets were quiet for another hour until people came home after the storm. Then life went back to normal with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly neighborhood for me, who just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the way people speak here with a southern accent. \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments inside are different. Some are small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog sing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm you can hear in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was very sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. So, we moved to a better place with good housing and a nice high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They live next to us. They are nice people, and I see them as family in some ways. I appreciate them a lot. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I enjoyed it. I look forward to having a good life in the future. At the wedding, I caught the strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers. We danced all night, and I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I explore it more with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I bring sticks from home depot to practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. There is a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. These are the ones that stand out to me. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not different from other towns in South Carolina, but it helps agriculture a lot. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on its welcome sign. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are usually set back from the road, with fields in front for animals or crops. In the main town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores are. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town. Many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A friendly woman runs it. The store has been in Johnston for many years. They have two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are away from the main town. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but the town is making a 2.5-acre recreation area for families and visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town and very small. You could pass it quickly without noticing.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. We have more cars on the street than I like. But it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs at home. In winter, we sled down a hill. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people come and go all day. We know the cars people drive. When we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We stay at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us, my wife and I, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People here know us well too. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The barbecue smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees because the area was once a forest. There is a lot of shade but also many leaves in the Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows that Fall is here. Winter has been mild lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only when someone knocks, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other things. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors from other places. We see many cars parked then. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt here. People who have not lived here might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a lawn, that person is spending much money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Many places are changing like this. Most of the time, people are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I live near kind old people. Stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you have to travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. The main jobs here are in construction. This city is still not very developed. There are many open spaces to build. That scares me because I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The high desert climate and land create ecosystems that need protection. These are home to many types of wildlife. People here should learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains. You can also take winter sports lessons there. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These show the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Many people have their own homes, but my place is not the same. I call the college campus where I live my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around us is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.  \n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Usually, there are 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms and often house alumni. There are only a few of these houses. The dorm rooms are the most common. They house many students, with two people sharing a room.  \n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments.  \n\nNext, we have stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores include dining places and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores. You can find everything you need here! The park is a clean and safe place for everyone. People in my neighborhood keep it that way.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downward, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be a bit unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines, and repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high up on the hill, with big glass windows on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines, and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you see sunlight through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. You often see them in lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have hunted most of them away. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores here, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will find it easy to get there. Public transportation is simple to use in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy place, so you will feel like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on almost every street. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like to shop at these places because the food is very good, prices are lower, and it is easy to shop there. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets close to each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is a mix of many people, with immigrants and their children. Many big stores here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park with many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in the summer. Parks in New York City have many different people. You will see many kids playing together. There are no big corporate buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses or apartments. The people are nice, but it is noisy. You hear loud music from cars and engines in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here years ago, and packages sometimes get stolen. Also, people do not pick up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that calls itself \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this sign on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. The slogan asks people to remember the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when the city was less known and cheaper. It was a time of creative and unique groups. For others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but they mean it as a good thing.\n\nMany people from California have moved to Portland. New buildings are being built for them. Still, Portland is weird. Weird means accepting things not usually accepted. It does not mean Portland lacks modern comforts or struggles. Like the rest of the country, most of our things come from China. There are many ways of being weird, but Portland has normal things too. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking life too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many in Portland, houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In summer, you can find free boxes on the streets. These are boxes where people put things they no longer need. Often, these boxes hold clothes and books, but they can have anything. You might find a perfect treasure in one of these boxes. This is the magic of a walk through Southeast Portland. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many.\n\nSome people here would not pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They might go to goat yoga or to a Timbers soccer game. Portland is full of people who love many things. We chase our dreams or think about our dreams while at the bar. Portland has a drug problem. This is often a mental health issue. The rain and clouds might make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one knows how to solve it. Many homeless people come here because Portland offers good services. But these services are not enough. People here feel both care and anger about the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they see the sun rise and set. I may forget them when busy with work and life, but they stay strong and calm. When I feel most stressed, they ask to be seen. I look at them and feel peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I first came here for college. The mountains north of campus caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold my heart. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied with lots of coffee. You can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, old brick buildings line the streets. It feels like a busy city. But just past the library, it becomes a quiet small town again. This mix makes the city feel special, like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. Like walking in the park after a night of study or going to a movie downtown. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are good for thinking or crying when life feels hard. I have done this a lot. I watch the turtles, ducks, and bugs and think about my purpose in life. I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses until I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and sky, and I realize I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They seem to speak and give me hope.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a place behind a shopping area. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go past the old Whole Foods and walk behind the hotels, you will find a community. These hotels are mostly empty except in the summer when families visit. \n\nIn this community, there are several apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like pieces of a puzzle. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about those. But the other apartments are different, and most people around here do not know about them. \n\nAcross the street is a small college campus. It is quiet. Students come with coffee in their hands, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers get upset when the traffic is slow on busy days. \n\nThe road meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones. The center has nice chairs on the porch and a fan moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and spin on the grass. Bees move around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. Teenage girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube. \n\nThere is a sushi place in the shopping strip by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store for swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken, all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt store. Teens like to go there. They eat yogurt with toppings, do tricks on skateboards, and vape because they think it is cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a small piece of America. It is a place in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some houses are split into two but still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for many in America. This dream once made people happy, but now it seems to be fading. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we try to hold onto it. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not as well-kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways, and children play as if their world is complete. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It offers hope to young people today and brings back memories for older folks. There are few churches, mostly empty, but basketball courts are still busy. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A.\" It is owned by a Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only when cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations and tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when movies about karate stopped being popular, kids lost interest. Now, it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at low prices. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it. It is a cheap night out without kids. There is one expressway near my town. The exit is in the next town. People wanted an exit for our town. Young people liked this idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would change our town, so they stopped it. A new high school is being built, and we need to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best for my town.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people and places. Homes are spread around the area. Shops and restaurants are nearby. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and popular. They are in malls and on the streets. These streets are close to homes that are usually quiet. There are parks near my home. Many people go there with their children. \n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There are LGBTQ+ groups, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. In other parts of the city, there are more people from different places. There are areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are not far, but traffic makes driving slow. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Most people drive because the city is big. Walking is not common. Parking is hard to find. \n\nThere has been much building in the city. Many new apartment buildings are going up. This city is a popular place to live. But, more people means more traffic. Some people are not happy about this. There are many types of homes. Some are big, others small. There are houses and small apartment buildings. My neighborhood has many kinds of homes. \n\nPeople of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But, I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open space before. She was surprised by all the corn fields. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she knew more about me and where I came from. \n\nWe drove on a small road. We passed a quarry full of water. Just past it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a large yard. Everyone takes care of their yard. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars that shine in the sun. \n\nAs we continued, we saw my grey stucco home. My Korean neighbor was outside with a smile. He spent the day mowing his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a good person with a special past. He used to be a doctor. \n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese ran from our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream. It feeds into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes, you hear a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge is an untouched area. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. \n\nThe winters in my town are very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. In our wonderland, we pretended and played. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You see farmland and small tourist towns. There are no big city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You have to drive to go anywhere. But this is one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My town is near water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach anywhere to dip your toes in. My neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. They are older homes, some updated and remodeled. Most homes have basements that you can see from the road. Many houses have older aluminum siding. Houses come in every color you can think of around my house. Most houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. These houses show Middle America. Hard-working people live here. They work to make a living and are raising families or have raised families. You will see kids running in the streets. You will see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. You see someone grilling outside and wave. Or see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns look good. Nobody has leaves piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a beautiful neighborhood with nice homes, but you think this is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It is average-looking but special because it is a safe place at the end of the day. The county sheriff’s department and jail are close by. The health department is next to that. The city recycling center is down the road. People use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear announcers keeping score and calling player names. Our small town airport is next to that. You can hear small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local place. You can make it downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group keeps the houses looking nice. The houses all look alike. They have small front yards. The yards have grass, stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. The roads are smooth and have no holes. Most houses have one floor, but some have two floors. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is one place with many mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to open our mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages. The homeowner's group likes things to look the same. My house is at the edge of the city. My neighborhood is a little bit country and a little bit suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools for people to use. The pools are clean and have gates. There are walking paths too. You can walk your dog or take a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. You can run in the neighborhood. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People watch out for each other. Some middle-aged and young people live here too. The city is big but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. There is one mall. It is not large, but it is enough. I drive 15 minutes to reach stores. There are many stores to choose from. We have fancy grocery stores with organic food. We also have cheap stores with few items and little staff. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and paths. We are not close to stores, but we can drive to any big store we like.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing people. It was a surprise. Almost every apartment here costs over a thousand dollars a month. I never heard that story before, and my friends had not either. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep. Things are costly, but we have learned to save money over the years. We start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and old clothes. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to it. But the flea market smell is always there. The smell of being an adult is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores you can walk to. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. They say it is a growing city. It hosts one of the largest online companies for shopping and delivery, but it still has growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals, and people do not ask a lot from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, it feels less like an apartment of strangers and more like a community of friends. We help each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help when we can. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they do the same for me. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a large, modern place, but my neighbors make it feel like I did not ruin my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Housing is cheap, and many people rent or own homes here. But the area is nice. The people are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit higher here, but not bad. In the past ten years, some violent crimes happened near my home. There were a few shootings and at least one killing. Last year, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Our family has not been much affected by crime. Sometimes things disappear from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.  \n  \nThe town has been hurt by the opioid problem that affects many places in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are help centers in town. There are places for addiction treatment and Narcan training for families and friends.  \n  \nDespite these problems, the town has good things too. My son’s school is very good. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but is not bullied. The school has a positive feel, and he loves it there. The PTO plans many events for families. Over 20% of the town's people are poor, so the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is hungry. Costs for school things are low.  \n  \nThe City Council has improved the town. They have fixed roads, planted flowers, and fixed parks. Most of these changes are in the center and west side of town. This is where the shops and most traffic are. The east side is often left out, which bothers people here.  \n  \nOverall, I like living here. The people are nice, the schools are good, and there are enough stores for what we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice and enough for us. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with old buildings around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. Down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, a line of people waits to get in. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. Concrete surrounds the park, with many steps in the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents in rows on the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. The heavy rain in mid-winter makes it hard to stay warm. They put their tents close together in the center of town to stay warmer. They are also close to the family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city is not just the beauty of old buildings and the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop was once known for gang violence on the West Coast. People still tell stories about government officials cleaning the streets. The people do not forget. They pass these stories to new people like me. The people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and block. Some say if you are white, do not walk on the Hill after dark. I think this warning is from the past. Maybe I look just dark enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city that should be a mix of cultures. But for me, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People have offered me a jacket more often than trying to rob me. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when I had nowhere to go. It is a place where I sat alone on a grey night, and someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I remember them. Most people who were here when I moved are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. On weekends or when it is warm, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park a few minutes away. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other people. I also had a bad memory there when I hurt my nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and like swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park also makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. In a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian places. Many people use GrubHub or DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food is popular here, like in many suburban areas. There are many pizza places too. The stores here have all you need. There are dry cleaners close by. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Jewel-Osco is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse. There is an Indian-owned store for Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I read on social media and see on the news that some people have problems with neighbors. I am thankful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too costly. One bar has a new name and is more costly, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are either college students or have low income, because the apartments are not costly. Many children live nearby because there is a school close to my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. The buildings around me look old, but inside they might be new. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them because they are not well built. They are cheap to build but the rent is high. This is because they are near the campus. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave a lot. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. The city gave money to fix the road, so now there is a nice sidewalk and grass. This makes the area nicer. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my apartment is another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and most buildings look old. There are many trees, which might hide the old buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But there is also crime across my street. There are many people who move a lot. I like where I live. I can pay for it, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops. This makes it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has houses on a quiet street. They look like separate homes but are really two homes together. Each house is painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people here are friends. We often stand and talk at the end of a driveway while the kids play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice and old-fashioned in our busy world. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds.\n\nThis season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, tornado sirens went off, and we had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking because of the strange noise. The only sound outside was hail hitting the ground. After the storm, steam rose from the road because the temperature changed fast from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. I looked up and saw the sun with rain, and a double rainbow appeared. I ran to get my camera and took pictures to share with friends and family online. They were amazed, and so was I. The street stayed quiet for an hour until people returned home after the storm. Then, things went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked.\n\nI have just moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here with a southern accent. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are very small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, though it is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, I hear a big frog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. We even hear a donkey from a nearby farm in the evening. I feel lucky to live in this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I felt sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with a good high school. It was not a \"ghetto\" neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made new friends and some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next to us. They are nice people. I almost see them as family, and I appreciate them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I hope to have a wedding like that someday. I caught the garter when Ms. Veda, Mr. Glen's wife, threw it, but I did not catch the flowers. We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it. I have gone out only with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. Sometimes I go to the park to enjoy nature, which calms me. It gives me peace. I practice my balance with sticks I bought from the store and use my wooden sword if I can. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a while, but it is nice to have them if I want to play again. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard and had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not very different from other towns in South Carolina, but it has an important role in farming. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this and shows it on the welcome sign. Most of the area is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main part of town are far apart. Most houses have two stories and metal roofs to keep cool in summer or gray shingles. These houses are often not near the road, allowing the front fields for animals or crops. In the center of town, there is one stop light at a four-way crossing. This is where the only stores in town are. You can get food quickly at three places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese family restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed recently. There is a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small but costly grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance or IGA. It is the only grocery store in town, but many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many daily items and is busy from opening to closing. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been here many years and hires two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer care, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's and a veterinary office are away from the main town area. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. Students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks in town, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being made for families and to bring visitors. There is not much to do here. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, places to hang out, playgrounds, pet-walking areas, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town, so small you might pass by without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in the south of Tennessee. Our street connects two state roads, so we have more cars than I want, but it is still a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people who live here. People do yard work and other small jobs each day. In winter, we sled on a hill near the street. Our house is at the front corner, so we see everyone come and go. We know the cars people drive. When we see a car we do not know, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen, and me. People know us well. We play outside, even in the rain. We grill on our back deck sometimes. The smell of barbecue is nice. Someone is always cutting grass, and we hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. We have many trees since this was a wooded area. There is much shade, but also many leaves in Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. Lately, we have not had much Winter, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we do not use the front door much. I work on my truck and other things in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors, so there are more cars. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not know how it feels to always see brown. When you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot on water. In the 90s, homes were far apart here. Now there are many new homes. This place looks more like a city every day. Most places change this way. People here are friendly. But, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I am surrounded by nice, older people. It is a nice neighborhood. The stores here are chain stores like Food for Less. If you want upscale stores, you must travel. I do not see Whole Foods or similar stores here. Many jobs here are in construction. This is because there is still much space to build on. I like it as it is and do not want to go back to a big city. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. What I like about my home are the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has a special climate and land. It is home to many animals. People here should learn about the animals to live together well. My family has adapted to the wildlife. I have three children who love lizards and bugs. They are outside trying to catch them now. We have some attractions. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit to join the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun and full of activities. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has specimens, Native American items, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of a neighborhood as a place with houses and families. But my situation is not the same. I see my college campus as my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a regular neighborhood in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let me talk about the \"houses\" first. There are three types of housing here: apartments, regular houses, and dormitories. \n\nIn the apartments, there are 2 to 4 people in each room. Each building has about 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. \n\nThe regular houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They usually have 2 to 4 bedrooms and are often rented by alumni. There are only a few of these houses because they are less efficient. \n\nThe dormitories are the most common. They house hundreds of students. Usually, two people share a room, but there are some exceptions. \n\nNow, let me talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from different cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the regular houses. New students stay in dormitories. Older students stay in apartments. \n\nThe stores and parks are next. My school has many stores and one park. The stores offer food and have a unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. \n\nThe park is a place for everyone in the neighborhood. It is clean and safe because people take care of it.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in a few places and feels unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires around the block look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other debris often hit the power lines. The constant repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy more often than not, so you mostly see the sunlight through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I went to use it, it was green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There are not many children around where I live, though there is a school only a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older and retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some are large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love them and have chased most of them away from our neighborhood. We also see birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows chase it off. There are no stores around, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the opposite shore clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, it is easy to get there. Public transportation is very good and many people in New York City use it. Bensonhurt is an urban area, so it feels like New York City. When you are there, you will see many Asian stores. In the last 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurt. Because of this, you can find an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to reach. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurt is not only Asian. It is very mixed with people from many places. Many big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park with ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is very mixed with many different people. In this area, there are not many big office buildings. There are co-ops and apartment buildings. Most homes are two-family houses. People here are nice but can be loud. You will hear cars with loud music or cars going fast. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might meet people who cause trouble, like bullies and thieves. I was bullied here in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there was package stealing. Package theft happens here. Also, people do not always clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on your way to places like the train station or supermarket. It bothers me to see dog waste on the ground. Watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see it on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. Some people see this slogan as a call to remember Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. Back then, Portland was less famous and less costly. It was a place with creative and unique subcultures. Others see it as an invitation to come to Portland, where being called weird is a good thing. Even with many people moving from California and new buildings for them, Portland stays weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it does mean accepting unusual things. Weird does not mean we lack modern things or modern battles. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our stuff from China. There are many ways to be weird, or not normal, but Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in many Portland neighborhoods, there are colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes in summer. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone does not need anymore, but they can also be bags or plastic boxes. These boxes can have something special, a perfect treasure for someone passing by. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical chance of finding something in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is about. That is what Portland is about to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many. Some people here would never pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people might go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or attend Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many different things. Portland is full of people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. This problem often links to mental health issues, and the long rainy season and gray skies make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness issue, and no one seems to have a solution. The homeless come for Portland's social services, which are better than in most places, but still not enough. People who are not homeless feel both caring and dislike for the homeless. In this way, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set. I may forget them. I may be busy with work and life. Yet, they stay. They do not change. When I am most stressed, I look at them. They give me peace. They give me strength. I moved here for college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I loved. The university has nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special to me. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied. You can walk or take the bus to downtown. There, old bricks line the streets. The town feels busy like a city. Yet, it is still quiet. Past the library, it is peaceful again. This city feels full of wonder. It asks to be explored. I have many good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. I ran to the theater to watch a movie. But there are also hard memories. The ponds are good for thinking. I cried there at two in the morning. I watched turtles, ducks, and bugs. I thought about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond and park. I went to the main street. The sun shone on the palm trees. The sky was bright. I looked up at the sunrise. I was walking north. The mountains were there. They touched the sky. They made me feel strong.",
            "At first, you might not notice this place. It is a living area behind a row of stores. You might not think people live there. But if you walk behind the old Whole Foods and past the hotels that are busy in summer, you will find a busy area. There are many apartment buildings. They sit next to each other like Russian dolls set in a line. \n\nThe first apartments have a bad reputation, so let us not talk much about those. But the apartments next to them are different. Few in the area know about them. Across from these buildings is a small campus of a community college. It is a quiet place. Students come in the morning with coffee to start their day. The gates open for them slowly. People driving by get upset when the traffic slows down.\n\nThe road here meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has nice furniture outside and a fan that turns in the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and roll on the grass. Bees fly among the flowers. Old people walk their dogs. They frown at teenagers on skateboards but smile at girls talking by the playground. \n\nNext to the park, there is a strip mall. It has a sushi place with cheap food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can buy things for your pool, get your nails done, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens gather. They eat yogurt and do tricks on skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is in the quiet south where not much changes, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. Some homes are split into two parts, but still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. It looks like most of the other houses. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to welcome the people of this country. Now it is moving away. But my neighborhood and many others are still here. They tell us and visitors that the dream is still alive. We hold onto it as best we can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The small yards are not as well kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in every driveway. Kids still play like the world around them is all that exists. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It brings hope for the future in young people. It also brings memories to older people. There are a few churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. All the homes look different but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people living here are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in the street and stop when cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have been here for many years. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not go there much. Older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one expressway that goes through my town. But the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. Young people liked the idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would ruin the town. They convinced the city council to say no. A new high school is being built. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are spread out between business areas. There are many businesses here. Some are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are always new restaurants and stores to try. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small boutiques. These small stores are in malls and also along the streets. The streets are close to the homes. There are also parks nearby. People go to these parks with their children.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are very different from each other. We have a strong LGBTQ+ community. There is an Orthodox Jewish community. We also have refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different races and places. They often have their own communities. We have places called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These are just a few miles away. But a few miles can be a long drive. A 10-mile drive can take two hours because of traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in my city. The city is big, and people do not like to walk to places. We have some of the worst traffic in the world. It is hard to find parking spaces.\n\nThere is also a lot of building work happening. More large apartment buildings are being made. The city is popular, but current residents do not like the idea of more people moving in. They worry about more cars on the roads. There are many kinds of homes in my city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, smaller apartments, and condos. Some homes are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood too. We have different housing options. People here are of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But I remember playing outside with friends when I was young. My friends were my next-door neighbor and others from the neighborhood. We were all about the same age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the fields of corn. \"This is it!\" I said. She was shocked by the open land. She came from a town where the store was a short walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She learned more about me then. We drove on a two-lane road. We passed a quarry filled with water. Next is the small area where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their land. In spring, there are many flowers. Trees change with the seasons. Driveways have shiny Mercedes Benz cars after a wash. As we go to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is outside. He smiles and mows his lawn. He sings while working. People like him. He was a doctor before. Now he is older. His mower is a John Deere. You reach my home. Geese are in the yard, chased by our Terrier. In the back, a small stream leads to the quarry. You hear frogs, the stream, and cows. Across a wooden bridge is a wild place with trees and flowers. I spent my childhood here. We built forts and chased animals. Winters here are cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to bare. Snow makes a wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen are in the yard. My sister and I fought with snowballs. We built forts for our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids, happy and free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You see farmland and small tourist towns. There are no big city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You have to drive to go anywhere. But this is one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My town is near water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach anywhere to dip your toes in. My neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. They are older homes, some updated and remodeled. Most homes have basements that you can see from the road. Many houses have older aluminum siding. Houses come in every color you can think of around my house. Most houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. These houses show Middle America. Hard-working people live here. They work to make a living and are raising families or have raised families. You will see kids running in the streets. You will see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. You see someone grilling outside and wave. Or see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns look good. Nobody has leaves piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a beautiful neighborhood with nice homes, but you think this is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It is average-looking but special because it is a safe place at the end of the day. The county sheriff’s department and jail are close by. The health department is next to that. The city recycling center is down the road. People use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear announcers keeping score and calling player names. Our small town airport is next to that. You can hear small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local place. You can make it downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group keeps the houses looking nice. The houses all look alike. They have small front yards. The yards have grass, stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. The roads are smooth and have no holes. Most houses have one floor, but some have two floors. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is one place with many mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to open our mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages. The homeowner's group likes things to look the same. My house is at the edge of the city. My neighborhood is a little bit country and a little bit suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools for people to use. The pools are clean and have gates. There are walking paths too. You can walk your dog or take a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. You can run in the neighborhood. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People watch out for each other. Some middle-aged and young people live here too. The city is big but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. There is one mall. It is not large, but it is enough. I drive 15 minutes to reach stores. There are many stores to choose from. We have fancy grocery stores with organic food. We also have cheap stores with few items and little staff. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and paths. We are not close to stores, but we can drive to any big store we like.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing people. It was a surprise. Almost every apartment here costs over a thousand dollars a month. I never heard that story before, and my friends had not either. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep. Things are costly, but we have learned to save money over the years. We start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and old clothes. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to it. But the flea market smell is always there. The smell of being an adult is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores you can walk to. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. They say it is a growing city. It hosts one of the largest online companies for shopping and delivery, but it still has growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals, and people do not ask a lot from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, it feels less like an apartment of strangers and more like a community of friends. We help each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help when we can. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they do the same for me. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a large, modern place, but my neighbors make it feel like I did not ruin my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Housing is cheap, and many people rent or own homes here. But the area is nice. The people are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit higher here, but not bad. In the past ten years, some violent crimes happened near my home. There were a few shootings and at least one killing. Last year, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Our family has not been much affected by crime. Sometimes things disappear from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.  \n  \nThe town has been hurt by the opioid problem that affects many places in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are help centers in town. There are places for addiction treatment and Narcan training for families and friends.  \n  \nDespite these problems, the town has good things too. My son’s school is very good. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but is not bullied. The school has a positive feel, and he loves it there. The PTO plans many events for families. Over 20% of the town's people are poor, so the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is hungry. Costs for school things are low.  \n  \nThe City Council has improved the town. They have fixed roads, planted flowers, and fixed parks. Most of these changes are in the center and west side of town. This is where the shops and most traffic are. The east side is often left out, which bothers people here.  \n  \nOverall, I like living here. The people are nice, the schools are good, and there are enough stores for what we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice and enough for us. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with old buildings around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. Down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, a line of people waits to get in. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. Concrete surrounds the park, with many steps in the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents in rows on the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. The heavy rain in mid-winter makes it hard to stay warm. They put their tents close together in the center of town to stay warmer. They are also close to the family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city is not just the beauty of old buildings and the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop was once known for gang violence on the West Coast. People still tell stories about government officials cleaning the streets. The people do not forget. They pass these stories to new people like me. The people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and block. Some say if you are white, do not walk on the Hill after dark. I think this warning is from the past. Maybe I look just dark enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city that should be a mix of cultures. But for me, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People have offered me a jacket more often than trying to rob me. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when I had nowhere to go. It is a place where I sat alone on a grey night, and someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I remember them. Most people who were here when I moved are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. On weekends or when it is warm, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park a few minutes away. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other people. I also had a bad memory there when I hurt my nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and like swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park also makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. In a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian places. Many people use GrubHub or DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food is popular here, like in many suburban areas. There are many pizza places too. The stores here have all you need. There are dry cleaners close by. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Jewel-Osco is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse. There is an Indian-owned store for Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I read on social media and see on the news that some people have problems with neighbors. I am thankful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too costly. One bar has a new name and is more costly, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are either college students or have low income, because the apartments are not costly. Many children live nearby because there is a school close to my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. The buildings around me look old, but inside they might be new. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them because they are not well built. They are cheap to build but the rent is high. This is because they are near the campus. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave a lot. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. The city gave money to fix the road, so now there is a nice sidewalk and grass. This makes the area nicer. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my apartment is another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and most buildings look old. There are many trees, which might hide the old buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But there is also crime across my street. There are many people who move a lot. I like where I live. I can pay for it, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops. This makes it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has houses on a quiet street. They look like separate homes but are really two homes together. Each house is painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people here are friends. We often stand and talk at the end of a driveway while the kids play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice and old-fashioned in our busy world. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds.\n\nThis season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, tornado sirens went off, and we had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking because of the strange noise. The only sound outside was hail hitting the ground. After the storm, steam rose from the road because the temperature changed fast from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. I looked up and saw the sun with rain, and a double rainbow appeared. I ran to get my camera and took pictures to share with friends and family online. They were amazed, and so was I. The street stayed quiet for an hour until people returned home after the storm. Then, things went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked.\n\nI have just moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here with a southern accent. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are very small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, though it is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, I hear a big frog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. We even hear a donkey from a nearby farm in the evening. I feel lucky to live in this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I felt sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with a good high school. It was not a \"ghetto\" neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made new friends and some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next to us. They are nice people. I almost see them as family, and I appreciate them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I hope to have a wedding like that someday. I caught the garter when Ms. Veda, Mr. Glen's wife, threw it, but I did not catch the flowers. We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it. I have gone out only with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. Sometimes I go to the park to enjoy nature, which calms me. It gives me peace. I practice my balance with sticks I bought from the store and use my wooden sword if I can. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a while, but it is nice to have them if I want to play again. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard and had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not very different from other towns in South Carolina, but it has an important role in farming. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this and shows it on the welcome sign. Most of the area is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main part of town are far apart. Most houses have two stories and metal roofs to keep cool in summer or gray shingles. These houses are often not near the road, allowing the front fields for animals or crops. In the center of town, there is one stop light at a four-way crossing. This is where the only stores in town are. You can get food quickly at three places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese family restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed recently. There is a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small but costly grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance or IGA. It is the only grocery store in town, but many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many daily items and is busy from opening to closing. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been here many years and hires two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer care, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's and a veterinary office are away from the main town area. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. Students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks in town, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being made for families and to bring visitors. There is not much to do here. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, places to hang out, playgrounds, pet-walking areas, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town, so small you might pass by without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in the south of Tennessee. Our street connects two state roads, so we have more cars than I want, but it is still a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people who live here. People do yard work and other small jobs each day. In winter, we sled on a hill near the street. Our house is at the front corner, so we see everyone come and go. We know the cars people drive. When we see a car we do not know, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen, and me. People know us well. We play outside, even in the rain. We grill on our back deck sometimes. The smell of barbecue is nice. Someone is always cutting grass, and we hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. We have many trees since this was a wooded area. There is much shade, but also many leaves in Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. Lately, we have not had much Winter, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we do not use the front door much. I work on my truck and other things in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors, so there are more cars. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not know how it feels to always see brown. When you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot on water. In the 90s, homes were far apart here. Now there are many new homes. This place looks more like a city every day. Most places change this way. People here are friendly. But, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I am surrounded by nice, older people. It is a nice neighborhood. The stores here are chain stores like Food for Less. If you want upscale stores, you must travel. I do not see Whole Foods or similar stores here. Many jobs here are in construction. This is because there is still much space to build on. I like it as it is and do not want to go back to a big city. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. What I like about my home are the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has a special climate and land. It is home to many animals. People here should learn about the animals to live together well. My family has adapted to the wildlife. I have three children who love lizards and bugs. They are outside trying to catch them now. We have some attractions. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit to join the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun and full of activities. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has specimens, Native American items, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of a neighborhood as a place with houses and families. But my situation is not the same. I see my college campus as my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a regular neighborhood in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let me talk about the \"houses\" first. There are three types of housing here: apartments, regular houses, and dormitories. \n\nIn the apartments, there are 2 to 4 people in each room. Each building has about 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. \n\nThe regular houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They usually have 2 to 4 bedrooms and are often rented by alumni. There are only a few of these houses because they are less efficient. \n\nThe dormitories are the most common. They house hundreds of students. Usually, two people share a room, but there are some exceptions. \n\nNow, let me talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from different cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the regular houses. New students stay in dormitories. Older students stay in apartments. \n\nThe stores and parks are next. My school has many stores and one park. The stores offer food and have a unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. \n\nThe park is a place for everyone in the neighborhood. It is clean and safe because people take care of it.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in a few places and feels unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires around the block look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other debris often hit the power lines. The constant repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy more often than not, so you mostly see the sunlight through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I went to use it, it was green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There are not many children around where I live, though there is a school only a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older and retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some are large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love them and have chased most of them away from our neighborhood. We also see birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows chase it off. There are no stores around, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the opposite shore clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, it is easy to get there. Public transportation is very good and many people in New York City use it. Bensonhurt is an urban area, so it feels like New York City. When you are there, you will see many Asian stores. In the last 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurt. Because of this, you can find an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to reach. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurt is not only Asian. It is very mixed with people from many places. Many big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park with ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is very mixed with many different people. In this area, there are not many big office buildings. There are co-ops and apartment buildings. Most homes are two-family houses. People here are nice but can be loud. You will hear cars with loud music or cars going fast. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might meet people who cause trouble, like bullies and thieves. I was bullied here in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there was package stealing. Package theft happens here. Also, people do not always clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on your way to places like the train station or supermarket. It bothers me to see dog waste on the ground. Watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see it on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. Some people see this slogan as a call to remember Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. Back then, Portland was less famous and less costly. It was a place with creative and unique subcultures. Others see it as an invitation to come to Portland, where being called weird is a good thing. Even with many people moving from California and new buildings for them, Portland stays weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it does mean accepting unusual things. Weird does not mean we lack modern things or modern battles. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our stuff from China. There are many ways to be weird, or not normal, but Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in many Portland neighborhoods, there are colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes in summer. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone does not need anymore, but they can also be bags or plastic boxes. These boxes can have something special, a perfect treasure for someone passing by. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical chance of finding something in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is about. That is what Portland is about to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many. Some people here would never pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people might go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or attend Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many different things. Portland is full of people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. This problem often links to mental health issues, and the long rainy season and gray skies make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness issue, and no one seems to have a solution. The homeless come for Portland's social services, which are better than in most places, but still not enough. People who are not homeless feel both caring and dislike for the homeless. In this way, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set. I may forget them. I may be busy with work and life. Yet, they stay. They do not change. When I am most stressed, I look at them. They give me peace. They give me strength. I moved here for college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I loved. The university has nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special to me. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied. You can walk or take the bus to downtown. There, old bricks line the streets. The town feels busy like a city. Yet, it is still quiet. Past the library, it is peaceful again. This city feels full of wonder. It asks to be explored. I have many good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. I ran to the theater to watch a movie. But there are also hard memories. The ponds are good for thinking. I cried there at two in the morning. I watched turtles, ducks, and bugs. I thought about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond and park. I went to the main street. The sun shone on the palm trees. The sky was bright. I looked up at the sunrise. I was walking north. The mountains were there. They touched the sky. They made me feel strong.",
            "At first, you might not notice this place. It is a living area behind a row of stores. You might not think people live there. But if you walk behind the old Whole Foods and past the hotels that are busy in summer, you will find a busy area. There are many apartment buildings. They sit next to each other like Russian dolls set in a line. \n\nThe first apartments have a bad reputation, so let us not talk much about those. But the apartments next to them are different. Few in the area know about them. Across from these buildings is a small campus of a community college. It is a quiet place. Students come in the morning with coffee to start their day. The gates open for them slowly. People driving by get upset when the traffic slows down.\n\nThe road here meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has nice furniture outside and a fan that turns in the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and roll on the grass. Bees fly among the flowers. Old people walk their dogs. They frown at teenagers on skateboards but smile at girls talking by the playground. \n\nNext to the park, there is a strip mall. It has a sushi place with cheap food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can buy things for your pool, get your nails done, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens gather. They eat yogurt and do tricks on skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is in the quiet south where not much changes, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. Some homes are split into two parts, but still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. It looks like most of the other houses. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to welcome the people of this country. Now it is moving away. But my neighborhood and many others are still here. They tell us and visitors that the dream is still alive. We hold onto it as best we can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The small yards are not as well kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in every driveway. Kids still play like the world around them is all that exists. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It brings hope for the future in young people. It also brings memories to older people. There are a few churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. All the homes look different but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people living here are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in the street and stop when cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have been here for many years. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not go there much. Older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one expressway that goes through my town. But the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. Young people liked the idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would ruin the town. They convinced the city council to say no. A new high school is being built. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are spread out between business areas. There are many businesses here. Some are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are always new restaurants and stores to try. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small boutiques. These small stores are in malls and also along the streets. The streets are close to the homes. There are also parks nearby. People go to these parks with their children.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are very different from each other. We have a strong LGBTQ+ community. There is an Orthodox Jewish community. We also have refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different races and places. They often have their own communities. We have places called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These are just a few miles away. But a few miles can be a long drive. A 10-mile drive can take two hours because of traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in my city. The city is big, and people do not like to walk to places. We have some of the worst traffic in the world. It is hard to find parking spaces.\n\nThere is also a lot of building work happening. More large apartment buildings are being made. The city is popular, but current residents do not like the idea of more people moving in. They worry about more cars on the roads. There are many kinds of homes in my city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, smaller apartments, and condos. Some homes are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood too. We have different housing options. People here are of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But I remember playing outside with friends when I was young. My friends were my next-door neighbor and others from the neighborhood. We were all about the same age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the fields of corn. \"This is it!\" I said. She was shocked by the open land. She came from a town where the store was a short walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She learned more about me then. We drove on a two-lane road. We passed a quarry filled with water. Next is the small area where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their land. In spring, there are many flowers. Trees change with the seasons. Driveways have shiny Mercedes Benz cars after a wash. As we go to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is outside. He smiles and mows his lawn. He sings while working. People like him. He was a doctor before. Now he is older. His mower is a John Deere. You reach my home. Geese are in the yard, chased by our Terrier. In the back, a small stream leads to the quarry. You hear frogs, the stream, and cows. Across a wooden bridge is a wild place with trees and flowers. I spent my childhood here. We built forts and chased animals. Winters here are cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to bare. Snow makes a wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen are in the yard. My sister and I fought with snowballs. We built forts for our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids, happy and free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You see farmland and small tourist towns. There are no big city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You have to drive to go anywhere. But this is one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My town is near water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach anywhere to dip your toes in. My neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. They are older homes, some updated and remodeled. Most homes have basements that you can see from the road. Many houses have older aluminum siding. Houses come in every color you can think of around my house. Most houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. These houses show Middle America. Hard-working people live here. They work to make a living and are raising families or have raised families. You will see kids running in the streets. You will see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. You see someone grilling outside and wave. Or see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns look good. Nobody has leaves piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a beautiful neighborhood with nice homes, but you think this is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It is average-looking but special because it is a safe place at the end of the day. The county sheriff’s department and jail are close by. The health department is next to that. The city recycling center is down the road. People use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear announcers keeping score and calling player names. Our small town airport is next to that. You can hear small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local place. You can make it downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group keeps the houses looking nice. The houses all look alike. They have small front yards. The yards have grass, stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. The roads are smooth and have no holes. Most houses have one floor, but some have two floors. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is one place with many mailboxes at the end of the street. We use a key to open our mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages. The homeowner's group likes things to look the same. My house is at the edge of the city. My neighborhood is a little bit country and a little bit suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools for people to use. The pools are clean and have gates. There are walking paths too. You can walk your dog or take a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. You can run in the neighborhood. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People watch out for each other. Some middle-aged and young people live here too. The city is big but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. There is one mall. It is not large, but it is enough. I drive 15 minutes to reach stores. There are many stores to choose from. We have fancy grocery stores with organic food. We also have cheap stores with few items and little staff. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and paths. We are not close to stores, but we can drive to any big store we like.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing people. It was a surprise. Almost every apartment here costs over a thousand dollars a month. I never heard that story before, and my friends had not either. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep. Things are costly, but we have learned to save money over the years. We start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and old clothes. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to it. But the flea market smell is always there. The smell of being an adult is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores you can walk to. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. They say it is a growing city. It hosts one of the largest online companies for shopping and delivery, but it still has growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals, and people do not ask a lot from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, it feels less like an apartment of strangers and more like a community of friends. We help each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help when we can. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they do the same for me. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a large, modern place, but my neighbors make it feel like I did not ruin my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is one of the poorer areas. Housing is cheap, and many people rent or own homes here. But the area is nice. The people are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit higher here, but not bad. In the past ten years, some violent crimes happened near my home. There were a few shootings and at least one killing. Last year, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. Our family has not been much affected by crime. Sometimes things disappear from our porch if we forget to bring them inside.  \n  \nThe town has been hurt by the opioid problem that affects many places in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are help centers in town. There are places for addiction treatment and Narcan training for families and friends.  \n  \nDespite these problems, the town has good things too. My son’s school is very good. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but is not bullied. The school has a positive feel, and he loves it there. The PTO plans many events for families. Over 20% of the town's people are poor, so the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is hungry. Costs for school things are low.  \n  \nThe City Council has improved the town. They have fixed roads, planted flowers, and fixed parks. Most of these changes are in the center and west side of town. This is where the shops and most traffic are. The east side is often left out, which bothers people here.  \n  \nOverall, I like living here. The people are nice, the schools are good, and there are enough stores for what we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice and enough for us. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with old buildings around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. Down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, a line of people waits to get in. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. Concrete surrounds the park, with many steps in the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up tents in rows on the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. The heavy rain in mid-winter makes it hard to stay warm. They put their tents close together in the center of town to stay warmer. They are also close to the family center, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city is not just the beauty of old buildings and the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop was once known for gang violence on the West Coast. People still tell stories about government officials cleaning the streets. The people do not forget. They pass these stories to new people like me. The people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and block. Some say if you are white, do not walk on the Hill after dark. I think this warning is from the past. Maybe I look just dark enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city that should be a mix of cultures. But for me, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People have offered me a jacket more often than trying to rob me. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when I had nowhere to go. It is a place where I sat alone on a grey night, and someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I remember them. Most people who were here when I moved are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has many two-story houses. On weekends or when it is warm, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park a few minutes away. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other people. I also had a bad memory there when I hurt my nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and like swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park also makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. In a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian places. Many people use GrubHub or DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food is popular here, like in many suburban areas. There are many pizza places too. The stores here have all you need. There are dry cleaners close by. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Jewel-Osco is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse. There is an Indian-owned store for Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I read on social media and see on the news that some people have problems with neighbors. I am thankful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too costly. One bar has a new name and is more costly, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are either college students or have low income, because the apartments are not costly. Many children live nearby because there is a school close to my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. The buildings around me look old, but inside they might be new. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them because they are not well built. They are cheap to build but the rent is high. This is because they are near the campus. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave a lot. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. The city gave money to fix the road, so now there is a nice sidewalk and grass. This makes the area nicer. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my apartment is another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and most buildings look old. There are many trees, which might hide the old buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But there is also crime across my street. There are many people who move a lot. I like where I live. I can pay for it, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops. This makes it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has houses on a quiet street. They look like separate homes but are really two homes together. Each house is painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people here are friends. We often stand and talk at the end of a driveway while the kids play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice and old-fashioned in our busy world. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds.\n\nThis season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, tornado sirens went off, and we had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking because of the strange noise. The only sound outside was hail hitting the ground. After the storm, steam rose from the road because the temperature changed fast from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. I looked up and saw the sun with rain, and a double rainbow appeared. I ran to get my camera and took pictures to share with friends and family online. They were amazed, and so was I. The street stayed quiet for an hour until people returned home after the storm. Then, things went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked.\n\nI have just moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here with a southern accent. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone else. But not all apartments are the same inside. Some are very small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, though it is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, I hear a big frog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. We even hear a donkey from a nearby farm in the evening. I feel lucky to live in this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I felt sad. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with a good high school. It was not a \"ghetto\" neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made new friends and some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next to us. They are nice people. I almost see them as family, and I appreciate them. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I hope to have a wedding like that someday. I caught the garter when Ms. Veda, Mr. Glen's wife, threw it, but I did not catch the flowers. We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it. I have gone out only with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. Sometimes I go to the park to enjoy nature, which calms me. It gives me peace. I practice my balance with sticks I bought from the store and use my wooden sword if I can. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a while, but it is nice to have them if I want to play again. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard and had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not very different from other towns in South Carolina, but it has an important role in farming. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this and shows it on the welcome sign. Most of the area is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main part of town are far apart. Most houses have two stories and metal roofs to keep cool in summer or gray shingles. These houses are often not near the road, allowing the front fields for animals or crops. In the center of town, there is one stop light at a four-way crossing. This is where the only stores in town are. You can get food quickly at three places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese family restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed recently. There is a small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small but costly grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance or IGA. It is the only grocery store in town, but many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many daily items and is busy from opening to closing. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been here many years and hires two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer care, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's and a veterinary office are away from the main town area. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. Students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks in town, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being made for families and to bring visitors. There is not much to do here. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, places to hang out, playgrounds, pet-walking areas, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town, so small you might pass by without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in the south of Tennessee. Our street connects two state roads, so we have more cars than I want, but it is still a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people who live here. People do yard work and other small jobs each day. In winter, we sled on a hill near the street. Our house is at the front corner, so we see everyone come and go. We know the cars people drive. When we see a car we do not know, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We work from home, so we are here a lot. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen, and me. People know us well. We play outside, even in the rain. We grill on our back deck sometimes. The smell of barbecue is nice. Someone is always cutting grass, and we hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. We have many trees since this was a wooded area. There is much shade, but also many leaves in Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. Lately, we have not had much Winter, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we do not use the front door much. I work on my truck and other things in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors, so there are more cars. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not know how it feels to always see brown. When you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot on water. In the 90s, homes were far apart here. Now there are many new homes. This place looks more like a city every day. Most places change this way. People here are friendly. But, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I am surrounded by nice, older people. It is a nice neighborhood. The stores here are chain stores like Food for Less. If you want upscale stores, you must travel. I do not see Whole Foods or similar stores here. Many jobs here are in construction. This is because there is still much space to build on. I like it as it is and do not want to go back to a big city. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. What I like about my home are the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has a special climate and land. It is home to many animals. People here should learn about the animals to live together well. My family has adapted to the wildlife. I have three children who love lizards and bugs. They are outside trying to catch them now. We have some attractions. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit to join the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun and full of activities. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has specimens, Native American items, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of a neighborhood as a place with houses and families. But my situation is not the same. I see my college campus as my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a regular neighborhood in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let me talk about the \"houses\" first. There are three types of housing here: apartments, regular houses, and dormitories. \n\nIn the apartments, there are 2 to 4 people in each room. Each building has about 4 to 6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. \n\nThe regular houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They usually have 2 to 4 bedrooms and are often rented by alumni. There are only a few of these houses because they are less efficient. \n\nThe dormitories are the most common. They house hundreds of students. Usually, two people share a room, but there are some exceptions. \n\nNow, let me talk about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from different cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the regular houses. New students stay in dormitories. Older students stay in apartments. \n\nThe stores and parks are next. My school has many stores and one park. The stores offer food and have a unique brand of clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. \n\nThe park is a place for everyone in the neighborhood. It is clean and safe because people take care of it.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in a few places and feels unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires around the block look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other debris often hit the power lines. The constant repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy more often than not, so you mostly see the sunlight through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and when I went to use it, it was green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There are not many children around where I live, though there is a school only a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older and retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some are large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love them and have chased most of them away from our neighborhood. We also see birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows chase it off. There are no stores around, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the opposite shore clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurt in Brooklyn, it is easy to get there. Public transportation is very good and many people in New York City use it. Bensonhurt is an urban area, so it feels like New York City. When you are there, you will see many Asian stores. In the last 20 years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurt. Because of this, you can find an Asian-owned store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to reach. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurt is not only Asian. It is very mixed with people from many places. Many big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a park with ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The park is very mixed with many different people. In this area, there are not many big office buildings. There are co-ops and apartment buildings. Most homes are two-family houses. People here are nice but can be loud. You will hear cars with loud music or cars going fast. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might meet people who cause trouble, like bullies and thieves. I was bullied here in the past, but that was many years ago. Recently, there was package stealing. Package theft happens here. Also, people do not always clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on your way to places like the train station or supermarket. It bothers me to see dog waste on the ground. Watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see it on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. Some people see this slogan as a call to remember Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. Back then, Portland was less famous and less costly. It was a place with creative and unique subcultures. Others see it as an invitation to come to Portland, where being called weird is a good thing. Even with many people moving from California and new buildings for them, Portland stays weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it does mean accepting unusual things. Weird does not mean we lack modern things or modern battles. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our stuff from China. There are many ways to be weird, or not normal, but Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and in many Portland neighborhoods, there are colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes in summer. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone does not need anymore, but they can also be bags or plastic boxes. These boxes can have something special, a perfect treasure for someone passing by. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical chance of finding something in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is about. That is what Portland is about to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many. Some people here would never pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people might go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real goats) or attend Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many different things. Portland is full of people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. This problem often links to mental health issues, and the long rainy season and gray skies make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness issue, and no one seems to have a solution. The homeless come for Portland's social services, which are better than in most places, but still not enough. People who are not homeless feel both caring and dislike for the homeless. In this way, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set. I may forget them. I may be busy with work and life. Yet, they stay. They do not change. When I am most stressed, I look at them. They give me peace. They give me strength. I moved here for college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I loved. The university has nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special to me. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied. You can walk or take the bus to downtown. There, old bricks line the streets. The town feels busy like a city. Yet, it is still quiet. Past the library, it is peaceful again. This city feels full of wonder. It asks to be explored. I have many good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. I ran to the theater to watch a movie. But there are also hard memories. The ponds are good for thinking. I cried there at two in the morning. I watched turtles, ducks, and bugs. I thought about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond and park. I went to the main street. The sun shone on the palm trees. The sky was bright. I looked up at the sunrise. I was walking north. The mountains were there. They touched the sky. They made me feel strong.",
            "At first, you might not notice this place. It is a living area behind a row of stores. You might not think people live there. But if you walk behind the old Whole Foods and past the hotels that are busy in summer, you will find a busy area. There are many apartment buildings. They sit next to each other like Russian dolls set in a line. \n\nThe first apartments have a bad reputation, so let us not talk much about those. But the apartments next to them are different. Few in the area know about them. Across from these buildings is a small campus of a community college. It is a quiet place. Students come in the morning with coffee to start their day. The gates open for them slowly. People driving by get upset when the traffic slows down.\n\nThe road here meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has nice furniture outside and a fan that turns in the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and roll on the grass. Bees fly among the flowers. Old people walk their dogs. They frown at teenagers on skateboards but smile at girls talking by the playground. \n\nNext to the park, there is a strip mall. It has a sushi place with cheap food, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon. You can buy things for your pool, get your nails done, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens gather. They eat yogurt and do tricks on skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is in the quiet south where not much changes, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for one family. Some homes are split into two parts, but still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. It looks like most of the other houses. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to welcome the people of this country. Now it is moving away. But my neighborhood and many others are still here. They tell us and visitors that the dream is still alive. We hold onto it as best we can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The small yards are not as well kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in every driveway. Kids still play like the world around them is all that exists. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It brings hope for the future in young people. It also brings memories to older people. There are a few churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. All the homes look different but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people living here are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in the street and stop when cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have been here for many years. They can tell stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not go there much. Older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is one expressway that goes through my town. But the exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. Young people liked the idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would ruin the town. They convinced the city council to say no. A new high school is being built. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "I live in a large city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are spread out between business areas. There are many businesses here. Some are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are always new restaurants and stores to try. Some stores are big and well-known. Others are small boutiques. These small stores are in malls and also along the streets. The streets are close to the homes. There are also parks nearby. People go to these parks with their children.\n\nThe people in my neighborhood are very different from each other. We have a strong LGBTQ+ community. There is an Orthodox Jewish community. We also have refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are more people from different races and places. They often have their own communities. We have places called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These are just a few miles away. But a few miles can be a long drive. A 10-mile drive can take two hours because of traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in my city. The city is big, and people do not like to walk to places. We have some of the worst traffic in the world. It is hard to find parking spaces.\n\nThere is also a lot of building work happening. More large apartment buildings are being made. The city is popular, but current residents do not like the idea of more people moving in. They worry about more cars on the roads. There are many kinds of homes in my city. Not everyone lives in a big apartment building. There are houses of different sizes, smaller apartments, and condos. Some homes are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood too. We have different housing options. People here are of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But I remember playing outside with friends when I was young. My friends were my next-door neighbor and others from the neighborhood. We were all about the same age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the fields of corn. \"This is it!\" I said. She was shocked by the open land. She came from a town where the store was a short walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She learned more about me then. We drove on a two-lane road. We passed a quarry filled with water. Next is the small area where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take care of their land. In spring, there are many flowers. Trees change with the seasons. Driveways have shiny Mercedes Benz cars after a wash. As we go to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is outside. He smiles and mows his lawn. He sings while working. People like him. He was a doctor before. Now he is older. His mower is a John Deere. You reach my home. Geese are in the yard, chased by our Terrier. In the back, a small stream leads to the quarry. You hear frogs, the stream, and cows. Across a wooden bridge is a wild place with trees and flowers. I spent my childhood here. We built forts and chased animals. Winters here are cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to bare. Snow makes a wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen are in the yard. My sister and I fought with snowballs. We built forts for our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids, happy and free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You go from farms to small tourist towns here. There are no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is surrounded by water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to visit almost anywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some homes are old, some have been updated, and some are remodeled. Most homes have basements. You can see full basements from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. We have houses of every color. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show what Middle America is like. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have already raised them. \n\nYou will see kids running up and down the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who fits in and who doesn’t. You see someone grilling outside and wave. You see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns are kept in good shape. No leaves are piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood. But it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. \n\nOur town has a county sheriff’s department and jail nearby. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers call the names of players. Our small airport is next to that. You can hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. You can go downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group makes sure all houses look good. The front yards have grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big boxes for packages. My house is on the edge of the city, so it is a mix of rural and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools that people can use. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking trails for walking or running. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People help each other. We also have some middle-aged and young workers. The city is big in population but feels like a small town. We have many things we need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to places, but there are many shops there. We have expensive grocery stores and discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and trails. If you want to shop, you can drive to many big stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It talked about people who were missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we have learned to save money. We like the smell of old toys and clothes from the market. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to things. The market always has a smell. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you clean it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it is quiet. It is nice to spend an afternoon there. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city. It is home to a big online company for selling and delivery. It still grows. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people ask questions because they care. Here, you do not get into other people's lives. You can keep to yourself, and the city moves like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs always do something. We are more like friends than strangers. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring them their mail and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not a rich area. Most houses are owned or rented by people with low incomes. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello on the street. Crime is higher here than in other parts of town, but still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. This includes shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been affected by crime, except for some things taken from our porch now and then. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the U.S. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But my town has resources to help fight this problem. There are centers for addiction help and training for using Narcan, a drug that can save lives. \n\nThis town has good things too. My son's elementary school is great. The staff, teachers, and support people are excellent. My son has special needs but has not faced bullying. The school has a positive atmosphere, and he loves it. We have an active PTO that plans events for families. Over 20% of the people here are poor. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is left hungry. School fees, supplies, and trips are affordable. \n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They repaved roads and fixed parks. But most changes are in the center and west side of town. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This bothers people in my area. \n\nOverall, I like living here. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are enough stores for my family's needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We cannot imagine living somewhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill with buildings that have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. A block down from here is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see people waiting to get in. There is a big city park a few blocks away. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people put tents on the sidewalk and steps. It rains a lot, making it hard to stay warm. They put tents together in the center of town to stay warm. They are close to a family center where they can wash. What I love about my city is not the old buildings or the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. People still tell stories about that time. People work hard to keep it clean now. They care about their city and block. Some say if you're white, don't walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is an old belief. Maybe I look different enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist in our nation. Hilltop is home to me. I feel alive walking there at night. People are kind and offer help. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when it rains. It is a place where someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is one or two minutes from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other guys from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like swings and slides. They get excited about the park. The park makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are popular as in any suburb. There are many pizza places too. Stores here have what you need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse, like an Indian-owned store if you want Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read on social media or see on the news about others' bad experiences with neighbors, it makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not very expensive. One bar just got a new name. It costs more to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have lower income because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children because an elementary school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener by their door. My boyfriend and I find that funny. It is almost insulting. The buildings near me look old, but they might be nice inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them. I know they are not built well. They are cheap to build but cost a lot to rent. I think this is not fair. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a very cheap restaurant five minutes from my home. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city fixed the road. Now, there is a big sidewalk, and grass on the sides. The area looks nicer now. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut, so there are stumps. There are more trees here than down the road. Behind my apartment is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees on this street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But I cannot blame only them. There are also apartments across the street from me with crime and many people moving in and out. I think I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close. There are two bus stops, so I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are placed apart so they look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. Some evenings, we stand outside and talk while the children play. It feels nice in this modern world full of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. There are fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds around us. \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens and had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog with my purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the change in temperature. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. I looked up at the sky, and the sun came out. It started to rain and a double rainbow appeared. I ran inside, got my camera, and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. \n\nI recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The outside of the houses looks the same, but the inside does not. Some apartments are quite small, which I find odd. I like to walk by the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey at a farm nearby that brays at night. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have been here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a better place with good homes and schools. At first, everything was new and strange, but I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school.\n\nI did not know many of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who live next door. They are nice people and feel like family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun. They got re-married. I caught the white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers! We all danced and had a good time. I also danced with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since, but I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. Now, I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I used to hang out with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and enjoyed life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It calms me and gives me peace. I bring sticks from the store to practice my balance, and sometimes I bring my wooden sword. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played them in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me how to play tennis. We worked hard but had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. The town is called Johnston. It is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the town entrance says this. Most of the land is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. These roofs help keep houses cool in summer. Houses are often not near the road. They are set back with fields in front for animals or crops. \n\nIn the main town, there is one stop light at a crossing. The only stores are here. There are three places for quick food. Hong Kong is a small Chinese restaurant. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant is another. Gary's is a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small family-owned drug store called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only one in town. People often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. The store has been here for many years. It has two movers who deliver furniture. Next to it is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer many services for pets like grooming and bathing. \n\nThere is a small doctor’s office and a vet. They are not in the main town but are well-equipped. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but they are making a 2.5-acre recreation area. This will give families more to do and bring visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. There are not many restaurants. But it is a nice town. It is so small you can pass it quickly without knowing.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is a street that connects two highways. There is more traffic than I like, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs each day. In winter, we sled down a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people and cars coming and going all day. We know the cars people drive here. We notice when we see a new car. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids play on bikes and do other things you might expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters, and me. The girls are eleven and fourteen years old. I think people here are used to us too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill food on our back deck. It smells good. Many people cut grass here. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. There are many trees, so there is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. We do not have much Winter now, so Fall feels longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I work on my truck or other jobs in the garage sometimes. When the garage doors are open, I feel more part of the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have guests from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now it is the same, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has friendly old people. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For nicer stores, you have to travel far. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. Many people work in construction here. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live together safely. My family and I have adapted well. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things about the history and culture of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is a bit different. Most people think of houses and families. But my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like others in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. \n\nLet me tell you about the \"houses\" here. There are three kinds of houses. First, there are apartments. In each room, there are 2-4 people. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in one building. Second, there are real houses. People connected to the school can rent these. They usually have 2-4 bedrooms. Alumni often live in these houses. But there are not many of them. Last, there are dorm rooms. Hundreds of students live here. Usually, two people share one room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNext, the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. Stores offer dining and sell school clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because we all care for it!",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be dangerous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The repairs make the lines look like a patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big glass fronts on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water lights up and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car in the driveway for a month once, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children around, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and lawns. My cats love them and have hunted most away from our neighborhood. We also have birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores nearby, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks by the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is very good in New York City. Bensonhurst feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores there. In the past 20 years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on each block. Supermarkets and laundromats are common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are close by. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes walking distance. This makes grocery shopping easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is very mixed. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed. People from many groups play and get along there. There are not many big company buildings. You will find co-op or condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People are nice but noisy. Cars play loud music and speed by. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. There are bullies and thieves. I was bullied a long time ago. Packages also get stolen here sometimes. Even though there is a fine for not cleaning after dogs, people do not follow this rule. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or store. My biggest complaint is dog waste on the ground. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This is on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club. It almost breaks the law in some ways. For some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. That Portland was less known and cheaper. It had creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but as a compliment. Even with many rich people from California moving in, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we lack modern things and issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our items from China. There are many ways to be weird or not normal. But Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others, we have colorful houses and home gardens. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets. In summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone no longer wants. They can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Free boxes hold something special for the person who walks by. This magical feeling when walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, it is for me. I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never get their clothes from a box on the street. Those people might go to goat yoga or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many things. We follow our dreams or think about following them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often mental health problems. The rain and gray clouds much of the year seem to add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. Nobody seems to know what to do about it. Homeless people come for Portland's social services, which are better than most places. But our services are not enough, like everywhere else. The non-homeless people feel both care and hate. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they watch the sun every morning and every evening. Even when I do not think about them or I am too busy with life and work, they are there. They do not change. On days when I feel most stressed, they ask me to see them. When I look at them, they help me feel calm. They give me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I noticed. The university has many beautiful sights like buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I spent hours studying with coffee. You can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. There, you find old buildings made of faded bricks with restaurants and offices. This part of town feels busy and lively, like a big city. But it is not very big. You can quickly find peace again by passing the library. This mix of busy and quiet places makes the city feel exciting and new. You can make many good memories in different parts of town. Like walking past old swings in the park with friends after staying up all night. Or running through downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are a good place to think or cry at two in the morning during a hard time. I have done this often. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, I wondered about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond, the park, and small houses, until I reached a main street. Then the sun shone on the palm trees and lit up the sky. I looked up at the sunrise and saw I was walking north. The mountains were there, as always. They stood tall against the sky, more than any building. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a living area behind some stores. You would not think people live there. But if you go behind the old, empty Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that are busy only during family reunions in summer, you will find a busy community. In this place, there are many apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, placed carefully along the road. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk about them much. But the apartments next to those, and the two other buildings beside them, are different. Few people know about them.\n\nAcross from these homes is a community college's small campus. It is a quiet place by the road where students come with coffee, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers in cars get upset with the slow traffic when many students come. The road meets another road with homes. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has happy-looking porch chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park, running and turning on the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and frown at teens on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking about boys and YouTube by the playground.\n\nNear the park is a strip mall with a sushi place that is not too busy. There is a swimming store and a nail salon too. You can get pool supplies, a manicure, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where you make your own dessert. Teens in the park often hold cups of yogurt with toppings while they skate and think it looks cool. This neighborhood is a piece of American life, where not much changes in the quiet south.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still together. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It looks like many other houses from a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. This dream was once strong, but now it is less clear. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand. They remind us and visitors that the dream is still alive. People try to hold onto it as best they can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The little yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. The youth still play as if their world is all that matters. The public school is almost 90 years old. It still stands. It still gives hope to today's youth. It also makes older people feel nostalgic. There are few churches, and most are empty. But the basketball courts are full. All houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". A large Yemeni family owns it. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in them. They stop only to let cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but kids lost interest. It is now a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It plays old movies at a lower price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new films. Older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. The youth liked the idea, but the elders did not. They said having the expressway would harm our town. The city council denied the request. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best choice.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Houses and stores are mixed together. Some stores have offices. Others are shops, places to eat, or for fun. There are always new places to try. Some shops are big and famous. Others are small and special. These small shops are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to homes and are busy with people. There are also parks nearby. Families with children often visit these parks.\n\nThere are many different groups of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not far, but traffic is bad. Driving 10 miles can take two hours. Most people do not walk because the city is big. We have very bad traffic, and parking is hard to find. Many new buildings are going up. This city is popular, but not everyone is happy about more people and cars.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes here. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in houses or small apartments. Some homes are for one family, others are for two families. My neighborhood has many types of houses. The people are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen this much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane country road. We reached a quarry filled with water. Past it is the small place I live in. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least a half-acre of land. People take pride in their land. In spring, flowers and trees are everywhere. The driveways have Mercedes Benz cars. They shine in the sun after a wash. As we went to my grey stucco home, I saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly face. He spends all day mowing his lawn. You can hear him sing over the mower's sound. People in the neighborhood like him. He was a doctor. Now he is older and not as sharp as he once was. Finally, we reach my home. In the side yard, geese are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters here can be very cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to empty. Trees lose their leaves. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears. The backyard has snow angels and snowmen made by my sister. We often fought as kids. In winter, we used snowballs. We built forts with branches to hide our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You go from farms to small tourist towns here. There are no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is surrounded by water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to visit almost anywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some homes are old, some have been updated, and some are remodeled. Most homes have basements. You can see full basements from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. We have houses of every color. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show what Middle America is like. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have already raised them. \n\nYou will see kids running up and down the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who fits in and who doesn’t. You see someone grilling outside and wave. You see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns are kept in good shape. No leaves are piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood. But it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. \n\nOur town has a county sheriff’s department and jail nearby. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers call the names of players. Our small airport is next to that. You can hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. You can go downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group makes sure all houses look good. The front yards have grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big boxes for packages. My house is on the edge of the city, so it is a mix of rural and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools that people can use. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking trails for walking or running. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People help each other. We also have some middle-aged and young workers. The city is big in population but feels like a small town. We have many things we need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to places, but there are many shops there. We have expensive grocery stores and discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and trails. If you want to shop, you can drive to many big stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It talked about people who were missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we have learned to save money. We like the smell of old toys and clothes from the market. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to things. The market always has a smell. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you clean it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it is quiet. It is nice to spend an afternoon there. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city. It is home to a big online company for selling and delivery. It still grows. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people ask questions because they care. Here, you do not get into other people's lives. You can keep to yourself, and the city moves like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs always do something. We are more like friends than strangers. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring them their mail and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not a rich area. Most houses are owned or rented by people with low incomes. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello on the street. Crime is higher here than in other parts of town, but still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. This includes shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been affected by crime, except for some things taken from our porch now and then. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the U.S. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But my town has resources to help fight this problem. There are centers for addiction help and training for using Narcan, a drug that can save lives. \n\nThis town has good things too. My son's elementary school is great. The staff, teachers, and support people are excellent. My son has special needs but has not faced bullying. The school has a positive atmosphere, and he loves it. We have an active PTO that plans events for families. Over 20% of the people here are poor. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is left hungry. School fees, supplies, and trips are affordable. \n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They repaved roads and fixed parks. But most changes are in the center and west side of town. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This bothers people in my area. \n\nOverall, I like living here. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are enough stores for my family's needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We cannot imagine living somewhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill with buildings that have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. A block down from here is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see people waiting to get in. There is a big city park a few blocks away. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people put tents on the sidewalk and steps. It rains a lot, making it hard to stay warm. They put tents together in the center of town to stay warm. They are close to a family center where they can wash. What I love about my city is not the old buildings or the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. People still tell stories about that time. People work hard to keep it clean now. They care about their city and block. Some say if you're white, don't walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is an old belief. Maybe I look different enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist in our nation. Hilltop is home to me. I feel alive walking there at night. People are kind and offer help. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when it rains. It is a place where someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is one or two minutes from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other guys from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like swings and slides. They get excited about the park. The park makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are popular as in any suburb. There are many pizza places too. Stores here have what you need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse, like an Indian-owned store if you want Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read on social media or see on the news about others' bad experiences with neighbors, it makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not very expensive. One bar just got a new name. It costs more to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have lower income because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children because an elementary school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener by their door. My boyfriend and I find that funny. It is almost insulting. The buildings near me look old, but they might be nice inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them. I know they are not built well. They are cheap to build but cost a lot to rent. I think this is not fair. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a very cheap restaurant five minutes from my home. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city fixed the road. Now, there is a big sidewalk, and grass on the sides. The area looks nicer now. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut, so there are stumps. There are more trees here than down the road. Behind my apartment is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees on this street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But I cannot blame only them. There are also apartments across the street from me with crime and many people moving in and out. I think I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close. There are two bus stops, so I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are placed apart so they look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. Some evenings, we stand outside and talk while the children play. It feels nice in this modern world full of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. There are fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds around us. \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens and had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog with my purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the change in temperature. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. I looked up at the sky, and the sun came out. It started to rain and a double rainbow appeared. I ran inside, got my camera, and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. \n\nI recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The outside of the houses looks the same, but the inside does not. Some apartments are quite small, which I find odd. I like to walk by the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey at a farm nearby that brays at night. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have been here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a better place with good homes and schools. At first, everything was new and strange, but I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school.\n\nI did not know many of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who live next door. They are nice people and feel like family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun. They got re-married. I caught the white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers! We all danced and had a good time. I also danced with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since, but I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. Now, I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I used to hang out with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and enjoyed life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It calms me and gives me peace. I bring sticks from the store to practice my balance, and sometimes I bring my wooden sword. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played them in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me how to play tennis. We worked hard but had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. The town is called Johnston. It is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the town entrance says this. Most of the land is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. These roofs help keep houses cool in summer. Houses are often not near the road. They are set back with fields in front for animals or crops. \n\nIn the main town, there is one stop light at a crossing. The only stores are here. There are three places for quick food. Hong Kong is a small Chinese restaurant. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant is another. Gary's is a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small family-owned drug store called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only one in town. People often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. The store has been here for many years. It has two movers who deliver furniture. Next to it is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer many services for pets like grooming and bathing. \n\nThere is a small doctor’s office and a vet. They are not in the main town but are well-equipped. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but they are making a 2.5-acre recreation area. This will give families more to do and bring visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. There are not many restaurants. But it is a nice town. It is so small you can pass it quickly without knowing.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is a street that connects two highways. There is more traffic than I like, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs each day. In winter, we sled down a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people and cars coming and going all day. We know the cars people drive here. We notice when we see a new car. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids play on bikes and do other things you might expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters, and me. The girls are eleven and fourteen years old. I think people here are used to us too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill food on our back deck. It smells good. Many people cut grass here. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. There are many trees, so there is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. We do not have much Winter now, so Fall feels longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I work on my truck or other jobs in the garage sometimes. When the garage doors are open, I feel more part of the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have guests from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now it is the same, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has friendly old people. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For nicer stores, you have to travel far. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. Many people work in construction here. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live together safely. My family and I have adapted well. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things about the history and culture of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is a bit different. Most people think of houses and families. But my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like others in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. \n\nLet me tell you about the \"houses\" here. There are three kinds of houses. First, there are apartments. In each room, there are 2-4 people. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in one building. Second, there are real houses. People connected to the school can rent these. They usually have 2-4 bedrooms. Alumni often live in these houses. But there are not many of them. Last, there are dorm rooms. Hundreds of students live here. Usually, two people share one room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNext, the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. Stores offer dining and sell school clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because we all care for it!",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be dangerous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The repairs make the lines look like a patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big glass fronts on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water lights up and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car in the driveway for a month once, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children around, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and lawns. My cats love them and have hunted most away from our neighborhood. We also have birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores nearby, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks by the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is very good in New York City. Bensonhurst feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores there. In the past 20 years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on each block. Supermarkets and laundromats are common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are close by. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes walking distance. This makes grocery shopping easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is very mixed. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed. People from many groups play and get along there. There are not many big company buildings. You will find co-op or condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People are nice but noisy. Cars play loud music and speed by. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. There are bullies and thieves. I was bullied a long time ago. Packages also get stolen here sometimes. Even though there is a fine for not cleaning after dogs, people do not follow this rule. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or store. My biggest complaint is dog waste on the ground. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This is on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club. It almost breaks the law in some ways. For some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. That Portland was less known and cheaper. It had creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but as a compliment. Even with many rich people from California moving in, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we lack modern things and issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our items from China. There are many ways to be weird or not normal. But Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others, we have colorful houses and home gardens. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets. In summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone no longer wants. They can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Free boxes hold something special for the person who walks by. This magical feeling when walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, it is for me. I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never get their clothes from a box on the street. Those people might go to goat yoga or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many things. We follow our dreams or think about following them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often mental health problems. The rain and gray clouds much of the year seem to add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. Nobody seems to know what to do about it. Homeless people come for Portland's social services, which are better than most places. But our services are not enough, like everywhere else. The non-homeless people feel both care and hate. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they watch the sun every morning and every evening. Even when I do not think about them or I am too busy with life and work, they are there. They do not change. On days when I feel most stressed, they ask me to see them. When I look at them, they help me feel calm. They give me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I noticed. The university has many beautiful sights like buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I spent hours studying with coffee. You can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. There, you find old buildings made of faded bricks with restaurants and offices. This part of town feels busy and lively, like a big city. But it is not very big. You can quickly find peace again by passing the library. This mix of busy and quiet places makes the city feel exciting and new. You can make many good memories in different parts of town. Like walking past old swings in the park with friends after staying up all night. Or running through downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are a good place to think or cry at two in the morning during a hard time. I have done this often. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, I wondered about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond, the park, and small houses, until I reached a main street. Then the sun shone on the palm trees and lit up the sky. I looked up at the sunrise and saw I was walking north. The mountains were there, as always. They stood tall against the sky, more than any building. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a living area behind some stores. You would not think people live there. But if you go behind the old, empty Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that are busy only during family reunions in summer, you will find a busy community. In this place, there are many apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, placed carefully along the road. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk about them much. But the apartments next to those, and the two other buildings beside them, are different. Few people know about them.\n\nAcross from these homes is a community college's small campus. It is a quiet place by the road where students come with coffee, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers in cars get upset with the slow traffic when many students come. The road meets another road with homes. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has happy-looking porch chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park, running and turning on the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and frown at teens on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking about boys and YouTube by the playground.\n\nNear the park is a strip mall with a sushi place that is not too busy. There is a swimming store and a nail salon too. You can get pool supplies, a manicure, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where you make your own dessert. Teens in the park often hold cups of yogurt with toppings while they skate and think it looks cool. This neighborhood is a piece of American life, where not much changes in the quiet south.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still together. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It looks like many other houses from a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. This dream was once strong, but now it is less clear. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand. They remind us and visitors that the dream is still alive. People try to hold onto it as best they can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The little yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. The youth still play as if their world is all that matters. The public school is almost 90 years old. It still stands. It still gives hope to today's youth. It also makes older people feel nostalgic. There are few churches, and most are empty. But the basketball courts are full. All houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". A large Yemeni family owns it. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in them. They stop only to let cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but kids lost interest. It is now a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It plays old movies at a lower price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new films. Older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. The youth liked the idea, but the elders did not. They said having the expressway would harm our town. The city council denied the request. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best choice.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Houses and stores are mixed together. Some stores have offices. Others are shops, places to eat, or for fun. There are always new places to try. Some shops are big and famous. Others are small and special. These small shops are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to homes and are busy with people. There are also parks nearby. Families with children often visit these parks.\n\nThere are many different groups of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not far, but traffic is bad. Driving 10 miles can take two hours. Most people do not walk because the city is big. We have very bad traffic, and parking is hard to find. Many new buildings are going up. This city is popular, but not everyone is happy about more people and cars.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes here. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in houses or small apartments. Some homes are for one family, others are for two families. My neighborhood has many types of houses. The people are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen this much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane country road. We reached a quarry filled with water. Past it is the small place I live in. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least a half-acre of land. People take pride in their land. In spring, flowers and trees are everywhere. The driveways have Mercedes Benz cars. They shine in the sun after a wash. As we went to my grey stucco home, I saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly face. He spends all day mowing his lawn. You can hear him sing over the mower's sound. People in the neighborhood like him. He was a doctor. Now he is older and not as sharp as he once was. Finally, we reach my home. In the side yard, geese are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters here can be very cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to empty. Trees lose their leaves. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears. The backyard has snow angels and snowmen made by my sister. We often fought as kids. In winter, we used snowballs. We built forts with branches to hide our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You go from farms to small tourist towns here. There are no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is surrounded by water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to visit almost anywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some homes are old, some have been updated, and some are remodeled. Most homes have basements. You can see full basements from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. We have houses of every color. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show what Middle America is like. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have already raised them. \n\nYou will see kids running up and down the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who fits in and who doesn’t. You see someone grilling outside and wave. You see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns are kept in good shape. No leaves are piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood. But it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. \n\nOur town has a county sheriff’s department and jail nearby. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road.

You can hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. You can go downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group makes sure all houses look good. The front yards have grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big boxes for packages. My house is on the edge of the city, so it is a mix of rural and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools that people can use. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking trails for walking or running. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People help each other. We also have some middle-aged and young workers. The city is big in population but feels like a small town. We have many things we need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to places, but there are many shops there. We have expensive grocery stores and discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and trails. If you want to shop, you can drive to many big stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It talked about people who were missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we have learned to save money. We like the smell of old toys and clothes from the market. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to things. The market always has a smell. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you clean it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it is quiet. It is nice to spend an afternoon there. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city. It is home to a big online company for selling and delivery. It still grows. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people ask questions because they care. Here, you do not get into other people's lives. You can keep to yourself, and the city moves like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs always do something. We are more like friends than strangers. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring them their mail and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not a rich area. Most houses are owned or rented by people with low incomes. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello on the street. Crime is higher here than in other parts of town, but still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. This includes shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been affected by crime, except for some things taken from our porch now and then. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the U.S. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But my town has resources to help fight this problem. There are centers for addiction help and training for using Narcan, a drug that can save lives. \n\nThis town has good things too. My son's elementary school is great. The staff, teachers, and support people are excellent. My son has special needs but has not faced bullying. The school has a positive atmosphere, and he loves it. We have an active PTO that plans events for families. Over 20% of the people here are poor. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is left hungry. School fees, supplies, and trips are affordable. \n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They repaved roads and fixed parks. But most changes are in the center and west side of town. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This bothers people in my area. \n\nOverall, I like living here. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are enough stores for my family's needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We cannot imagine living somewhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill with buildings that have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. A block down from here is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see people waiting to get in. There is a big city park a few blocks away. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people put tents on the sidewalk and steps. It rains a lot, making it hard to stay warm. They put tents together in the center of town to stay warm. They are close to a family center where they can wash. What I love about my city is not the old buildings or the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. People still tell stories about that time. People work hard to keep it clean now. They care about their city and block. Some say if you're white, don't walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is an old belief. Maybe I look different enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist in our nation. Hilltop is home to me. I feel alive walking there at night. People are kind and offer help. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when it rains. It is a place where someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is one or two minutes from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other guys from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like swings and slides. They get excited about the park. The park makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are popular as in any suburb. There are many pizza places too. Stores here have what you need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse, like an Indian-owned store if you want Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read on social media or see on the news about others' bad experiences with neighbors, it makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not very expensive. One bar just got a new name. It costs more to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have lower income because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children because an elementary school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener by their door. My boyfriend and I find that funny. It is almost insulting. The buildings near me look old, but they might be nice inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them. I know they are not built well. They are cheap to build but cost a lot to rent. I think this is not fair. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a very cheap restaurant five minutes from my home. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city fixed the road. Now, there is a big sidewalk, and grass on the sides. The area looks nicer now. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut, so there are stumps. There are more trees here than down the road. Behind my apartment is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees on this street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But I cannot blame only them. There are also apartments across the street from me with crime and many people moving in and out. I think I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close. There are two bus stops, so I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are placed apart so they look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. Some evenings, we stand outside and talk while the children play. It feels nice in this modern world full of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. There are fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds around us. \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens and had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog with my purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the change in temperature. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. I looked up at the sky, and the sun came out. It started to rain and a double rainbow appeared. I ran inside, got my camera, and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. \n\nI recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The outside of the houses looks the same, but the inside does not. Some apartments are quite small, which I find odd. I like to walk by the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey at a farm nearby that brays at night. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have been here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a better place with good homes and schools. At first, everything was new and strange, but I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school.\n\nI did not know many of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who live next door. They are nice people and feel like family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun. They got re-married. I caught the white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers! We all danced and had a good time. I also danced with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since, but I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. Now, I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I used to hang out with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and enjoyed life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It calms me and gives me peace. I bring sticks from the store to practice my balance, and sometimes I bring my wooden sword. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played them in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me how to play tennis. We worked hard but had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. The town is called Johnston. It is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the town entrance says this. Most of the land is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. These roofs help keep houses cool in summer. Houses are often not near the road. They are set back with fields in front for animals or crops. \n\nIn the main town, there is one stop light at a crossing. The only stores are here. There are three places for quick food. Hong Kong is a small Chinese restaurant. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant is another. Gary's is a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small family-owned drug store called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only one in town. People often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. The store has been here for many years. It has two movers who deliver furniture. Next to it is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer many services for pets like grooming and bathing. \n\nThere is a small doctor’s office and a vet. They are not in the main town but are well-equipped. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but they are making a 2.5-acre recreation area. This will give families more to do and bring visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. There are not many restaurants. But it is a nice town. It is so small you can pass it quickly without knowing.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is a street that connects two highways. There is more traffic than I like, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs each day. In winter, we sled down a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people and cars coming and going all day. We know the cars people drive here. We notice when we see a new car. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids play on bikes and do other things you might expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters, and me. The girls are eleven and fourteen years old. I think people here are used to us too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill food on our back deck. It smells good. Many people cut grass here. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. There are many trees, so there is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. We do not have much Winter now, so Fall feels longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I work on my truck or other jobs in the garage sometimes. When the garage doors are open, I feel more part of the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have guests from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now it is the same, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has friendly old people. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For nicer stores, you have to travel far. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. Many people work in construction here. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live together safely. My family and I have adapted well. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things about the history and culture of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is a bit different. Most people think of houses and families. But my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like others in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. \n\nLet me tell you about the \"houses\" here. There are three kinds of houses. First, there are apartments. In each room, there are 2-4 people. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in one building. Second, there are real houses. People connected to the school can rent these. They usually have 2-4 bedrooms. Alumni often live in these houses. But there are not many of them. Last, there are dorm rooms. Hundreds of students live here. Usually, two people share one room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNext, the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. Stores offer dining and sell school clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because we all care for it!",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be dangerous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The repairs make the lines look like a patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big glass fronts on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water lights up and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car in the driveway for a month once, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children around, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and lawns. My cats love them and have hunted most away from our neighborhood. We also have birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores nearby, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks by the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is very good in New York City. Bensonhurst feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores there. In the past 20 years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on each block. Supermarkets and laundromats are common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are close by. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes walking distance. This makes grocery shopping easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is very mixed. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed. People from many groups play and get along there. There are not many big company buildings. You will find co-op or condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People are nice but noisy. Cars play loud music and speed by. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. There are bullies and thieves. I was bullied a long time ago. Packages also get stolen here sometimes. Even though there is a fine for not cleaning after dogs, people do not follow this rule. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or store. My biggest complaint is dog waste on the ground. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This is on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club. It almost breaks the law in some ways. For some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. That Portland was less known and cheaper. It had creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but as a compliment. Even with many rich people from California moving in, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we lack modern things and issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our items from China. There are many ways to be weird or not normal. But Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others, we have colorful houses and home gardens. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets. In summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone no longer wants. They can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Free boxes hold something special for the person who walks by. This magical feeling when walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, it is for me. I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never get their clothes from a box on the street. Those people might go to goat yoga or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many things. We follow our dreams or think about following them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often mental health problems. The rain and gray clouds much of the year seem to add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. Nobody seems to know what to do about it. Homeless people come for Portland's social services, which are better than most places. But our services are not enough, like everywhere else. The non-homeless people feel both care and hate. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they watch the sun every morning and every evening. Even when I do not think about them or I am too busy with life and work, they are there. They do not change. On days when I feel most stressed, they ask me to see them. When I look at them, they help me feel calm. They give me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I noticed. The university has many beautiful sights like buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I spent hours studying with coffee. You can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. There, you find old buildings made of faded bricks with restaurants and offices. This part of town feels busy and lively, like a big city. But it is not very big. You can quickly find peace again by passing the library. This mix of busy and quiet places makes the city feel exciting and new. You can make many good memories in different parts of town. Like walking past old swings in the park with friends after staying up all night. Or running through downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are a good place to think or cry at two in the morning during a hard time. I have done this often. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, I wondered about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond, the park, and small houses, until I reached a main street. Then the sun shone on the palm trees and lit up the sky. I looked up at the sunrise and saw I was walking north. The mountains were there, as always. They stood tall against the sky, more than any building. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a living area behind some stores. You would not think people live there. But if you go behind the old, empty Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that are busy only during family reunions in summer, you will find a busy community. In this place, there are many apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, placed carefully along the road. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk about them much. But the apartments next to those, and the two other buildings beside them, are different. Few people know about them.\n\nAcross from these homes is a community college's small campus. It is a quiet place by the road where students come with coffee, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers in cars get upset with the slow traffic when many students come. The road meets another road with homes. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has happy-looking porch chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park, running and turning on the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and frown at teens on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking about boys and YouTube by the playground.\n\nNear the park is a strip mall with a sushi place that is not too busy. There is a swimming store and a nail salon too. You can get pool supplies, a manicure, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where you make your own dessert. Teens in the park often hold cups of yogurt with toppings while they skate and think it looks cool. This neighborhood is a piece of American life, where not much changes in the quiet south.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still together. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It looks like many other houses from a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. This dream was once strong, but now it is less clear. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand. They remind us and visitors that the dream is still alive. People try to hold onto it as best they can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The little yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. The youth still play as if their world is all that matters. The public school is almost 90 years old. It still stands. It still gives hope to today's youth. It also makes older people feel nostalgic. There are few churches, and most are empty. But the basketball courts are full. All houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". A large Yemeni family owns it. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in them. They stop only to let cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but kids lost interest. It is now a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It plays old movies at a lower price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new films. Older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. The youth liked the idea, but the elders did not. They said having the expressway would harm our town. The city council denied the request. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best choice.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Houses and stores are mixed together. Some stores have offices. Others are shops, places to eat, or for fun. There are always new places to try. Some shops are big and famous. Others are small and special. These small shops are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to homes and are busy with people. There are also parks nearby. Families with children often visit these parks.\n\nThere are many different groups of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not far, but traffic is bad. Driving 10 miles can take two hours. Most people do not walk because the city is big. We have very bad traffic, and parking is hard to find. Many new buildings are going up. This city is popular, but not everyone is happy about more people and cars.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes here. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in houses or small apartments. Some homes are for one family, others are for two families. My neighborhood has many types of houses. The people are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen this much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane country road. We reached a quarry filled with water. Past it is the small place I live in. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least a half-acre of land. People take pride in their land. In spring, flowers and trees are everywhere. The driveways have Mercedes Benz cars. They shine in the sun after a wash. As we went to my grey stucco home, I saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly face. He spends all day mowing his lawn. You can hear him sing over the mower's sound. People in the neighborhood like him. He was a doctor. Now he is older and not as sharp as he once was. Finally, we reach my home. In the side yard, geese are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters here can be very cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to empty. Trees lose their leaves. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears. The backyard has snow angels and snowmen made by my sister. We often fought as kids. In winter, we used snowballs. We built forts with branches to hide our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. Here, you see farmland and small cities where people visit. There are no big malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place with water all around. My town is near water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach everywhere you go. \n\nMy neighborhood looks like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some are old, some are updated. Most houses have basements. You can see these basements from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are houses in every color you can think of. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. Hard-working people live here. They make a living and raise families. \n\nAny day, you see kids running in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who belongs and who does not. You wave to someone grilling outside or smile at someone walking a dog. Lawns are kept neat. Leaves are not left from fall. Grass is green and cut. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It looks average, but it is special because it is a safe place to end your day. \n\nNearby, there is the sheriff’s department and jail. The health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields. You can hear announcers call names and scores. Our small airport is nearby. You hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk downtown from here. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association here. Because of this, the houses are well-kept. The front yards look similar. There is some grass, some stones, and short driveways. You might also see small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the roads. Most houses have one floor, some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. People use keys to open their mailbox. There are also two large boxes for packages. My house is at the edge of the city, so we have both land and suburb. There are many pools here. People living here can use them. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking paths. You can walk your dog or walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to walk or run. The area is safe. Many people who live here are retired. Some are middle-aged or young workers. The city nearby is large in people but small in feel. It has most things you need. There is one mall. It is small but enough. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to places. There are many stores to choose from. We have grocery stores that sell organic food. We also have discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and paths. We are not close to shopping, but a short drive gets you to many stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It was about people who went missing. This surprised me. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I never heard that story before, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. I know some of my friends cry when they go to sleep. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over time. We like the dusty smell of old toys and clothes. You smell less as an adult. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to it. But the flea market smell stays. The smell of being an adult is like dusty magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but the stores are quiet. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store stays silent. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is the home of one of the largest online companies for shopping and delivery, but it still has growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has goals, and not much is asked from you. You can be alone and quiet, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means you ask questions. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you want, and the city moves like waves on a beach. It is a lively place. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something going on. In a way, we are not strangers but more like friends. We come together when needed, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a big, modern place, but my neighbors make me feel like I made a good choice.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not rich. Houses cost less here. Many people rent or own these homes, and they do not have much money. But the place is nice. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is not high here, just a bit more than other parts of town. In the last ten years, there have been a few violent crimes near my home. A few shootings happened, and one person was killed. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been hurt by crime, except sometimes things disappear from our porch when we forget to bring them in. \n\nThe town has been hit hard by the “opioid epidemic” in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are many resources to fight this problem. We have several places for addiction help and Narcan training for families. Despite these problems, there are good things here. My son’s school is very good. The principal, teachers, and staff are all excellent. My son has special needs, but he has not been bullied at school. He loves it there. The school has a strong PTO that plans many events to involve families and help students learn. Because more than 20% of people in our town are poor, the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child goes hungry. No one is treated as less important because they cannot pay. School costs are fair for everyone.\n\nThe City Council has made many changes to make our town look better. They fix roads, plant flowers, and improve parks. But most of these changes are in the center of town and on the west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often left out. People in my neighborhood are unhappy about this. \n\nOverall, I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough shops. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice and enough for us. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture. It is on a hill and old buildings are around it. I live in an apartment building with 7 floors. It is across from the old live Theater. A block down the hill is a small, fun arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. In June and July, you will often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete with tall stairs in the wall. In winter, homeless people set up their tents in rows on the sidewalk and the wide steps. It does not snow much, but it rains hard in mid-winter. This makes it hard to stay warm. They set their tents close together. This keeps them warmer. They are also close to the family center where they can bathe. What I love about my city is not just the old buildings but the culture of the people. Hilltop once had much gang violence. People still talk about when the government tried to clean the streets. People remember those times. They work hard to keep it nice even if it is still a tough area. They care about their city and their block. Some say if you are white, do not walk around Hilltop after dark. I think this is from the past. Maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know Hilltop is home for me. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are more likely to offer help than harm. It is a place where laundromat owners stay open so I can charge my phone. It is a place where when I feel alone, someone stops and tells me I am beautiful and important.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses down and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have memories with them. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like an average American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, kids play outside. It is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt once with an elbow to my nose playing football, but the good times are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and love swings and slides. The park makes them happy. It makes me remember many things. The neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian places. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular here, as in many suburbs. There are also many pizza places. Stores have all you need. There are dry cleaners close by. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store for Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I read stories online about bad neighbors, and I am thankful for mine.",
            "I live near the college I go to, and I like it. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are some restaurants and bars that are fun and not too costly. One bar got a new name. It costs more but is not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have less money because rent is not high. There are many children because an elementary school is close. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building put an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I find funny. It is almost rude. The buildings here look old but may be fixed inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them because the building work was not good. They are made cheap but rent is high, which I think is wrong. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a cheap place to eat five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave food. Next to it is a gas station, which is not a good job place. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk and grass, and it looks nicer. My building has many trees. Some trees were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on that street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at a complex on that street. But there are also problems across from me. But I like where I live. I can pay for it, and there are useful things close by. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are spaced out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. Some evenings, we stand at a driveway and talk while the children play with toys, draw on the sidewalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern world of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds.  \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard a siren and went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my little dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature change. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement.  \n\nAs the sky cleared, the sun came out and it rained. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets were quiet for an hour until people came home after the storm. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. I love this friendly neighborhood after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I enjoy the southern accent here.  \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments are different inside. Some are very small, which I do not understand. I love walking by the big field behind my home and going to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, I hear a big bullfrog singing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even hear a donkey braying at a nearby farm in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with good housing and a better high school. It was not like our old neighborhood.\n\nOver the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They lived right next to us. They are nice people. I almost consider them family and I appreciate them. I remember when my family went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was very fun. I want to have a wedding like that someday. When Ms. Veda took off the white strap from her leg and threw it, I caught it! But I did not catch the flowers. We danced all night. I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I can explore it more. I have gone exploring with my friends Kason and Curtis. We played video games a lot and enjoyed life. Sometimes I go to the park. It makes me feel calm and at peace. I practice balance with sticks I bought from a store. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also basketball and tennis courts. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We always had fun. They worked us hard! I have had a lot of fun in this neighborhood. There are many stories, but these are the ones I remember most. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is like other towns in South Carolina, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on the sign when you enter. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses not in the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. Here, you find the only stores in town. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed recently. There is a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The town has a small, expensive grocery store called IGA. Though it is the only grocery store, many people go to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There is a doctor’s office and a vet's office away from the main town. Both are small but help the people of Johnston. The town has one school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in a nearby town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a 2.5-acre area for recreation. This will give families more places to go and attract more visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town, so small that you might pass by it without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. The town is in the south. Our house is in a quiet area. Our street connects two highways, so we see many cars. But the area is calm. Few people move away, so I know most of the people here. People do work in their yards and other simple jobs. In winter, we sled on a hill near us. Our house is at the corner of the street. We see everyone come and go. We know the cars they drive. If we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes and play. We work from home, so we are often here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. Our daughters are eleven and fourteen. Others are used to us coming and going too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on the back deck. The barbecue smells nice. People cut grass often here. We hear lawn mowers from March to October. There are many trees here. It used to be a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but many leaves fall in Autumn. We rake and burn leaves each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. Lately, Winter is not cold. It feels like a long Fall. Our garage is behind our house. We do not use the front door much. We use it if someone knocks, but that is rare. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the area. It is quiet during holidays. On Thanksgiving, families visit from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it was not a busy street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. Unless someone has lived here, they might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, it means that person spends a lot on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city each day. Most places are changing this way.\n\nMost people here are friendly. But, like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, many friendly old people live. I think it is a nice place. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you must travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that.\n\nMany jobs here are in construction. The city is not very developed, so there are open spaces to build. This scares me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like the different animals here. People come to the high desert because of its beauty. The desert has a special climate and land. It has many animals that need protection. People should learn about these animals to live safely with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. As I write, they are outside catching them.\n\nThere are some attractions here. Victorville is good for families to see the desert. It can be a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and try winter sports.\n\nIf you like natural history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of their own homes, but my situation is not the same. I see my neighborhood as the college campus where I live. The people in my dorm are my community. The area around the campus is also part of my neighborhood, but not as much. Even though this is different, my neighborhood has things in common with other neighborhoods. Like any neighborhood, mine has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each. Then, there are real houses that people with school connections can rent. These are usually 2-4 bedroom houses, often with alumni living in them. There are only a few of these houses because they are not very efficient. Last, there are dorm rooms with hundreds of students. Two people share a room, usually, and these are the most common housing.\n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and this shows in my neighborhood. People from all cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. The people here are interesting, but I will move on to the stores and parks.\n\nMy school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores offer food like any neighborhood and have the school's clothing and grocery stores. You can find anything you need here. The park is a playground for everyone and is kept clean and safe by people in the neighborhood.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be a bit dangerous to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires around the block look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches often fall on the power lines, and the repairs make them look patched. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high on the hill, with big glass-fronted second stories to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. It is cloudy most of the time, though, so you often see the sun through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in my driveway for a month, and when I wanted to use it, it was green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There are not many children around, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some are big, and gardeners hate them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have many birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until crows chase it away. There are no stores around, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the opposite shore clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transportation is very good. Many people use it in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city area, so it feels like New York City. \n\nWhen you visit, you will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. Because of this, you will see an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very popular. The food in the supermarkets is very good, the prices are low, and it is very convenient. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other. This makes grocery shopping easy.\n\nBensonhurst is not only Asian. It is a mix of many people. There are immigrants and their children. Many big businesses here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park nearby. The park has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The parks are diverse, and people get along well.\n\nThere are not many big corporate buildings here. You will find co-op buildings and condo apartments. Most people live in two-family houses. People are nice but can be noisy. You hear cars with loud music and engines in the morning.\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but people can be unpredictable. Some may cause trouble. I have been bullied here in the past, but it was long ago. Package theft is also a problem.\n\nEven though there is a fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people do not always follow this rule. You often see dog waste on the way to the train or supermarket. Watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "In Portland, Oregon, the word \"weird\" has a special meaning. The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this on a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and more. For some, this slogan asks people to remember the old Portland of the 90s and early 2000s. Back then, the city was less known and cheaper, with creative groups. For others, it invites people to come to Portland, where being called weird is a good thing. \n\nEven with many new people from California and new buildings for them, Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that are not usually accepted. It does not mean we do not have modern things. We still buy most of our stuff from China, like the rest of the country. \n\nThere are many ways to be weird or not normal, but Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes in summer. Free boxes can be cardboard or plastic and hold stuff people don't want. Often, they have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood can be like finding a treasure. \n\nThis is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many. Some people never take clothes from a box on the street. They prefer goat yoga, which is yoga with real goats, or watching the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland has people who love different things. We try to follow our dreams or just think about them while at the bar. \n\nYes, Portland has a drug problem, often linked to mental health issues. The rain and gray clouds might be part of the reason. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many homeless people come for the social services, which are better here than in most places, but still not enough. People in Portland feel both care and dislike for the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set. I often forget them because I am busy. But they are always there. They do not change. When I feel stressed, I look at them. They help me feel strong. I moved here for college. The mountains were the first thing I loved. The university has nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is beautiful. There are many cafés. I studied there a lot. You can walk or take the bus downtown. There are old buildings with faded bricks. This part of town feels busy like a city. But it is not big. You can go back to the quiet town by passing the library. The city feels like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. You might walk with friends after staying up all night. Or you might rush downtown to see a movie. The university gave us tickets. But there are also sad memories. All places have them. The ponds are good for thinking or crying at night. I know this well. I watched the turtles, ducks, and insects. They all have a role. I thought about my own life. I walked past the pond and park. Past the small houses. Then I reached a main street. The sun shone on the palm trees. I looked at the sunrise. I saw I was walking north. The mountains were there. They touched the sky. More than any building. They spoke to me without words. They made me feel strong.",
            "At first, you might not notice this area. It is a place behind a shopping strip. It does not seem like a place where people live. But if you walk behind the old Whole Foods and past the hotels, you will find a busy community. The hotels are busy only in summer for family reunions. On these streets, there are many apartment buildings. They sit next to each other like Russian dolls placed in a line. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk much about them. But the apartments next to them are different. Few people know about them. Across from these buildings is a quiet campus of a community college. Students come there early in the morning with coffee. The gates open to let them in one by one. People in cars complain about traffic when many students attend. The road meets another road with a park on one side and a center for people who need help after injuries. The center has chairs on the porch and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park across the street. They run and play among the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. Teen girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube stars. There is a sushi place in a strip mall by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store that sells swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken all at the same place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens get yogurt with toppings. They eat it while skateboarding and vaping because they think it is cool. This neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. It is like most others here. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced our country, but now it is fading. Yet, my neighborhood and many others are still here. They show that the dream is still alive. We hold onto it as best we can. People are not as hopeful as before. The yards are not kept as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. Children play as if their world is everything. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It is still here. It gives hope to the youth and brings old memories to older people. There are few churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people here are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football and stop when cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy. People say drugs make everything better. There is a small movie theater that plays old movies at a lower price. The young do not like it because it lacks new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out, without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exits are in the next town. There was once a petition for an exit here. The young wanted it, but the elders did not. They said an expressway would ruin our town. The city council agreed. They are building a new high school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best show what my town is like.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are mixed with business areas. Many businesses are here. Some have offices. Others are stores, restaurants, or places for fun. There are always new restaurants and shops. Some stores are big and famous. Small shops are popular too. They are in malls and also on streets near homes. These streets are close enough to walk to and can be busy. We also have parks nearby. People often go there with their children.  \n\nThere are many kinds of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They often live in their own areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are only a few miles away. But driving can take a long time because of traffic. It can take two hours to go just 10 miles during rush hour.  \n\nMany people do not walk much in my city. Even if places are close, the city is large. People prefer driving. We have some of the worst traffic in the world. Parking is hard to find. Many new big apartment buildings are being built. This city is popular, but some people do not like more people and cars coming in.  \n\nThere are many types of homes here. Not everyone wants to live in a big apartment building. Some live in houses or small apartment buildings. Some homes are for one family. Others are duplexes. In my area, there are many kinds of homes. There are also people of many ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. The community is not as close as before. But I remember playing outside with my neighbors and friends when I was a child.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She lived in a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. Then she knew more about me and where I came from. We drove on a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Just past it is my small neighborhood. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land. People take care of their land. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars that shine in the sun. As we go to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is outside. He smiles and mows his lawn. He sings while he mows. People in the neighborhood like him. He is kind and has an interesting past. He was a doctor. Now he blends in with the grass and his mower. We reach my home. In the yard, there are many geese. Our Terrier chases them. Behind the house is a small stream. It goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes you hear cows from the farms. Across a wood bridge is a wild place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much time here as a child. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters in my town can be very cold but also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When snow falls, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts with branches. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without worries."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. Here, you see farmland and small cities where people visit. There are no big malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place with water all around. My town is near water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach everywhere you go. \n\nMy neighborhood looks like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some are old, some are updated. Most houses have basements. You can see these basements from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are houses in every color you can think of. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. Hard-working people live here. They make a living and raise families. \n\nAny day, you see kids running in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who belongs and who does not. You wave to someone grilling outside or smile at someone walking a dog. Lawns are kept neat. Leaves are not left from fall. Grass is green and cut. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It looks average, but it is special because it is a safe place to end your day. \n\nNearby, there is the sheriff’s department and jail. The health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields. You can hear announcers call names and scores. Our small airport is nearby. You hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk downtown from here. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association here. Because of this, the houses are well-kept. The front yards look similar. There is some grass, some stones, and short driveways. You might also see small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the roads. Most houses have one floor, some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. People use keys to open their mailbox. There are also two large boxes for packages. My house is at the edge of the city, so we have both land and suburb. There are many pools here. People living here can use them. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking paths. You can walk your dog or walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to walk or run. The area is safe. Many people who live here are retired. Some are middle-aged or young workers. The city nearby is large in people but small in feel. It has most things you need. There is one mall. It is small but enough. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to places. There are many stores to choose from. We have grocery stores that sell organic food. We also have discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and paths. We are not close to shopping, but a short drive gets you to many stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It was about people who went missing. This surprised me. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I never heard that story before, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. I know some of my friends cry when they go to sleep. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over time. We like the dusty smell of old toys and clothes. You smell less as an adult. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to it. But the flea market smell stays. The smell of being an adult is like dusty magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but the stores are quiet. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store stays silent. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is the home of one of the largest online companies for shopping and delivery, but it still has growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has goals, and not much is asked from you. You can be alone and quiet, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means you ask questions. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you want, and the city moves like waves on a beach. It is a lively place. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something going on. In a way, we are not strangers but more like friends. We come together when needed, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a big, modern place, but my neighbors make me feel like I made a good choice.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not rich. Houses cost less here. Many people rent or own these homes, and they do not have much money. But the place is nice. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is not high here, just a bit more than other parts of town. In the last ten years, there have been a few violent crimes near my home. A few shootings happened, and one person was killed. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been hurt by crime, except sometimes things disappear from our porch when we forget to bring them in. \n\nThe town has been hit hard by the “opioid epidemic” in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are many resources to fight this problem. We have several places for addiction help and Narcan training for families. Despite these problems, there are good things here. My son’s school is very good. The principal, teachers, and staff are all excellent. My son has special needs, but he has not been bullied at school. He loves it there. The school has a strong PTO that plans many events to involve families and help students learn. Because more than 20% of people in our town are poor, the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child goes hungry. No one is treated as less important because they cannot pay. School costs are fair for everyone.\n\nThe City Council has made many changes to make our town look better. They fix roads, plant flowers, and improve parks. But most of these changes are in the center of town and on the west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often left out. People in my neighborhood are unhappy about this. \n\nOverall, I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough shops. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice and enough for us. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture. It is on a hill and old buildings are around it. I live in an apartment building with 7 floors. It is across from the old live Theater. A block down the hill is a small, fun arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. In June and July, you will often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete with tall stairs in the wall. In winter, homeless people set up their tents in rows on the sidewalk and the wide steps. It does not snow much, but it rains hard in mid-winter. This makes it hard to stay warm. They set their tents close together. This keeps them warmer. They are also close to the family center where they can bathe. What I love about my city is not just the old buildings but the culture of the people. Hilltop once had much gang violence. People still talk about when the government tried to clean the streets. People remember those times. They work hard to keep it nice even if it is still a tough area. They care about their city and their block. Some say if you are white, do not walk around Hilltop after dark. I think this is from the past. Maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know Hilltop is home for me. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are more likely to offer help than harm. It is a place where laundromat owners stay open so I can charge my phone. It is a place where when I feel alone, someone stops and tells me I am beautiful and important.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses down and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have memories with them. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like an average American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, kids play outside. It is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt once with an elbow to my nose playing football, but the good times are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and love swings and slides. The park makes them happy. It makes me remember many things. The neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian places. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular here, as in many suburbs. There are also many pizza places. Stores have all you need. There are dry cleaners close by. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store for Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I read stories online about bad neighbors, and I am thankful for mine.",
            "I live near the college I go to, and I like it. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are some restaurants and bars that are fun and not too costly. One bar got a new name. It costs more but is not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have less money because rent is not high. There are many children because an elementary school is close. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building put an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I find funny. It is almost rude. The buildings here look old but may be fixed inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them because the building work was not good. They are made cheap but rent is high, which I think is wrong. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a cheap place to eat five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave food. Next to it is a gas station, which is not a good job place. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk and grass, and it looks nicer. My building has many trees. Some trees were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on that street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at a complex on that street. But there are also problems across from me. But I like where I live. I can pay for it, and there are useful things close by. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are spaced out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. Some evenings, we stand at a driveway and talk while the children play with toys, draw on the sidewalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern world of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds.  \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard a siren and went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my little dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature change. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement.  \n\nAs the sky cleared, the sun came out and it rained. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets were quiet for an hour until people came home after the storm. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. I love this friendly neighborhood after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I enjoy the southern accent here.  \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments are different inside. Some are very small, which I do not understand. I love walking by the big field behind my home and going to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, I hear a big bullfrog singing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even hear a donkey braying at a nearby farm in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with good housing and a better high school. It was not like our old neighborhood.\n\nOver the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They lived right next to us. They are nice people. I almost consider them family and I appreciate them. I remember when my family went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was very fun. I want to have a wedding like that someday. When Ms. Veda took off the white strap from her leg and threw it, I caught it! But I did not catch the flowers. We danced all night. I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I can explore it more. I have gone exploring with my friends Kason and Curtis. We played video games a lot and enjoyed life. Sometimes I go to the park. It makes me feel calm and at peace. I practice balance with sticks I bought from a store. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also basketball and tennis courts. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We always had fun. They worked us hard! I have had a lot of fun in this neighborhood. There are many stories, but these are the ones I remember most. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is like other towns in South Carolina, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on the sign when you enter. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses not in the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. Here, you find the only stores in town. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed recently. There is a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The town has a small, expensive grocery store called IGA. Though it is the only grocery store, many people go to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There is a doctor’s office and a vet's office away from the main town. Both are small but help the people of Johnston. The town has one school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in a nearby town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a 2.5-acre area for recreation. This will give families more places to go and attract more visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town, so small that you might pass by it without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. The town is in the south. Our house is in a quiet area. Our street connects two highways, so we see many cars. But the area is calm. Few people move away, so I know most of the people here. People do work in their yards and other simple jobs. In winter, we sled on a hill near us. Our house is at the corner of the street. We see everyone come and go. We know the cars they drive. If we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes and play. We work from home, so we are often here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. Our daughters are eleven and fourteen. Others are used to us coming and going too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on the back deck. The barbecue smells nice. People cut grass often here. We hear lawn mowers from March to October. There are many trees here. It used to be a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but many leaves fall in Autumn. We rake and burn leaves each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. Lately, Winter is not cold. It feels like a long Fall. Our garage is behind our house. We do not use the front door much. We use it if someone knocks, but that is rare. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the area. It is quiet during holidays. On Thanksgiving, families visit from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it was not a busy street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. Unless someone has lived here, they might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, it means that person spends a lot on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city each day. Most places are changing this way.\n\nMost people here are friendly. But, like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, many friendly old people live. I think it is a nice place. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you must travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that.\n\nMany jobs here are in construction. The city is not very developed, so there are open spaces to build. This scares me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like the different animals here. People come to the high desert because of its beauty. The desert has a special climate and land. It has many animals that need protection. People should learn about these animals to live safely with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. As I write, they are outside catching them.\n\nThere are some attractions here. Victorville is good for families to see the desert. It can be a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and try winter sports.\n\nIf you like natural history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of their own homes, but my situation is not the same. I see my neighborhood as the college campus where I live. The people in my dorm are my community. The area around the campus is also part of my neighborhood, but not as much. Even though this is different, my neighborhood has things in common with other neighborhoods. Like any neighborhood, mine has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each. Then, there are real houses that people with school connections can rent. These are usually 2-4 bedroom houses, often with alumni living in them. There are only a few of these houses because they are not very efficient. Last, there are dorm rooms with hundreds of students. Two people share a room, usually, and these are the most common housing.\n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and this shows in my neighborhood. People from all cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. The people here are interesting, but I will move on to the stores and parks.\n\nMy school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores offer food like any neighborhood and have the school's clothing and grocery stores. You can find anything you need here. The park is a playground for everyone and is kept clean and safe by people in the neighborhood.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be a bit dangerous to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires around the block look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches often fall on the power lines, and the repairs make them look patched. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high on the hill, with big glass-fronted second stories to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. It is cloudy most of the time, though, so you often see the sun through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in my driveway for a month, and when I wanted to use it, it was green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There are not many children around, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some are big, and gardeners hate them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have many birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until crows chase it away. There are no stores around, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the opposite shore clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transportation is very good. Many people use it in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city area, so it feels like New York City. \n\nWhen you visit, you will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. Because of this, you will see an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very popular. The food in the supermarkets is very good, the prices are low, and it is very convenient. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other. This makes grocery shopping easy.\n\nBensonhurst is not only Asian. It is a mix of many people. There are immigrants and their children. Many big businesses here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park nearby. The park has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The parks are diverse, and people get along well.\n\nThere are not many big corporate buildings here. You will find co-op buildings and condo apartments. Most people live in two-family houses. People are nice but can be noisy. You hear cars with loud music and engines in the morning.\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but people can be unpredictable. Some may cause trouble. I have been bullied here in the past, but it was long ago. Package theft is also a problem.\n\nEven though there is a fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people do not always follow this rule. You often see dog waste on the way to the train or supermarket. Watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "In Portland, Oregon, the word \"weird\" has a special meaning. The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this on a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and more. For some, this slogan asks people to remember the old Portland of the 90s and early 2000s. Back then, the city was less known and cheaper, with creative groups. For others, it invites people to come to Portland, where being called weird is a good thing. \n\nEven with many new people from California and new buildings for them, Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that are not usually accepted. It does not mean we do not have modern things. We still buy most of our stuff from China, like the rest of the country. \n\nThere are many ways to be weird or not normal, but Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes in summer. Free boxes can be cardboard or plastic and hold stuff people don't want. Often, they have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood can be like finding a treasure. \n\nThis is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many. Some people never take clothes from a box on the street. They prefer goat yoga, which is yoga with real goats, or watching the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland has people who love different things. We try to follow our dreams or just think about them while at the bar. \n\nYes, Portland has a drug problem, often linked to mental health issues. The rain and gray clouds might be part of the reason. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many homeless people come for the social services, which are better here than in most places, but still not enough. People in Portland feel both care and dislike for the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set. I often forget them because I am busy. But they are always there. They do not change. When I feel stressed, I look at them. They help me feel strong. I moved here for college. The mountains were the first thing I loved. The university has nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is beautiful. There are many cafés. I studied there a lot. You can walk or take the bus downtown. There are old buildings with faded bricks. This part of town feels busy like a city. But it is not big. You can go back to the quiet town by passing the library. The city feels like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. You might walk with friends after staying up all night. Or you might rush downtown to see a movie. The university gave us tickets. But there are also sad memories. All places have them. The ponds are good for thinking or crying at night. I know this well. I watched the turtles, ducks, and insects. They all have a role. I thought about my own life. I walked past the pond and park. Past the small houses. Then I reached a main street. The sun shone on the palm trees. I looked at the sunrise. I saw I was walking north. The mountains were there. They touched the sky. More than any building. They spoke to me without words. They made me feel strong.",
            "At first, you might not notice this area. It is a place behind a shopping strip. It does not seem like a place where people live. But if you walk behind the old Whole Foods and past the hotels, you will find a busy community. The hotels are busy only in summer for family reunions. On these streets, there are many apartment buildings. They sit next to each other like Russian dolls placed in a line. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk much about them. But the apartments next to them are different. Few people know about them. Across from these buildings is a quiet campus of a community college. Students come there early in the morning with coffee. The gates open to let them in one by one. People in cars complain about traffic when many students attend. The road meets another road with a park on one side and a center for people who need help after injuries. The center has chairs on the porch and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park across the street. They run and play among the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. Teen girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube stars. There is a sushi place in a strip mall by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store that sells swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken all at the same place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens get yogurt with toppings. They eat it while skateboarding and vaping because they think it is cool. This neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. It is like most others here. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced our country, but now it is fading. Yet, my neighborhood and many others are still here. They show that the dream is still alive. We hold onto it as best we can. People are not as hopeful as before. The yards are not kept as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. Children play as if their world is everything. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It is still here. It gives hope to the youth and brings old memories to older people. There are few churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people here are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football and stop when cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy. People say drugs make everything better. There is a small movie theater that plays old movies at a lower price. The young do not like it because it lacks new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out, without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exits are in the next town. There was once a petition for an exit here. The young wanted it, but the elders did not. They said an expressway would ruin our town. The city council agreed. They are building a new high school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best show what my town is like.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are mixed with business areas. Many businesses are here. Some have offices. Others are stores, restaurants, or places for fun. There are always new restaurants and shops. Some stores are big and famous. Small shops are popular too. They are in malls and also on streets near homes. These streets are close enough to walk to and can be busy. We also have parks nearby. People often go there with their children.  \n\nThere are many kinds of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They often live in their own areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are only a few miles away. But driving can take a long time because of traffic. It can take two hours to go just 10 miles during rush hour.  \n\nMany people do not walk much in my city. Even if places are close, the city is large. People prefer driving. We have some of the worst traffic in the world. Parking is hard to find. Many new big apartment buildings are being built. This city is popular, but some people do not like more people and cars coming in.  \n\nThere are many types of homes here. Not everyone wants to live in a big apartment building. Some live in houses or small apartment buildings. Some homes are for one family. Others are duplexes. In my area, there are many kinds of homes. There are also people of many ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. The community is not as close as before. But I remember playing outside with my neighbors and friends when I was a child.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She lived in a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. Then she knew more about me and where I came from. We drove on a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Just past it is my small neighborhood. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land. People take care of their land. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars that shine in the sun. As we go to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is outside. He smiles and mows his lawn. He sings while he mows. People in the neighborhood like him. He is kind and has an interesting past. He was a doctor. Now he blends in with the grass and his mower. We reach my home. In the yard, there are many geese. Our Terrier chases them. Behind the house is a small stream. It goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes you hear cows from the farms. Across a wood bridge is a wild place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much time here as a child. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters in my town can be very cold but also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When snow falls, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts with branches. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without worries."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. Here, you see farmland and small cities where people visit. There are no big malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place with water all around. My town is near water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach everywhere you go. \n\nMy neighborhood looks like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some are old, some are updated. Most houses have basements. You can see these basements from the road. Many houses have aluminum siding. There are houses in every color you can think of. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. Hard-working people live here. They make a living and raise families. \n\nAny day, you see kids running in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who belongs and who does not. You wave to someone grilling outside or smile at someone walking a dog. Lawns are kept neat. Leaves are not left from fall. Grass is green and cut. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It looks average, but it is special because it is a safe place to end your day. \n\nNearby, there is the sheriff’s department and jail. The health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields. You can hear announcers call names and scores. Our small airport is nearby. You hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk downtown from here. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association here. Because of this, the houses are well-kept. The front yards look similar. There is some grass, some stones, and short driveways. You might also see small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the roads. Most houses have one floor, some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. People use keys to open their mailbox. There are also two large boxes for packages. My house is at the edge of the city, so we have both land and suburb. There are many pools here. People living here can use them. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking paths. You can walk your dog or walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to walk or run. The area is safe. Many people who live here are retired. Some are middle-aged or young workers. The city nearby is large in people but small in feel. It has most things you need. There is one mall. It is small but enough. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to places. There are many stores to choose from. We have grocery stores that sell organic food. We also have discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and paths. We are not close to shopping, but a short drive gets you to many stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It was about people who went missing. This surprised me. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I never heard that story before, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. I know some of my friends cry when they go to sleep. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over time. We like the dusty smell of old toys and clothes. You smell less as an adult. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to it. But the flea market smell stays. The smell of being an adult is like dusty magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but the stores are quiet. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store stays silent. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is the home of one of the largest online companies for shopping and delivery, but it still has growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has goals, and not much is asked from you. You can be alone and quiet, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means you ask questions. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you want, and the city moves like waves on a beach. It is a lively place. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something going on. In a way, we are not strangers but more like friends. We come together when needed, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a big, modern place, but my neighbors make me feel like I made a good choice.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not rich. Houses cost less here. Many people rent or own these homes, and they do not have much money. But the place is nice. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is not high here, just a bit more than other parts of town. In the last ten years, there have been a few violent crimes near my home. A few shootings happened, and one person was killed. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been hurt by crime, except sometimes things disappear from our porch when we forget to bring them in. \n\nThe town has been hit hard by the “opioid epidemic” in the United States. Many people have died from fentanyl overdoses. But there are many resources to fight this problem. We have several places for addiction help and Narcan training for families. Despite these problems, there are good things here. My son’s school is very good. The principal, teachers, and staff are all excellent. My son has special needs, but he has not been bullied at school. He loves it there. The school has a strong PTO that plans many events to involve families and help students learn. Because more than 20% of people in our town are poor, the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child goes hungry. No one is treated as less important because they cannot pay. School costs are fair for everyone.\n\nThe City Council has made many changes to make our town look better. They fix roads, plant flowers, and improve parks. But most of these changes are in the center of town and on the west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often left out. People in my neighborhood are unhappy about this. \n\nOverall, I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have enough shops. Our home is not worth much, but it is nice and enough for us. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot think of living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich with culture. It is on a hill and old buildings are around it. I live in an apartment building with 7 floors. It is across from the old live Theater. A block down the hill is a small, fun arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. In June and July, you will often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the city park. It is big for this part of town. The park is surrounded by concrete with tall stairs in the wall. In winter, homeless people set up their tents in rows on the sidewalk and the wide steps. It does not snow much, but it rains hard in mid-winter. This makes it hard to stay warm. They set their tents close together. This keeps them warmer. They are also close to the family center where they can bathe. What I love about my city is not just the old buildings but the culture of the people. Hilltop once had much gang violence. People still talk about when the government tried to clean the streets. People remember those times. They work hard to keep it nice even if it is still a tough area. They care about their city and their block. Some say if you are white, do not walk around Hilltop after dark. I think this is from the past. Maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know Hilltop is home for me. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are more likely to offer help than harm. It is a place where laundromat owners stay open so I can charge my phone. It is a place where when I feel alone, someone stops and tells me I am beautiful and important.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses down and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have memories with them. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like an average American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, kids play outside. It is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt once with an elbow to my nose playing football, but the good times are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and love swings and slides. The park makes them happy. It makes me remember many things. The neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian places. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular here, as in many suburbs. There are also many pizza places. Stores have all you need. There are dry cleaners close by. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store for Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I read stories online about bad neighbors, and I am thankful for mine.",
            "I live near the college I go to, and I like it. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are some restaurants and bars that are fun and not too costly. One bar got a new name. It costs more but is not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have less money because rent is not high. There are many children because an elementary school is close. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building put an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I find funny. It is almost rude. The buildings here look old but may be fixed inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them because the building work was not good. They are made cheap but rent is high, which I think is wrong. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a cheap place to eat five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave food. Next to it is a gas station, which is not a good job place. But the city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a big sidewalk and grass, and it looks nicer. My building has many trees. Some trees were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on that street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at a complex on that street. But there are also problems across from me. But I like where I live. I can pay for it, and there are useful things close by. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are spaced out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. Some evenings, we stand at a driveway and talk while the children play with toys, draw on the sidewalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern world of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds.  \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard a siren and went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my little dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature change. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement.  \n\nAs the sky cleared, the sun came out and it rained. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets were quiet for an hour until people came home after the storm. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. I love this friendly neighborhood after moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I enjoy the southern accent here.  \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments are different inside. Some are very small, which I do not understand. I love walking by the big field behind my home and going to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, I hear a big bullfrog singing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even hear a donkey braying at a nearby farm in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. We moved to a better place with good housing and a better high school. It was not like our old neighborhood.\n\nOver the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They lived right next to us. They are nice people. I almost consider them family and I appreciate them. I remember when my family went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was very fun. I want to have a wedding like that someday. When Ms. Veda took off the white strap from her leg and threw it, I caught it! But I did not catch the flowers. We danced all night. I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I can explore it more. I have gone exploring with my friends Kason and Curtis. We played video games a lot and enjoyed life. Sometimes I go to the park. It makes me feel calm and at peace. I practice balance with sticks I bought from a store. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are also basketball and tennis courts. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We always had fun. They worked us hard! I have had a lot of fun in this neighborhood. There are many stories, but these are the ones I remember most. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is like other towns in South Carolina, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on the sign when you enter. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses not in the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are set back from the road, leaving space in front for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. Here, you find the only stores in town. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed recently. There is a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The town has a small, expensive grocery store called IGA. Though it is the only grocery store, many people go to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It is run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a small pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There is a doctor’s office and a vet's office away from the main town. Both are small but help the people of Johnston. The town has one school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in a nearby town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a 2.5-acre area for recreation. This will give families more places to go and attract more visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town, so small that you might pass by it without noticing!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. The town is in the south. Our house is in a quiet area. Our street connects two highways, so we see many cars. But the area is calm. Few people move away, so I know most of the people here. People do work in their yards and other simple jobs. In winter, we sled on a hill near us. Our house is at the corner of the street. We see everyone come and go. We know the cars they drive. If we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes and play. We work from home, so we are often here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. Our daughters are eleven and fourteen. Others are used to us coming and going too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on the back deck. The barbecue smells nice. People cut grass often here. We hear lawn mowers from March to October. There are many trees here. It used to be a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but many leaves fall in Autumn. We rake and burn leaves each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. Lately, Winter is not cold. It feels like a long Fall. Our garage is behind our house. We do not use the front door much. We use it if someone knocks, but that is rare. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the area. It is quiet during holidays. On Thanksgiving, families visit from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it was not a busy street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. Unless someone has lived here, they might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, it means that person spends a lot on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city each day. Most places are changing this way.\n\nMost people here are friendly. But, like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, many friendly old people live. I think it is a nice place. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you must travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that.\n\nMany jobs here are in construction. The city is not very developed, so there are open spaces to build. This scares me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like the different animals here. People come to the high desert because of its beauty. The desert has a special climate and land. It has many animals that need protection. People should learn about these animals to live safely with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. As I write, they are outside catching them.\n\nThere are some attractions here. Victorville is good for families to see the desert. It can be a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and try winter sports.\n\nIf you like natural history and culture, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These tell the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Most people think of their own homes, but my situation is not the same. I see my neighborhood as the college campus where I live. The people in my dorm are my community. The area around the campus is also part of my neighborhood, but not as much. Even though this is different, my neighborhood has things in common with other neighborhoods. Like any neighborhood, mine has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each. Then, there are real houses that people with school connections can rent. These are usually 2-4 bedroom houses, often with alumni living in them. There are only a few of these houses because they are not very efficient. Last, there are dorm rooms with hundreds of students. Two people share a room, usually, and these are the most common housing.\n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity, and this shows in my neighborhood. People from all cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments. The people here are interesting, but I will move on to the stores and parks.\n\nMy school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores offer food like any neighborhood and have the school's clothing and grocery stores. You can find anything you need here. The park is a playground for everyone and is kept clean and safe by people in the neighborhood.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downhill, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be a bit dangerous to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires around the block look old and worn. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches often fall on the power lines, and the repairs make them look patched. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high on the hill, with big glass-fronted second stories to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. It is cloudy most of the time, though, so you often see the sun through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in my driveway for a month, and when I wanted to use it, it was green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There are not many children around, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room and had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some are big, and gardeners hate them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also have many birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until crows chase it away. There are no stores around, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the opposite shore clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transportation is very good. Many people use it in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city area, so it feels like New York City. \n\nWhen you visit, you will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. Because of this, you will see an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are very popular. The food in the supermarkets is very good, the prices are low, and it is very convenient. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other. This makes grocery shopping easy.\n\nBensonhurst is not only Asian. It is a mix of many people. There are immigrants and their children. Many big businesses here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park nearby. The park has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. The parks are diverse, and people get along well.\n\nThere are not many big corporate buildings here. You will find co-op buildings and condo apartments. Most people live in two-family houses. People are nice but can be noisy. You hear cars with loud music and engines in the morning.\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. This area is safe, but people can be unpredictable. Some may cause trouble. I have been bullied here in the past, but it was long ago. Package theft is also a problem.\n\nEven though there is a fine for not cleaning up after dogs, people do not always follow this rule. You often see dog waste on the way to the train or supermarket. Watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "In Portland, Oregon, the word \"weird\" has a special meaning. The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this on a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and more. For some, this slogan asks people to remember the old Portland of the 90s and early 2000s. Back then, the city was less known and cheaper, with creative groups. For others, it invites people to come to Portland, where being called weird is a good thing. \n\nEven with many new people from California and new buildings for them, Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that are not usually accepted. It does not mean we do not have modern things. We still buy most of our stuff from China, like the rest of the country. \n\nThere are many ways to be weird or not normal, but Portland has normal things too. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, like many in Portland, we have colorful houses, gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes in summer. Free boxes can be cardboard or plastic and hold stuff people don't want. Often, they have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood can be like finding a treasure. \n\nThis is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many. Some people never take clothes from a box on the street. They prefer goat yoga, which is yoga with real goats, or watching the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland has people who love different things. We try to follow our dreams or just think about them while at the bar. \n\nYes, Portland has a drug problem, often linked to mental health issues. The rain and gray clouds might be part of the reason. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many homeless people come for the social services, which are better here than in most places, but still not enough. People in Portland feel both care and dislike for the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun rise and set. I often forget them because I am busy. But they are always there. They do not change. When I feel stressed, I look at them. They help me feel strong. I moved here for college. The mountains were the first thing I loved. The university has nice buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is beautiful. There are many cafés. I studied there a lot. You can walk or take the bus downtown. There are old buildings with faded bricks. This part of town feels busy like a city. But it is not big. You can go back to the quiet town by passing the library. The city feels like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. You might walk with friends after staying up all night. Or you might rush downtown to see a movie. The university gave us tickets. But there are also sad memories. All places have them. The ponds are good for thinking or crying at night. I know this well. I watched the turtles, ducks, and insects. They all have a role. I thought about my own life. I walked past the pond and park. Past the small houses. Then I reached a main street. The sun shone on the palm trees. I looked at the sunrise. I saw I was walking north. The mountains were there. They touched the sky. More than any building. They spoke to me without words. They made me feel strong.",
            "At first, you might not notice this area. It is a place behind a shopping strip. It does not seem like a place where people live. But if you walk behind the old Whole Foods and past the hotels, you will find a busy community. The hotels are busy only in summer for family reunions. On these streets, there are many apartment buildings. They sit next to each other like Russian dolls placed in a line. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk much about them. But the apartments next to them are different. Few people know about them. Across from these buildings is a quiet campus of a community college. Students come there early in the morning with coffee. The gates open to let them in one by one. People in cars complain about traffic when many students attend. The road meets another road with a park on one side and a center for people who need help after injuries. The center has chairs on the porch and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park across the street. They run and play among the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and watch the teenagers on skateboards. Teen girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube stars. There is a sushi place in a strip mall by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store that sells swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken all at the same place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where teens get yogurt with toppings. They eat it while skateboarding and vaping because they think it is cool. This neighborhood is like a piece of America. It is in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the left. It is like most others here. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced our country, but now it is fading. Yet, my neighborhood and many others are still here. They show that the dream is still alive. We hold onto it as best we can. People are not as hopeful as before. The yards are not kept as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. Children play as if their world is everything. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It is still here. It gives hope to the youth and brings old memories to older people. There are few churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". It is owned by a large Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people here are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football and stop when cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They tell stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids lost interest. Now it is a pharmacy. People say drugs make everything better. There is a small movie theater that plays old movies at a lower price. The young do not like it because it lacks new movies. But older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out, without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exits are in the next town. There was once a petition for an exit here. The young wanted it, but the elders did not. They said an expressway would ruin our town. The city council agreed. They are building a new high school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best show what my town is like.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Homes are mixed with business areas. Many businesses are here. Some have offices. Others are stores, restaurants, or places for fun. There are always new restaurants and shops. Some stores are big and famous. Small shops are popular too. They are in malls and also on streets near homes. These streets are close enough to walk to and can be busy. We also have parks nearby. People often go there with their children.  \n\nThere are many kinds of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They often live in their own areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are only a few miles away. But driving can take a long time because of traffic. It can take two hours to go just 10 miles during rush hour.  \n\nMany people do not walk much in my city. Even if places are close, the city is large. People prefer driving. We have some of the worst traffic in the world. Parking is hard to find. Many new big apartment buildings are being built. This city is popular, but some people do not like more people and cars coming in.  \n\nThere are many types of homes here. Not everyone wants to live in a big apartment building. Some live in houses or small apartment buildings. Some homes are for one family. Others are duplexes. In my area, there are many kinds of homes. There are also people of many ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. The community is not as close as before. But I remember playing outside with my neighbors and friends when I was a child.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She lived in a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. Then she knew more about me and where I came from. We drove on a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Just past it is my small neighborhood. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land. People take care of their land. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars that shine in the sun. As we go to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is outside. He smiles and mows his lawn. He sings while he mows. People in the neighborhood like him. He is kind and has an interesting past. He was a doctor. Now he blends in with the grass and his mower. We reach my home. In the yard, there are many geese. Our Terrier chases them. Behind the house is a small stream. It goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes you hear cows from the farms. Across a wood bridge is a wild place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much time here as a child. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters in my town can be very cold but also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When snow falls, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts with branches. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without worries."
