            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You move from farmland to small cities for visitors. There are no big city stores like malls, Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive everywhere you need to go. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you look, there is a beach to enjoy. \n\nMy neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old and some are being fixed up. Most homes have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Many houses have older metal siding. Houses are many different colors. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. People work hard for a living and raise families. Kids play in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and skate. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. People wave to each other and smile. \n\nLawns are kept nice. No one has leaves from fall. Grass is green and cut. If there are plants and bushes, they are trimmed. The neighborhood may not look special, but it feels like a good place for families. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It shows what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. \n\nNearby is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields close by. You can hear the announcers call the game. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. \n\nYou can walk to buy ice cream from a local shop. You can also go downtown from the neighborhood. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association in my neighborhood. Because of this, the homes are well-kept. Front yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some yards have small trees. All houses have two-car garages. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one-story, but some are two-story. Mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to open our mailboxes. There are also two lockers for packages. This is due to the homeowner's association. My house is on the edge of the city. So, the area is part rural, part suburb. We have a lot of land. There are pools for people who live here. They are clean and gated. There are trails for walking dogs or walking alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place, and people care for each other. There are some middle-aged and young workers too. The city is large by population but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is fine. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to important places. There, I find many stores. We have high-end groceries with organic food. We also have bargain stores with a few items and low costs. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you want.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a show about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over the years. You start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. You notice smells less when you are older. You might start to smoke, or maybe you just get used to how things are. The flea market smell is strong. The smell of being an adult is dusty papers on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you wash it. Here, there are 3 thrift stores you can walk to. If you start at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. Even with many cars and people, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a large online trade and delivery company. It is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone follows their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and free, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we are less strangers and more like a group of friends. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave them food; they do the same for me. I bring them mail, and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy seeing me too. I live in a big, modern area, but people like my neighbors make me feel like my life is good.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My part of town is on the east side. It is not a rich area. Many people here have low income. Most houses are rented or owned by people with little money. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are nice. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit more common than in other parts of town, but not too much. There have been some violent crimes nearby in the last ten years, like shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. Our family has been lucky, with only small things taken from our porch. The town has been hit hard by the \"opioid epidemic,\" like many places in the United States. Many have died from drug overdoses. But there are resources here to help, like rehab centers and training for families of drug users. Despite these problems, my town has good points. My son’s school is great. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is welcoming. He loves it there. The PTO plans many events to get families involved. Over 20% of people in town are poor, so the school gives free meals to all students. No child goes hungry, and fees are kept low. The City Council has improved the town’s look by fixing roads, adding plants, and fixing parks. Sadly, these changes are mostly in the center and west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often ignored, which bothers us. Still, I like living here. People are friendly, schools are good, and there are enough stores for us. Our home may not be worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot think of living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from an old theater. A block down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. During weekends in June and July, there is often a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete, with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near a family center where they can wash. \n\nI love my city not for the old buildings or their beauty. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. Even now, people tell stories about those days. They remember when the government tried to clean the streets. People work hard to keep it clean. They still care about their city and block. People say that if you are white, you should not walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is from the old days. Maybe I am dark enough to not look all white, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city meant to be a cultural mix. But I know Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are kind and help each other. Laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone. People tell me I am beautiful and valuable, even on the greyest nights.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have good memories. Most people who lived here when I came are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but the good memories are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are young and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park now makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food is popular, and there are many pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian-owned store for Indian food. \n\nI like my neighborhood. I feel grateful when I hear stories about bad neighbors on social media or the news.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar got a new name and is more costly, but it has good service and drinks. Most people there are nice. They are either college students or have lower incomes since the apartments are not costly. There are many children around because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I think is funny and almost rude. The buildings near me look old but might have new interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I do not like them. The construction was not good. They are built cheaply, but rent is high because they are near the campus. I think that is unfair. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which I hear is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, and grass on the sides, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut some trees down, leaving stumps. But there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my place are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is behind and not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment there, but I cannot blame just them. There are problems across from me too. Despite this, I like where I live. I can afford it, and useful places are nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex houses on a cul-de-sac. They are spread out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. We often stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk while children play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern, busy world. It is like going back in time. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nBut this season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado sirens, so we went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog did not like the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail on the ground. After the storm, the road steamed because the temperature changed. It went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sky cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera. I took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They loved them, and so did I. The streets were quiet for another hour until people came home after the storm. Then life went back to normal with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly neighborhood for me, who just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the way people speak here with a southern accent. \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments inside are different. Some are small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog sing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm you can hear in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was very sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. So, we moved to a better place with good housing and a nice high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They live next to us. They are nice people, and I see them as family in some ways. I appreciate them a lot. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I enjoyed it. I look forward to having a good life in the future. At the wedding, I caught the strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers. We danced all night, and I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I explore it more with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I bring sticks from home depot to practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. There is a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. These are the ones that stand out to me. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not different from other towns in South Carolina, but it helps agriculture a lot. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on its welcome sign. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are usually set back from the road, with fields in front for animals or crops. In the main town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores are. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town. Many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A friendly woman runs it. The store has been in Johnston for many years. They have two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are away from the main town. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but the town is making a 2.5-acre recreation area for families and visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town and very small. You could pass it quickly without noticing.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. We have more cars on the street than I like. But it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs at home. In winter, we sled down a hill. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people come and go all day. We know the cars people drive. When we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We stay at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us, my wife and I, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People here know us well too. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The barbecue smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees because the area was once a forest. There is a lot of shade but also many leaves in the Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows that Fall is here. Winter has been mild lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only when someone knocks, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other things. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors from other places. We see many cars parked then. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt here. People who have not lived here might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a lawn, that person is spending much money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Many places are changing like this. Most of the time, people are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I live near kind old people. Stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you have to travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. The main jobs here are in construction. This city is still not very developed. There are many open spaces to build. That scares me because I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The high desert climate and land create ecosystems that need protection. These are home to many types of wildlife. People here should learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains. You can also take winter sports lessons there. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These show the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Many people have their own homes, but my place is not the same. I call the college campus where I live my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around us is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.  \n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Usually, there are 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms and often house alumni. There are only a few of these houses. The dorm rooms are the most common. They house many students, with two people sharing a room.  \n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments.  \n\nNext, we have stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores include dining places and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores. You can find everything you need here! The park is a clean and safe place for everyone. People in my neighborhood keep it that way.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downward, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be a bit unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines, and repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high up on the hill, with big glass windows on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines, and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you see sunlight through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. You often see them in lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have hunted most of them away. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores here, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will find it easy to get there. Public transportation is simple to use in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy place, so you will feel like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on almost every street. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like to shop at these places because the food is very good, prices are lower, and it is easy to shop there. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets close to each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is a mix of many people, with immigrants and their children. Many big stores here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park with many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in the summer. Parks in New York City have many different people. You will see many kids playing together. There are no big corporate buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses or apartments. The people are nice, but it is noisy. You hear loud music from cars and engines in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here years ago, and packages sometimes get stolen. Also, people do not pick up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that calls itself \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this sign on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. The slogan asks people to remember the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when the city was less known and cheaper. It was a time of creative and unique groups. For others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but they mean it as a good thing.\n\nMany people from California have moved to Portland. New buildings are being built for them. Still, Portland is weird. Weird means accepting things not usually accepted. It does not mean Portland lacks modern comforts or struggles. Like the rest of the country, most of our things come from China. There are many ways of being weird, but Portland has normal things too. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking life too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many in Portland, houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In summer, you can find free boxes on the streets. These are boxes where people put things they no longer need. Often, these boxes hold clothes and books, but they can have anything. You might find a perfect treasure in one of these boxes. This is the magic of a walk through Southeast Portland. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many.\n\nSome people here would not pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They might go to goat yoga or to a Timbers soccer game. Portland is full of people who love many things. We chase our dreams or think about our dreams while at the bar. Portland has a drug problem. This is often a mental health issue. The rain and clouds might make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one knows how to solve it. Many homeless people come here because Portland offers good services. But these services are not enough. People here feel both care and anger about the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they see the sun rise and set. I may forget them when busy with work and life, but they stay strong and calm. When I feel most stressed, they ask to be seen. I look at them and feel peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I first came here for college. The mountains north of campus caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold my heart. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied with lots of coffee. You can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, old brick buildings line the streets. It feels like a busy city. But just past the library, it becomes a quiet small town again. This mix makes the city feel special, like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. Like walking in the park after a night of study or going to a movie downtown. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are good for thinking or crying when life feels hard. I have done this a lot. I watch the turtles, ducks, and bugs and think about my purpose in life. I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses until I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and sky, and I realize I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They seem to speak and give me hope.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a place behind a shopping area. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go past the old Whole Foods and walk behind the hotels, you will find a community. These hotels are mostly empty except in the summer when families visit. \n\nIn this community, there are several apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like pieces of a puzzle. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about those. But the other apartments are different, and most people around here do not know about them. \n\nAcross the street is a small college campus. It is quiet. Students come with coffee in their hands, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers get upset when the traffic is slow on busy days. \n\nThe road meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones. The center has nice chairs on the porch and a fan moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and spin on the grass. Bees move around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. Teenage girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube. \n\nThere is a sushi place in the shopping strip by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store for swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken, all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt store. Teens like to go there. They eat yogurt with toppings, do tricks on skateboards, and vape because they think it is cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a small piece of America. It is a place in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some houses are split into two but still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for many in America. This dream once made people happy, but now it seems to be fading. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we try to hold onto it. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not as well-kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways, and children play as if their world is complete. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It offers hope to young people today and brings back memories for older folks. There are few churches, mostly empty, but basketball courts are still busy. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A.\" It is owned by a Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only when cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations and tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when movies about karate stopped being popular, kids lost interest. Now, it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at low prices. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it. It is a cheap night out without kids. There is one expressway near my town. The exit is in the next town. People wanted an exit for our town. Young people liked this idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would change our town, so they stopped it. A new high school is being built, and we need to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best for my town.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people and places. Homes are spread around the area. Shops and restaurants are nearby. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and popular. They are in malls and on the streets. These streets are close to homes that are usually quiet. There are parks near my home. Many people go there with their children. \n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There are LGBTQ+ groups, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. In other parts of the city, there are more people from different places. There are areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are not far, but traffic makes driving slow. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Most people drive because the city is big. Walking is not common. Parking is hard to find. \n\nThere has been much building in the city. Many new apartment buildings are going up. This city is a popular place to live. But, more people means more traffic. Some people are not happy about this. There are many types of homes. Some are big, others small. There are houses and small apartment buildings. My neighborhood has many kinds of homes. \n\nPeople of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But, I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open space before. She was surprised by all the corn fields. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she knew more about me and where I came from. \n\nWe drove on a small road. We passed a quarry full of water. Just past it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a large yard. Everyone takes care of their yard. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars that shine in the sun. \n\nAs we continued, we saw my grey stucco home. My Korean neighbor was outside with a smile. He spent the day mowing his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a good person with a special past. He used to be a doctor. \n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese ran from our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream. It feeds into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes, you hear a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge is an untouched area. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. \n\nThe winters in my town are very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. In our wonderland, we pretended and played. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You move from farmland to small cities for visitors. There are no big city stores like malls, Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive everywhere you need to go. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you look, there is a beach to enjoy. \n\nMy neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old and some are being fixed up. Most homes have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Many houses have older metal siding. Houses are many different colors. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. People work hard for a living and raise families. Kids play in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and skate. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. People wave to each other and smile. \n\nLawns are kept nice. No one has leaves from fall. Grass is green and cut. If there are plants and bushes, they are trimmed. The neighborhood may not look special, but it feels like a good place for families. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It shows what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. \n\nNearby is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields close by. You can hear the announcers call the game. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. \n\nYou can walk to buy ice cream from a local shop. You can also go downtown from the neighborhood. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association in my neighborhood. Because of this, the homes are well-kept. Front yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some yards have small trees. All houses have two-car garages. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one-story, but some are two-story. Mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to open our mailboxes. There are also two lockers for packages. This is due to the homeowner's association. My house is on the edge of the city. So, the area is part rural, part suburb. We have a lot of land. There are pools for people who live here. They are clean and gated. There are trails for walking dogs or walking alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place, and people care for each other. There are some middle-aged and young workers too. The city is large by population but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is fine. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to important places. There, I find many stores. We have high-end groceries with organic food. We also have bargain stores with a few items and low costs. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you want.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a show about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over the years. You start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. You notice smells less when you are older. You might start to smoke, or maybe you just get used to how things are. The flea market smell is strong. The smell of being an adult is dusty papers on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you wash it. Here, there are 3 thrift stores you can walk to. If you start at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. Even with many cars and people, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a large online trade and delivery company. It is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone follows their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and free, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we are less strangers and more like a group of friends. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave them food; they do the same for me. I bring them mail, and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy seeing me too. I live in a big, modern area, but people like my neighbors make me feel like my life is good.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My part of town is on the east side. It is not a rich area. Many people here have low income. Most houses are rented or owned by people with little money. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are nice. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit more common than in other parts of town, but not too much. There have been some violent crimes nearby in the last ten years, like shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. Our family has been lucky, with only small things taken from our porch. The town has been hit hard by the \"opioid epidemic,\" like many places in the United States. Many have died from drug overdoses. But there are resources here to help, like rehab centers and training for families of drug users. Despite these problems, my town has good points. My son’s school is great. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is welcoming. He loves it there. The PTO plans many events to get families involved. Over 20% of people in town are poor, so the school gives free meals to all students. No child goes hungry, and fees are kept low. The City Council has improved the town’s look by fixing roads, adding plants, and fixing parks. Sadly, these changes are mostly in the center and west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often ignored, which bothers us. Still, I like living here. People are friendly, schools are good, and there are enough stores for us. Our home may not be worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot think of living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from an old theater. A block down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. During weekends in June and July, there is often a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete, with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near a family center where they can wash. \n\nI love my city not for the old buildings or their beauty. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. Even now, people tell stories about those days. They remember when the government tried to clean the streets. People work hard to keep it clean. They still care about their city and block. People say that if you are white, you should not walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is from the old days. Maybe I am dark enough to not look all white, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city meant to be a cultural mix. But I know Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are kind and help each other. Laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone. People tell me I am beautiful and valuable, even on the greyest nights.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have good memories. Most people who lived here when I came are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but the good memories are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are young and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park now makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food is popular, and there are many pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian-owned store for Indian food. \n\nI like my neighborhood. I feel grateful when I hear stories about bad neighbors on social media or the news.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar got a new name and is more costly, but it has good service and drinks. Most people there are nice. They are either college students or have lower incomes since the apartments are not costly. There are many children around because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I think is funny and almost rude. The buildings near me look old but might have new interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I do not like them. The construction was not good. They are built cheaply, but rent is high because they are near the campus. I think that is unfair. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which I hear is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, and grass on the sides, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut some trees down, leaving stumps. But there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my place are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is behind and not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment there, but I cannot blame just them. There are problems across from me too. Despite this, I like where I live. I can afford it, and useful places are nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex houses on a cul-de-sac. They are spread out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. We often stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk while children play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern, busy world. It is like going back in time. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nBut this season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado sirens, so we went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog did not like the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail on the ground. After the storm, the road steamed because the temperature changed. It went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sky cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera. I took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They loved them, and so did I. The streets were quiet for another hour until people came home after the storm. Then life went back to normal with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly neighborhood for me, who just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the way people speak here with a southern accent. \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments inside are different. Some are small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog sing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm you can hear in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was very sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. So, we moved to a better place with good housing and a nice high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They live next to us. They are nice people, and I see them as family in some ways. I appreciate them a lot. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I enjoyed it. I look forward to having a good life in the future. At the wedding, I caught the strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers. We danced all night, and I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I explore it more with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I bring sticks from home depot to practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. There is a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. These are the ones that stand out to me. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not different from other towns in South Carolina, but it helps agriculture a lot. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on its welcome sign. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are usually set back from the road, with fields in front for animals or crops. In the main town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores are. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town. Many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A friendly woman runs it. The store has been in Johnston for many years. They have two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are away from the main town. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but the town is making a 2.5-acre recreation area for families and visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town and very small. You could pass it quickly without noticing.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. We have more cars on the street than I like. But it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs at home. In winter, we sled down a hill. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people come and go all day. We know the cars people drive. When we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We stay at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us, my wife and I, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People here know us well too. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The barbecue smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees because the area was once a forest. There is a lot of shade but also many leaves in the Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows that Fall is here. Winter has been mild lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only when someone knocks, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other things. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors from other places. We see many cars parked then. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt here. People who have not lived here might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a lawn, that person is spending much money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Many places are changing like this. Most of the time, people are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I live near kind old people. Stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you have to travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. The main jobs here are in construction. This city is still not very developed. There are many open spaces to build. That scares me because I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The high desert climate and land create ecosystems that need protection. These are home to many types of wildlife. People here should learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains. You can also take winter sports lessons there. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These show the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Many people have their own homes, but my place is not the same. I call the college campus where I live my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around us is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.  \n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Usually, there are 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms and often house alumni. There are only a few of these houses. The dorm rooms are the most common. They house many students, with two people sharing a room.  \n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments.  \n\nNext, we have stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores include dining places and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores. You can find everything you need here! The park is a clean and safe place for everyone. People in my neighborhood keep it that way.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downward, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be a bit unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines, and repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high up on the hill, with big glass windows on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines, and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you see sunlight through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. You often see them in lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have hunted most of them away. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores here, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will find it easy to get there. Public transportation is simple to use in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy place, so you will feel like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on almost every street. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like to shop at these places because the food is very good, prices are lower, and it is easy to shop there. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets close to each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is a mix of many people, with immigrants and their children. Many big stores here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park with many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in the summer. Parks in New York City have many different people. You will see many kids playing together. There are no big corporate buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses or apartments. The people are nice, but it is noisy. You hear loud music from cars and engines in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here years ago, and packages sometimes get stolen. Also, people do not pick up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that calls itself \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this sign on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. The slogan asks people to remember the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when the city was less known and cheaper. It was a time of creative and unique groups. For others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but they mean it as a good thing.\n\nMany people from California have moved to Portland. New buildings are being built for them. Still, Portland is weird. Weird means accepting things not usually accepted. It does not mean Portland lacks modern comforts or struggles. Like the rest of the country, most of our things come from China. There are many ways of being weird, but Portland has normal things too. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking life too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many in Portland, houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In summer, you can find free boxes on the streets. These are boxes where people put things they no longer need. Often, these boxes hold clothes and books, but they can have anything. You might find a perfect treasure in one of these boxes. This is the magic of a walk through Southeast Portland. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many.\n\nSome people here would not pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They might go to goat yoga or to a Timbers soccer game. Portland is full of people who love many things. We chase our dreams or think about our dreams while at the bar. Portland has a drug problem. This is often a mental health issue. The rain and clouds might make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one knows how to solve it. Many homeless people come here because Portland offers good services. But these services are not enough. People here feel both care and anger about the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they see the sun rise and set. I may forget them when busy with work and life, but they stay strong and calm. When I feel most stressed, they ask to be seen. I look at them and feel peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I first came here for college. The mountains north of campus caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold my heart. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied with lots of coffee. You can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, old brick buildings line the streets. It feels like a busy city. But just past the library, it becomes a quiet small town again. This mix makes the city feel special, like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. Like walking in the park after a night of study or going to a movie downtown. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are good for thinking or crying when life feels hard. I have done this a lot. I watch the turtles, ducks, and bugs and think about my purpose in life. I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses until I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and sky, and I realize I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They seem to speak and give me hope.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a place behind a shopping area. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go past the old Whole Foods and walk behind the hotels, you will find a community. These hotels are mostly empty except in the summer when families visit. \n\nIn this community, there are several apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like pieces of a puzzle. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about those. But the other apartments are different, and most people around here do not know about them. \n\nAcross the street is a small college campus. It is quiet. Students come with coffee in their hands, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers get upset when the traffic is slow on busy days. \n\nThe road meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones. The center has nice chairs on the porch and a fan moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and spin on the grass. Bees move around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. Teenage girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube. \n\nThere is a sushi place in the shopping strip by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store for swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken, all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt store. Teens like to go there. They eat yogurt with toppings, do tricks on skateboards, and vape because they think it is cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a small piece of America. It is a place in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some houses are split into two but still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for many in America. This dream once made people happy, but now it seems to be fading. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we try to hold onto it. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not as well-kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways, and children play as if their world is complete. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It offers hope to young people today and brings back memories for older folks. There are few churches, mostly empty, but basketball courts are still busy. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A.\" It is owned by a Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only when cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations and tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when movies about karate stopped being popular, kids lost interest. Now, it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at low prices. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it. It is a cheap night out without kids. There is one expressway near my town. The exit is in the next town. People wanted an exit for our town. Young people liked this idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would change our town, so they stopped it. A new high school is being built, and we need to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best for my town.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people and places. Homes are spread around the area. Shops and restaurants are nearby. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and popular. They are in malls and on the streets. These streets are close to homes that are usually quiet. There are parks near my home. Many people go there with their children. \n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There are LGBTQ+ groups, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. In other parts of the city, there are more people from different places. There are areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are not far, but traffic makes driving slow. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Most people drive because the city is big. Walking is not common. Parking is hard to find. \n\nThere has been much building in the city. Many new apartment buildings are going up. This city is a popular place to live. But, more people means more traffic. Some people are not happy about this. There are many types of homes. Some are big, others small. There are houses and small apartment buildings. My neighborhood has many kinds of homes. \n\nPeople of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But, I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open space before. She was surprised by all the corn fields. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she knew more about me and where I came from. \n\nWe drove on a small road. We passed a quarry full of water. Just past it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a large yard. Everyone takes care of their yard. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars that shine in the sun. \n\nAs we continued, we saw my grey stucco home. My Korean neighbor was outside with a smile. He spent the day mowing his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a good person with a special past. He used to be a doctor. \n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese ran from our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream. It feeds into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes, you hear a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge is an untouched area. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. \n\nThe winters in my town are very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. In our wonderland, we pretended and played. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You move from farmland to small cities for visitors. There are no big city stores like malls, Wal-mart, Target, or Applebee’s. You have to drive everywhere you need to go. But, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town is surrounded by water. There is Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you look, there is a beach to enjoy. \n\nMy neighborhood shows the idea of a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some houses are old and some are being fixed up. Most homes have basements. You can see the basements from the road. Many houses have older metal siding. Houses are many different colors. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show Middle America. People work hard for a living and raise families. Kids play in the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and skate. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who belongs and who does not. People wave to each other and smile. \n\nLawns are kept nice. No one has leaves from fall. Grass is green and cut. If there are plants and bushes, they are trimmed. The neighborhood may not look special, but it feels like a good place for families. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It shows what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. \n\nNearby is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. There are baseball and softball fields close by. You can hear the announcers call the game. The small town airport is next to the fields. You hear small planes take off and land. \n\nYou can walk to buy ice cream from a local shop. You can also go downtown from the neighborhood. My kids can ride bikes to the park, which is only a few blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "The area where I live is a typical suburb. There is a homeowner's association in my neighborhood. Because of this, the homes are well-kept. Front yards have grass, pebbles, and short driveways. Some yards have small trees. All houses have two-car garages. The roads are new and smooth. There are no potholes. Most houses are one-story, but some are two-story. Mailboxes are not in front of each house. Instead, there is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to open our mailboxes. There are also two lockers for packages. This is due to the homeowner's association. My house is on the edge of the city. So, the area is part rural, part suburb. We have a lot of land. There are pools for people who live here. They are clean and gated. There are trails for walking dogs or walking alone. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. The neighborhood is big enough to run around. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place, and people care for each other. There are some middle-aged and young workers too. The city is large by population but feels like a small town. We have most things you need. We have one mall. It is not big, but it is fine. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to important places. There, I find many stores. We have high-end groceries with organic food. We also have bargain stores with a few items and low costs. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and typical. We have nice things like pools and trails. We are not close to shopping, but you can drive to any big store you want.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a show about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we learned to save money over the years. You start to like the smell of old toys and clothes. You notice smells less when you are older. You might start to smoke, or maybe you just get used to how things are. The flea market smell is strong. The smell of being an adult is dusty papers on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you wash it. Here, there are 3 thrift stores you can walk to. If you start at one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you do not hear it in the thrift stores. Even with many cars and people, the store is quiet. It is a nice place to spend an afternoon. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a large online trade and delivery company. It is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone follows their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and free, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where caring means being concerned. You do not ask about anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself, and the city will move like waves on the beach. It is a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two singers upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we are less strangers and more like a group of friends. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave them food; they do the same for me. I bring them mail, and they bring mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy seeing me too. I live in a big, modern area, but people like my neighbors make me feel like my life is good.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, near a big city. My part of town is on the east side. It is not a rich area. Many people here have low income. Most houses are rented or owned by people with little money. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are nice. They smile and say hello when I walk by. Crime is a bit more common than in other parts of town, but not too much. There have been some violent crimes nearby in the last ten years, like shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. Our family has been lucky, with only small things taken from our porch. The town has been hit hard by the \"opioid epidemic,\" like many places in the United States. Many have died from drug overdoses. But there are resources here to help, like rehab centers and training for families of drug users. Despite these problems, my town has good points. My son’s school is great. The staff is excellent. He has special needs but has not been bullied because the school is welcoming. He loves it there. The PTO plans many events to get families involved. Over 20% of people in town are poor, so the school gives free meals to all students. No child goes hungry, and fees are kept low. The City Council has improved the town’s look by fixing roads, adding plants, and fixing parks. Sadly, these changes are mostly in the center and west side, where shops are. The east side, where I live, is often ignored, which bothers us. Still, I like living here. People are friendly, schools are good, and there are enough stores for us. Our home may not be worth much, but it is nice. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot think of living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill, with buildings that have history around it. I live in a 7-story apartment building. It is across from an old theater. A block down the hill, there is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. During weekends in June and July, there is often a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete, with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people set up tents along the sidewalk and steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. Keeping their tents close helps them stay warm. They are also near a family center where they can wash. \n\nI love my city not for the old buildings or their beauty. I love it for the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. Even now, people tell stories about those days. They remember when the government tried to clean the streets. People work hard to keep it clean. They still care about their city and block. People say that if you are white, you should not walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is from the old days. Maybe I am dark enough to not look all white, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist, even in a city meant to be a cultural mix. But I know Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night. People are kind and help each other. Laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone. People tell me I am beautiful and valuable, even on the greyest nights.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I have good memories. Most people who lived here when I came are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online, and none have been taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park a short walk from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but the good memories are more. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They are young and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes them happy. The park now makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food is popular, and there are many pizza places too. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian-owned store for Indian food. \n\nI like my neighborhood. I feel grateful when I hear stories about bad neighbors on social media or the news.",
            "My neighborhood is near the college I go to, and I like living there. There are mostly apartment buildings. There are a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not too expensive. One bar got a new name and is more costly, but it has good service and drinks. Most people there are nice. They are either college students or have lower incomes since the apartments are not costly. There are many children around because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I think is funny and almost rude. The buildings near me look old but might have new interiors. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I do not like them. The construction was not good. They are built cheaply, but rent is high because they are near the campus. I think that is unfair. There is a cheap restaurant five minutes away. They use paper plates and microwave most food. Across from it is a gas station, which I hear is not a good place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk, and grass on the sides, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut some trees down, leaving stumps. But there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my place are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street is behind and not as nice. The sidewalks there are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment there, but I cannot blame just them. There are problems across from me too. Despite this, I like where I live. I can afford it, and useful places are nearby. I like that the university is close, and there are two bus stops to get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex houses on a cul-de-sac. They are spread out to look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends here. We often stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk while children play with toys, chalk, or fly kites. It feels nice in our modern, busy world. It is like going back in time. We have fields and trees around us with blue skies and white clouds. \n\nBut this season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard tornado sirens, so we went to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog did not like the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail on the ground. After the storm, the road steamed because the temperature changed. It went from 92 to 75 in minutes. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sky cleared, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran inside to get my camera. I took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They loved them, and so did I. The streets were quiet for another hour until people came home after the storm. Then life went back to normal with moms and children outside while dinner cooked. It is a friendly neighborhood for me, who just moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the way people speak here with a southern accent. \n\nI have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The houses look the same outside, but the apartments inside are different. Some are small, which I do not understand. I like to walk in the big field behind my place and go to the pond, which is not for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog sing. It is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm you can hear in the evening. I was lucky to find this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I have lived here for about 10 years, so I can share what I know. At first, I was very sad when I moved to my new neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister. So, we moved to a better place with good housing and a nice high school. Our new neighborhood was not considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They live next to us. They are nice people, and I see them as family in some ways. I appreciate them a lot. I remember when my family and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding. It was fun, and I enjoyed it. I look forward to having a good life in the future. At the wedding, I caught the strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers. We danced all night, and I had a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since then. I hope she is doing well. The neighborhood is like a maze, but now I have a GPS. I explore it more with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I bring sticks from home depot to practice my balance. I also bring my wooden sword if I can. There is a basketball and tennis court. I have not played in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I have many good memories in this neighborhood. These are the ones that stand out to me. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is not different from other towns in South Carolina, but it helps agriculture a lot. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town shows this on its welcome sign. The area has many farms with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most have two stories and metal roofs or gray shingles. These houses are usually set back from the road, with fields in front for animals or crops. In the main town, there is one stoplight at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores are. There are three places for fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but costly grocery store called IGA. It is the only grocery store in town. Many people go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A friendly woman runs it. The store has been in Johnston for many years. They have two movers to deliver furniture. Next to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are away from the main town. They are small but help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to middle and high school in the next town. There are no parks, but the town is making a 2.5-acre recreation area for families and visitors. There is not much to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or many restaurants. Still, it is a nice town and very small. You could pass it quickly without noticing.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It is a suburb area. Our street connects two highways. We have more cars on the street than I like. But it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs at home. In winter, we sled down a hill. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people come and go all day. We know the cars people drive. When we see a new car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes. We stay at home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us, my wife and I, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. People here know us well too. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill on our back deck. The barbecue smell is nice. Someone is always cutting grass. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees because the area was once a forest. There is a lot of shade but also many leaves in the Fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows that Fall is here. Winter has been mild lately, so it feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We use the front door only when someone knocks, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other things. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have visitors from other places. We see many cars parked then. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt here. People who have not lived here might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a lawn, that person is spending much money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were far apart. Now, it is still like that, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Many places are changing like this. Most of the time, people are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I live near kind old people. Stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale stores, you have to travel. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. The main jobs here are in construction. This city is still not very developed. There are many open spaces to build. That scares me because I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like the different animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The high desert climate and land create ecosystems that need protection. These are home to many types of wildlife. People here should learn about the animals to live safely and peacefully with them. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children. They love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains. You can also take winter sports lessons there. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects. These show the story of Victorville's development.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is different. Many people have their own homes, but my place is not the same. I call the college campus where I live my neighborhood. The people in my dormitory are my community. The campus around us is also part of my neighborhood, but less so. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.  \n\nLet's talk about the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, real houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Usually, there are 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. The real houses can be rented by people connected to the school. They have 2-4 bedrooms and often house alumni. There are only a few of these houses. The dorm rooms are the most common. They house many students, with two people sharing a room.  \n\nNow, let's talk about the people. My school values diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses, new students in dorms, and older students in apartments.  \n\nNext, we have stores and parks. My school is like its own neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores include dining places and the school's own brand of clothing and grocery stores. You can find everything you need here! The park is a clean and safe place for everyone. People in my neighborhood keep it that way.",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes downward, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers run up it during their daily exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has some holes and can be a bit unsafe to drive on. Some telephone and electric wires look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines, and repairs make them look patchy. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are high up on the hill, with big glass windows on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water shines, and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you see sunlight through a haze. Most days are gray and wet. Moss grows on roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children here, though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. You often see them in lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants. My cats love them and have hunted most of them away. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by until the crows chase it off. There are no stores here, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will find it easy to get there. Public transportation is simple to use in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy place, so you will feel like you are still in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on almost every street. Supermarkets and laundromats are very common. People like to shop at these places because the food is very good, prices are lower, and it is easy to shop there. Near my place, there are four Asian supermarkets close to each other. This makes it easy to get groceries. Bensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is a mix of many people, with immigrants and their children. Many big stores here are Asian-owned. There is also a new park with many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in the summer. Parks in New York City have many different people. You will see many kids playing together. There are no big corporate buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses or apartments. The people are nice, but it is noisy. You hear loud music from cars and engines in the morning. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but some people may cause trouble. I was bullied here years ago, and packages sometimes get stolen. Also, people do not pick up after their dogs, even though there is a fine. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that calls itself \"weird.\" The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" You can see this sign on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music spot, and strip club. The slogan asks people to remember the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when the city was less known and cheaper. It was a time of creative and unique groups. For others, the slogan invites people to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but they mean it as a good thing.\n\nMany people from California have moved to Portland. New buildings are being built for them. Still, Portland is weird. Weird means accepting things not usually accepted. It does not mean Portland lacks modern comforts or struggles. Like the rest of the country, most of our things come from China. There are many ways of being weird, but Portland has normal things too. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking life too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many in Portland, houses are colorful. There are gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In summer, you can find free boxes on the streets. These are boxes where people put things they no longer need. Often, these boxes hold clothes and books, but they can have anything. You might find a perfect treasure in one of these boxes. This is the magic of a walk through Southeast Portland. That is what Portland means to me, but I am just one kind of weird among many.\n\nSome people here would not pick clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They might go to goat yoga or to a Timbers soccer game. Portland is full of people who love many things. We chase our dreams or think about our dreams while at the bar. Portland has a drug problem. This is often a mental health issue. The rain and clouds might make it worse. Portland also has a homelessness problem. No one knows how to solve it. Many homeless people come here because Portland offers good services. But these services are not enough. People here feel both care and anger about the homeless. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they see the sun rise and set. I may forget them when busy with work and life, but they stay strong and calm. When I feel most stressed, they ask to be seen. I look at them and feel peace. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I first came here for college. The mountains north of campus caught my eye. The university has pretty buildings, ponds, and trees, but the mountains hold my heart. The town is also nice. Many cafés were places where I studied with lots of coffee. You can walk or take a bus to downtown. There, old brick buildings line the streets. It feels like a busy city. But just past the library, it becomes a quiet small town again. This mix makes the city feel special, like it wants you to explore. You can make many good memories here. Like walking in the park after a night of study or going to a movie downtown. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are good for thinking or crying when life feels hard. I have done this a lot. I watch the turtles, ducks, and bugs and think about my purpose in life. I walk past the pond, the park, and the houses until I reach a main street. The sun shines on the palm trees and sky, and I realize I am walking north. The mountains are there, as always. They touch the sky more than any building. They seem to speak and give me hope.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a place behind a shopping area. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go past the old Whole Foods and walk behind the hotels, you will find a community. These hotels are mostly empty except in the summer when families visit. \n\nIn this community, there are several apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like pieces of a puzzle. The first apartments have been on the news for bad things, so we will not talk about those. But the other apartments are different, and most people around here do not know about them. \n\nAcross the street is a small college campus. It is quiet. Students come with coffee in their hands, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers get upset when the traffic is slow on busy days. \n\nThe road meets another road. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones. The center has nice chairs on the porch and a fan moves the warm air. Children play in the park. They run and spin on the grass. Bees move around the flowers. Old people walk their dogs and look at the teenagers on skateboards. Teenage girls stand by the playground and talk about boys and YouTube. \n\nThere is a sushi place in the shopping strip by the park. It has cheap food but is not busy. Next to it, there is a store for swimming supplies and a nail salon. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and eat chicken, all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt store. Teens like to go there. They eat yogurt with toppings, do tricks on skateboards, and vape because they think it is cool. \n\nThis neighborhood is a small piece of America. It is a place in the south where things do not change much, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some houses are split into two but still attached. My home has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. It reminds you of a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for many in America. This dream once made people happy, but now it seems to be fading. Still, my neighborhood and others like it remain. They show that the dream is still alive, and we try to hold onto it. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The yards are not as well-kept as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways, and children play as if their world is complete. The public school has been here for almost 90 years. It offers hope to young people today and brings back memories for older folks. There are few churches, mostly empty, but basketball courts are still busy. All homes look different but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A.\" It is owned by a Yemeni family. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide, and kids play football, stopping only when cars pass. Many people have lived here for generations and tell stories of when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school. But when movies about karate stopped being popular, kids lost interest. Now, it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It shows old movies at low prices. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it. It is a cheap night out without kids. There is one expressway near my town. The exit is in the next town. People wanted an exit for our town. Young people liked this idea, but older people did not. They thought the expressway would change our town, so they stopped it. A new high school is being built, and we need to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best for my town.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people and places. Homes are spread around the area. Shops and restaurants are nearby. There are many places to eat and shop. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and popular. They are in malls and on the streets. These streets are close to homes that are usually quiet. There are parks near my home. Many people go there with their children. \n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of people. There are LGBTQ+ groups, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. In other parts of the city, there are more people from different places. There are areas called Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These places are not far, but traffic makes driving slow. It can take a long time to go a short distance. Most people drive because the city is big. Walking is not common. Parking is hard to find. \n\nThere has been much building in the city. Many new apartment buildings are going up. This city is a popular place to live. But, more people means more traffic. Some people are not happy about this. There are many types of homes. Some are big, others small. There are houses and small apartment buildings. My neighborhood has many kinds of homes. \n\nPeople of all ages live here. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now. But, I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open space before. She was surprised by all the corn fields. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she knew more about me and where I came from. \n\nWe drove on a small road. We passed a quarry full of water. Just past it is the small place where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a large yard. Everyone takes care of their yard. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars that shine in the sun. \n\nAs we continued, we saw my grey stucco home. My Korean neighbor was outside with a smile. He spent the day mowing his lawn. He sang while he worked. Everyone liked him. He was a good person with a special past. He used to be a doctor. \n\nFinally, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese ran from our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream. It feeds into the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs and the stream. Sometimes, you hear a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge is an untouched area. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. \n\nThe winters in my town are very cold, but they are also beautiful. The yard changes from green to white. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a wonderland. My sister makes snow angels and snowmen. We fought often as kids. In winter, we threw snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. In our wonderland, we pretended and played. We were just kids without a care in the world."
