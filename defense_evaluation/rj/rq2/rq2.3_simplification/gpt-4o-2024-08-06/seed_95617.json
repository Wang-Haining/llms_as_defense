            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You go from farms to small tourist towns here. There are no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is surrounded by water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to visit almost anywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some homes are old, some have been updated, and some are remodeled. Most homes have basements. You can see full basements from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. We have houses of every color. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show what Middle America is like. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have already raised them. \n\nYou will see kids running up and down the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who fits in and who doesn’t. You see someone grilling outside and wave. You see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns are kept in good shape. No leaves are piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood. But it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. \n\nOur town has a county sheriff’s department and jail nearby. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers call the names of players. Our small airport is next to that. You can hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. You can go downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group makes sure all houses look good. The front yards have grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big boxes for packages. My house is on the edge of the city, so it is a mix of rural and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools that people can use. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking trails for walking or running. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People help each other. We also have some middle-aged and young workers. The city is big in population but feels like a small town. We have many things we need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to places, but there are many shops there. We have expensive grocery stores and discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and trails. If you want to shop, you can drive to many big stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It talked about people who were missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we have learned to save money. We like the smell of old toys and clothes from the market. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to things. The market always has a smell. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you clean it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it is quiet. It is nice to spend an afternoon there. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city. It is home to a big online company for selling and delivery. It still grows. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people ask questions because they care. Here, you do not get into other people's lives. You can keep to yourself, and the city moves like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs always do something. We are more like friends than strangers. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring them their mail and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not a rich area. Most houses are owned or rented by people with low incomes. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello on the street. Crime is higher here than in other parts of town, but still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. This includes shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been affected by crime, except for some things taken from our porch now and then. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the U.S. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But my town has resources to help fight this problem. There are centers for addiction help and training for using Narcan, a drug that can save lives. \n\nThis town has good things too. My son's elementary school is great. The staff, teachers, and support people are excellent. My son has special needs but has not faced bullying. The school has a positive atmosphere, and he loves it. We have an active PTO that plans events for families. Over 20% of the people here are poor. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is left hungry. School fees, supplies, and trips are affordable. \n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They repaved roads and fixed parks. But most changes are in the center and west side of town. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This bothers people in my area. \n\nOverall, I like living here. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are enough stores for my family's needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We cannot imagine living somewhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill with buildings that have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. A block down from here is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see people waiting to get in. There is a big city park a few blocks away. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people put tents on the sidewalk and steps. It rains a lot, making it hard to stay warm. They put tents together in the center of town to stay warm. They are close to a family center where they can wash. What I love about my city is not the old buildings or the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. People still tell stories about that time. People work hard to keep it clean now. They care about their city and block. Some say if you're white, don't walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is an old belief. Maybe I look different enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist in our nation. Hilltop is home to me. I feel alive walking there at night. People are kind and offer help. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when it rains. It is a place where someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is one or two minutes from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other guys from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like swings and slides. They get excited about the park. The park makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are popular as in any suburb. There are many pizza places too. Stores here have what you need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse, like an Indian-owned store if you want Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read on social media or see on the news about others' bad experiences with neighbors, it makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not very expensive. One bar just got a new name. It costs more to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have lower income because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children because an elementary school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener by their door. My boyfriend and I find that funny. It is almost insulting. The buildings near me look old, but they might be nice inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them. I know they are not built well. They are cheap to build but cost a lot to rent. I think this is not fair. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a very cheap restaurant five minutes from my home. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city fixed the road. Now, there is a big sidewalk, and grass on the sides. The area looks nicer now. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut, so there are stumps. There are more trees here than down the road. Behind my apartment is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees on this street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But I cannot blame only them. There are also apartments across the street from me with crime and many people moving in and out. I think I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close. There are two bus stops, so I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are placed apart so they look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. Some evenings, we stand outside and talk while the children play. It feels nice in this modern world full of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. There are fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds around us. \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens and had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog with my purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the change in temperature. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. I looked up at the sky, and the sun came out. It started to rain and a double rainbow appeared. I ran inside, got my camera, and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. \n\nI recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The outside of the houses looks the same, but the inside does not. Some apartments are quite small, which I find odd. I like to walk by the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey at a farm nearby that brays at night. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have been here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a better place with good homes and schools. At first, everything was new and strange, but I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school.\n\nI did not know many of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who live next door. They are nice people and feel like family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun. They got re-married. I caught the white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers! We all danced and had a good time. I also danced with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since, but I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. Now, I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I used to hang out with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and enjoyed life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It calms me and gives me peace. I bring sticks from the store to practice my balance, and sometimes I bring my wooden sword. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played them in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me how to play tennis. We worked hard but had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. The town is called Johnston. It is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the town entrance says this. Most of the land is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. These roofs help keep houses cool in summer. Houses are often not near the road. They are set back with fields in front for animals or crops. \n\nIn the main town, there is one stop light at a crossing. The only stores are here. There are three places for quick food. Hong Kong is a small Chinese restaurant. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant is another. Gary's is a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small family-owned drug store called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only one in town. People often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. The store has been here for many years. It has two movers who deliver furniture. Next to it is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer many services for pets like grooming and bathing. \n\nThere is a small doctor’s office and a vet. They are not in the main town but are well-equipped. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but they are making a 2.5-acre recreation area. This will give families more to do and bring visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. There are not many restaurants. But it is a nice town. It is so small you can pass it quickly without knowing.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is a street that connects two highways. There is more traffic than I like, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs each day. In winter, we sled down a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people and cars coming and going all day. We know the cars people drive here. We notice when we see a new car. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids play on bikes and do other things you might expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters, and me. The girls are eleven and fourteen years old. I think people here are used to us too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill food on our back deck. It smells good. Many people cut grass here. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. There are many trees, so there is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. We do not have much Winter now, so Fall feels longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I work on my truck or other jobs in the garage sometimes. When the garage doors are open, I feel more part of the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have guests from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now it is the same, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has friendly old people. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For nicer stores, you have to travel far. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. Many people work in construction here. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live together safely. My family and I have adapted well. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things about the history and culture of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is a bit different. Most people think of houses and families. But my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like others in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. \n\nLet me tell you about the \"houses\" here. There are three kinds of houses. First, there are apartments. In each room, there are 2-4 people. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in one building. Second, there are real houses. People connected to the school can rent these. They usually have 2-4 bedrooms. Alumni often live in these houses. But there are not many of them. Last, there are dorm rooms. Hundreds of students live here. Usually, two people share one room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNext, the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. Stores offer dining and sell school clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because we all care for it!",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be dangerous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The repairs make the lines look like a patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big glass fronts on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water lights up and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car in the driveway for a month once, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children around, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and lawns. My cats love them and have hunted most away from our neighborhood. We also have birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores nearby, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks by the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is very good in New York City. Bensonhurst feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores there. In the past 20 years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on each block. Supermarkets and laundromats are common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are close by. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes walking distance. This makes grocery shopping easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is very mixed. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed. People from many groups play and get along there. There are not many big company buildings. You will find co-op or condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People are nice but noisy. Cars play loud music and speed by. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. There are bullies and thieves. I was bullied a long time ago. Packages also get stolen here sometimes. Even though there is a fine for not cleaning after dogs, people do not follow this rule. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or store. My biggest complaint is dog waste on the ground. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This is on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club. It almost breaks the law in some ways. For some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. That Portland was less known and cheaper. It had creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but as a compliment. Even with many rich people from California moving in, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we lack modern things and issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our items from China. There are many ways to be weird or not normal. But Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others, we have colorful houses and home gardens. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets. In summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone no longer wants. They can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Free boxes hold something special for the person who walks by. This magical feeling when walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, it is for me. I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never get their clothes from a box on the street. Those people might go to goat yoga or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many things. We follow our dreams or think about following them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often mental health problems. The rain and gray clouds much of the year seem to add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. Nobody seems to know what to do about it. Homeless people come for Portland's social services, which are better than most places. But our services are not enough, like everywhere else. The non-homeless people feel both care and hate. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they watch the sun every morning and every evening. Even when I do not think about them or I am too busy with life and work, they are there. They do not change. On days when I feel most stressed, they ask me to see them. When I look at them, they help me feel calm. They give me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I noticed. The university has many beautiful sights like buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I spent hours studying with coffee. You can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. There, you find old buildings made of faded bricks with restaurants and offices. This part of town feels busy and lively, like a big city. But it is not very big. You can quickly find peace again by passing the library. This mix of busy and quiet places makes the city feel exciting and new. You can make many good memories in different parts of town. Like walking past old swings in the park with friends after staying up all night. Or running through downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are a good place to think or cry at two in the morning during a hard time. I have done this often. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, I wondered about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond, the park, and small houses, until I reached a main street. Then the sun shone on the palm trees and lit up the sky. I looked up at the sunrise and saw I was walking north. The mountains were there, as always. They stood tall against the sky, more than any building. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a living area behind some stores. You would not think people live there. But if you go behind the old, empty Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that are busy only during family reunions in summer, you will find a busy community. In this place, there are many apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, placed carefully along the road. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk about them much. But the apartments next to those, and the two other buildings beside them, are different. Few people know about them.\n\nAcross from these homes is a community college's small campus. It is a quiet place by the road where students come with coffee, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers in cars get upset with the slow traffic when many students come. The road meets another road with homes. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has happy-looking porch chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park, running and turning on the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and frown at teens on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking about boys and YouTube by the playground.\n\nNear the park is a strip mall with a sushi place that is not too busy. There is a swimming store and a nail salon too. You can get pool supplies, a manicure, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where you make your own dessert. Teens in the park often hold cups of yogurt with toppings while they skate and think it looks cool. This neighborhood is a piece of American life, where not much changes in the quiet south.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still together. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It looks like many other houses from a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. This dream was once strong, but now it is less clear. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand. They remind us and visitors that the dream is still alive. People try to hold onto it as best they can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The little yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. The youth still play as if their world is all that matters. The public school is almost 90 years old. It still stands. It still gives hope to today's youth. It also makes older people feel nostalgic. There are few churches, and most are empty. But the basketball courts are full. All houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". A large Yemeni family owns it. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in them. They stop only to let cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but kids lost interest. It is now a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It plays old movies at a lower price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new films. Older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. The youth liked the idea, but the elders did not. They said having the expressway would harm our town. The city council denied the request. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best choice.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Houses and stores are mixed together. Some stores have offices. Others are shops, places to eat, or for fun. There are always new places to try. Some shops are big and famous. Others are small and special. These small shops are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to homes and are busy with people. There are also parks nearby. Families with children often visit these parks.\n\nThere are many different groups of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not far, but traffic is bad. Driving 10 miles can take two hours. Most people do not walk because the city is big. We have very bad traffic, and parking is hard to find. Many new buildings are going up. This city is popular, but not everyone is happy about more people and cars.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes here. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in houses or small apartments. Some homes are for one family, others are for two families. My neighborhood has many types of houses. The people are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen this much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane country road. We reached a quarry filled with water. Past it is the small place I live in. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least a half-acre of land. People take pride in their land. In spring, flowers and trees are everywhere. The driveways have Mercedes Benz cars. They shine in the sun after a wash. As we went to my grey stucco home, I saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly face. He spends all day mowing his lawn. You can hear him sing over the mower's sound. People in the neighborhood like him. He was a doctor. Now he is older and not as sharp as he once was. Finally, we reach my home. In the side yard, geese are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters here can be very cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to empty. Trees lose their leaves. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears. The backyard has snow angels and snowmen made by my sister. We often fought as kids. In winter, we used snowballs. We built forts with branches to hide our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You go from farms to small tourist towns here. There are no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is surrounded by water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to visit almost anywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some homes are old, some have been updated, and some are remodeled. Most homes have basements. You can see full basements from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. We have houses of every color. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show what Middle America is like. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have already raised them. \n\nYou will see kids running up and down the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who fits in and who doesn’t. You see someone grilling outside and wave. You see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns are kept in good shape. No leaves are piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood. But it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. \n\nOur town has a county sheriff’s department and jail nearby. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers call the names of players. Our small airport is next to that. You can hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. You can go downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group makes sure all houses look good. The front yards have grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big boxes for packages. My house is on the edge of the city, so it is a mix of rural and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools that people can use. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking trails for walking or running. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People help each other. We also have some middle-aged and young workers. The city is big in population but feels like a small town. We have many things we need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to places, but there are many shops there. We have expensive grocery stores and discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and trails. If you want to shop, you can drive to many big stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It talked about people who were missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we have learned to save money. We like the smell of old toys and clothes from the market. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to things. The market always has a smell. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you clean it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it is quiet. It is nice to spend an afternoon there. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city. It is home to a big online company for selling and delivery. It still grows. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people ask questions because they care. Here, you do not get into other people's lives. You can keep to yourself, and the city moves like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs always do something. We are more like friends than strangers. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring them their mail and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not a rich area. Most houses are owned or rented by people with low incomes. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello on the street. Crime is higher here than in other parts of town, but still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. This includes shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been affected by crime, except for some things taken from our porch now and then. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the U.S. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But my town has resources to help fight this problem. There are centers for addiction help and training for using Narcan, a drug that can save lives. \n\nThis town has good things too. My son's elementary school is great. The staff, teachers, and support people are excellent. My son has special needs but has not faced bullying. The school has a positive atmosphere, and he loves it. We have an active PTO that plans events for families. Over 20% of the people here are poor. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is left hungry. School fees, supplies, and trips are affordable. \n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They repaved roads and fixed parks. But most changes are in the center and west side of town. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This bothers people in my area. \n\nOverall, I like living here. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are enough stores for my family's needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We cannot imagine living somewhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill with buildings that have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. A block down from here is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see people waiting to get in. There is a big city park a few blocks away. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people put tents on the sidewalk and steps. It rains a lot, making it hard to stay warm. They put tents together in the center of town to stay warm. They are close to a family center where they can wash. What I love about my city is not the old buildings or the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. People still tell stories about that time. People work hard to keep it clean now. They care about their city and block. Some say if you're white, don't walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is an old belief. Maybe I look different enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist in our nation. Hilltop is home to me. I feel alive walking there at night. People are kind and offer help. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when it rains. It is a place where someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is one or two minutes from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other guys from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like swings and slides. They get excited about the park. The park makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are popular as in any suburb. There are many pizza places too. Stores here have what you need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse, like an Indian-owned store if you want Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read on social media or see on the news about others' bad experiences with neighbors, it makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not very expensive. One bar just got a new name. It costs more to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have lower income because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children because an elementary school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener by their door. My boyfriend and I find that funny. It is almost insulting. The buildings near me look old, but they might be nice inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them. I know they are not built well. They are cheap to build but cost a lot to rent. I think this is not fair. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a very cheap restaurant five minutes from my home. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city fixed the road. Now, there is a big sidewalk, and grass on the sides. The area looks nicer now. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut, so there are stumps. There are more trees here than down the road. Behind my apartment is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees on this street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But I cannot blame only them. There are also apartments across the street from me with crime and many people moving in and out. I think I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close. There are two bus stops, so I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are placed apart so they look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. Some evenings, we stand outside and talk while the children play. It feels nice in this modern world full of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. There are fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds around us. \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens and had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog with my purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the change in temperature. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. I looked up at the sky, and the sun came out. It started to rain and a double rainbow appeared. I ran inside, got my camera, and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. \n\nI recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The outside of the houses looks the same, but the inside does not. Some apartments are quite small, which I find odd. I like to walk by the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey at a farm nearby that brays at night. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have been here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a better place with good homes and schools. At first, everything was new and strange, but I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school.\n\nI did not know many of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who live next door. They are nice people and feel like family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun. They got re-married. I caught the white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers! We all danced and had a good time. I also danced with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since, but I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. Now, I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I used to hang out with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and enjoyed life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It calms me and gives me peace. I bring sticks from the store to practice my balance, and sometimes I bring my wooden sword. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played them in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me how to play tennis. We worked hard but had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. The town is called Johnston. It is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the town entrance says this. Most of the land is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. These roofs help keep houses cool in summer. Houses are often not near the road. They are set back with fields in front for animals or crops. \n\nIn the main town, there is one stop light at a crossing. The only stores are here. There are three places for quick food. Hong Kong is a small Chinese restaurant. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant is another. Gary's is a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small family-owned drug store called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only one in town. People often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. The store has been here for many years. It has two movers who deliver furniture. Next to it is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer many services for pets like grooming and bathing. \n\nThere is a small doctor’s office and a vet. They are not in the main town but are well-equipped. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but they are making a 2.5-acre recreation area. This will give families more to do and bring visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. There are not many restaurants. But it is a nice town. It is so small you can pass it quickly without knowing.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is a street that connects two highways. There is more traffic than I like, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs each day. In winter, we sled down a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people and cars coming and going all day. We know the cars people drive here. We notice when we see a new car. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids play on bikes and do other things you might expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters, and me. The girls are eleven and fourteen years old. I think people here are used to us too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill food on our back deck. It smells good. Many people cut grass here. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. There are many trees, so there is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. We do not have much Winter now, so Fall feels longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I work on my truck or other jobs in the garage sometimes. When the garage doors are open, I feel more part of the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have guests from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now it is the same, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has friendly old people. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For nicer stores, you have to travel far. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. Many people work in construction here. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live together safely. My family and I have adapted well. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things about the history and culture of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is a bit different. Most people think of houses and families. But my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like others in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. \n\nLet me tell you about the \"houses\" here. There are three kinds of houses. First, there are apartments. In each room, there are 2-4 people. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in one building. Second, there are real houses. People connected to the school can rent these. They usually have 2-4 bedrooms. Alumni often live in these houses. But there are not many of them. Last, there are dorm rooms. Hundreds of students live here. Usually, two people share one room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNext, the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. Stores offer dining and sell school clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because we all care for it!",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be dangerous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The repairs make the lines look like a patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big glass fronts on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water lights up and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car in the driveway for a month once, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children around, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and lawns. My cats love them and have hunted most away from our neighborhood. We also have birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores nearby, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks by the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is very good in New York City. Bensonhurst feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores there. In the past 20 years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on each block. Supermarkets and laundromats are common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are close by. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes walking distance. This makes grocery shopping easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is very mixed. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed. People from many groups play and get along there. There are not many big company buildings. You will find co-op or condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People are nice but noisy. Cars play loud music and speed by. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. There are bullies and thieves. I was bullied a long time ago. Packages also get stolen here sometimes. Even though there is a fine for not cleaning after dogs, people do not follow this rule. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or store. My biggest complaint is dog waste on the ground. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This is on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club. It almost breaks the law in some ways. For some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. That Portland was less known and cheaper. It had creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but as a compliment. Even with many rich people from California moving in, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we lack modern things and issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our items from China. There are many ways to be weird or not normal. But Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others, we have colorful houses and home gardens. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets. In summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone no longer wants. They can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Free boxes hold something special for the person who walks by. This magical feeling when walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, it is for me. I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never get their clothes from a box on the street. Those people might go to goat yoga or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many things. We follow our dreams or think about following them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often mental health problems. The rain and gray clouds much of the year seem to add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. Nobody seems to know what to do about it. Homeless people come for Portland's social services, which are better than most places. But our services are not enough, like everywhere else. The non-homeless people feel both care and hate. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they watch the sun every morning and every evening. Even when I do not think about them or I am too busy with life and work, they are there. They do not change. On days when I feel most stressed, they ask me to see them. When I look at them, they help me feel calm. They give me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I noticed. The university has many beautiful sights like buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I spent hours studying with coffee. You can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. There, you find old buildings made of faded bricks with restaurants and offices. This part of town feels busy and lively, like a big city. But it is not very big. You can quickly find peace again by passing the library. This mix of busy and quiet places makes the city feel exciting and new. You can make many good memories in different parts of town. Like walking past old swings in the park with friends after staying up all night. Or running through downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are a good place to think or cry at two in the morning during a hard time. I have done this often. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, I wondered about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond, the park, and small houses, until I reached a main street. Then the sun shone on the palm trees and lit up the sky. I looked up at the sunrise and saw I was walking north. The mountains were there, as always. They stood tall against the sky, more than any building. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a living area behind some stores. You would not think people live there. But if you go behind the old, empty Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that are busy only during family reunions in summer, you will find a busy community. In this place, there are many apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, placed carefully along the road. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk about them much. But the apartments next to those, and the two other buildings beside them, are different. Few people know about them.\n\nAcross from these homes is a community college's small campus. It is a quiet place by the road where students come with coffee, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers in cars get upset with the slow traffic when many students come. The road meets another road with homes. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has happy-looking porch chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park, running and turning on the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and frown at teens on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking about boys and YouTube by the playground.\n\nNear the park is a strip mall with a sushi place that is not too busy. There is a swimming store and a nail salon too. You can get pool supplies, a manicure, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where you make your own dessert. Teens in the park often hold cups of yogurt with toppings while they skate and think it looks cool. This neighborhood is a piece of American life, where not much changes in the quiet south.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still together. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It looks like many other houses from a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. This dream was once strong, but now it is less clear. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand. They remind us and visitors that the dream is still alive. People try to hold onto it as best they can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The little yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. The youth still play as if their world is all that matters. The public school is almost 90 years old. It still stands. It still gives hope to today's youth. It also makes older people feel nostalgic. There are few churches, and most are empty. But the basketball courts are full. All houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". A large Yemeni family owns it. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in them. They stop only to let cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but kids lost interest. It is now a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It plays old movies at a lower price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new films. Older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. The youth liked the idea, but the elders did not. They said having the expressway would harm our town. The city council denied the request. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best choice.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Houses and stores are mixed together. Some stores have offices. Others are shops, places to eat, or for fun. There are always new places to try. Some shops are big and famous. Others are small and special. These small shops are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to homes and are busy with people. There are also parks nearby. Families with children often visit these parks.\n\nThere are many different groups of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not far, but traffic is bad. Driving 10 miles can take two hours. Most people do not walk because the city is big. We have very bad traffic, and parking is hard to find. Many new buildings are going up. This city is popular, but not everyone is happy about more people and cars.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes here. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in houses or small apartments. Some homes are for one family, others are for two families. My neighborhood has many types of houses. The people are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen this much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane country road. We reached a quarry filled with water. Past it is the small place I live in. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least a half-acre of land. People take pride in their land. In spring, flowers and trees are everywhere. The driveways have Mercedes Benz cars. They shine in the sun after a wash. As we went to my grey stucco home, I saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly face. He spends all day mowing his lawn. You can hear him sing over the mower's sound. People in the neighborhood like him. He was a doctor. Now he is older and not as sharp as he once was. Finally, we reach my home. In the side yard, geese are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters here can be very cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to empty. Trees lose their leaves. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears. The backyard has snow angels and snowmen made by my sister. We often fought as kids. In winter, we used snowballs. We built forts with branches to hide our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in Rural America, in a small town in Michigan. You go from farms to small tourist towns here. There are no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You must drive to go anywhere. But I live in a beautiful place. My town is surrounded by water. Lake Michigan is on one side, and Lake Charlevoix is on the other. You can find a beach to visit almost anywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are not close together. They are not all the same. Some homes are old, some have been updated, and some are remodeled. Most homes have basements. You can see full basements from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. We have houses of every color. Most houses have yards. Yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for animals. The houses show what Middle America is like. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have already raised them. \n\nYou will see kids running up and down the streets. People walk dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other. You know who fits in and who doesn’t. You see someone grilling outside and wave. You see someone walking their dog and smile. Lawns are kept in good shape. No leaves are piled up. Green grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood. But it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. \n\nOur town has a county sheriff’s department and jail nearby. The Health department is next to it. The city recycling center is down the road. People use these services. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the announcers call the names of players. Our small airport is next to that. You can hear small planes take off and land. You can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. You can go downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only eight blocks away. It is a great place to live.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area. My neighborhood has a homeowner's group. This group makes sure all houses look good. The front yards have grass, small stones, and short driveways. Some have small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. The roads are new and smooth. There are no holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, we have a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to open their mailbox. There are two big boxes for packages. My house is on the edge of the city, so it is a mix of rural and suburb. We have a lot of land. There are many pools that people can use. They are clean and have gates. There are also walking trails for walking or running. Most people here are retired. It is a safe place. People help each other. We also have some middle-aged and young workers. The city is big in population but feels like a small town. We have many things we need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to places, but there are many shops there. We have expensive grocery stores and discount stores. My neighborhood is safe and clean. We have pools and trails. If you want to shop, you can drive to many big stores.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast. It talked about people who were missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment here costs more than a thousand dollars each month. I never heard that story, and neither did my friends. Maybe it is the struggle. Some of my friends cry at night. Things cost a lot, but we have learned to save money. We like the smell of old toys and clothes from the market. We smell less as adults. You might start to smoke, or you just get used to things. The market always has a smell. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in leather even after you clean it. Here, there are three thrift stores close by. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but inside the thrifts, it is quiet. It is nice to spend an afternoon there. Each year, more cars and people come. It is a growing city. It is home to a big online company for selling and delivery. It still grows. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals. People do not ask much from you. You can be alone and quiet. People leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people ask questions because they care. Here, you do not get into other people's lives. You can keep to yourself, and the city moves like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be. The pianist next door and the two singers upstairs always do something. We are more like friends than strangers. We come together for needs, celebrate birthdays, and help each other. I am lucky to be here. I like my neighbors, and they treat me well. I clean up after myself and share food. They do the same. I bring them their mail and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is not a rich area. Most houses are owned or rented by people with low incomes. But the area is not bad. My neighbors are friendly. They smile and say hello on the street. Crime is higher here than in other parts of town, but still low. There have been a few violent crimes near my home in the last ten years. This includes shootings and one killing. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has not been affected by crime, except for some things taken from our porch now and then. \n\nThe town has been affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" in the U.S. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But my town has resources to help fight this problem. There are centers for addiction help and training for using Narcan, a drug that can save lives. \n\nThis town has good things too. My son's elementary school is great. The staff, teachers, and support people are excellent. My son has special needs but has not faced bullying. The school has a positive atmosphere, and he loves it. We have an active PTO that plans events for families. Over 20% of the people here are poor. The school gives free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child is left hungry. School fees, supplies, and trips are affordable. \n\nThe City Council has improved the town's look. They repaved roads and fixed parks. But most changes are in the center and west side of town. The east side, where I live, is often left out. This bothers people in my area. \n\nOverall, I like living here. People are friendly. The schools are great. There are enough stores for my family's needs. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for over 16 years. We cannot imagine living somewhere else.",
            "My neighborhood has a lot of culture. It is on a hill with buildings that have history. I live in a 7-story apartment building across from an old theater. A block down from here is a small arcade bar. Many people go there on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you see people waiting to get in. There is a big city park a few blocks away. It is big for this part of town. Around the park is concrete with tall stairs. In winter, homeless people put tents on the sidewalk and steps. It rains a lot, making it hard to stay warm. They put tents together in the center of town to stay warm. They are close to a family center where they can wash. What I love about my city is not the old buildings or the hills. I love the culture of the people. Hilltop once had a lot of gang violence. People still tell stories about that time. People work hard to keep it clean now. They care about their city and block. Some say if you're white, don't walk around Hilltop at night. I think this is an old belief. Maybe I look different enough, or Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know racism and fear still exist in our nation. Hilltop is home to me. I feel alive walking there at night. People are kind and offer help. It is a place where laundromat owners let me charge my phone when it rains. It is a place where someone gave me $5 and said I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood before I started eighth grade. At first, it was hard to make friends. But I became close to someone who lived two houses away and another person on my street. They do not live here now, but I still have memories. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like a typical American suburb. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and none were taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. A park is one or two minutes from my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other guys from the neighborhood. Once, I got hit in the nose playing football, but good memories are more than bad ones. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like swings and slides. They get excited about the park. The park makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. Within one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are popular as in any suburb. There are many pizza places too. Stores here have what you need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. Some stores are diverse, like an Indian-owned store if you want Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read on social media or see on the news about others' bad experiences with neighbors, it makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars that are fun and not very expensive. One bar just got a new name. It costs more to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people are nice. They are college students or have lower income because the apartments are not expensive. There are many children because an elementary school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors, and I do not want to. They smoke a lot, so the building management put an air freshener by their door. My boyfriend and I find that funny. It is almost insulting. The buildings near me look old, but they might be nice inside. Down the street, there are new apartments. I do not like them. I know they are not built well. They are cheap to build but cost a lot to rent. I think this is not fair. But because they are near campus, they can charge more. There is a very cheap restaurant five minutes from my home. They serve food on paper plates and use the microwave. Across from it is a gas station, which is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city fixed the road. Now, there is a big sidewalk, and grass on the sides. The area looks nicer now. My apartment building has many trees around it. Some trees were cut, so there are stumps. There are more trees here than down the road. Behind my apartment is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street, which is not as nice. The sidewalks are broken, and the buildings look shabby. There are many trees on this street, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime happens at an apartment complex on that street. But I cannot blame only them. There are also apartments across the street from me with crime and many people moving in and out. I think I like where I live. It is affordable, and there are many useful places nearby. I like that the university is close. There are two bus stops, so I can get to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a dead-end street. They are placed apart so they look like single houses. Each house is yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. Some evenings, we stand outside and talk while the children play. It feels nice in this modern world full of machines and computers. It is like going back in time. There are fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds around us. \n\nThis season, we have tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens and had to find shelter. I sat in my bathtub holding my small dog with my purse and pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking and nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the change in temperature. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted on the hot pavement. I looked up at the sky, and the sun came out. It started to rain and a double rainbow appeared. I ran inside, got my camera, and took pictures to share online. My friends and family were amazed, and so was I. The streets stayed quiet for an hour until people came home. Then, life went back to normal with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. \n\nI recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment like everyone else. The outside of the houses looks the same, but the inside does not. Some apartments are quite small, which I find odd. I like to walk by the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a big bullfrog. This is a great place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. There is even a donkey at a farm nearby that brays at night. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I have been here for about ten years, so I can share what I know. When I first came to my neighborhood, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. We moved to a better place with good homes and schools. At first, everything was new and strange, but I got used to it. I made new friends and also some enemies at school.\n\nI did not know many of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who live next door. They are nice people and feel like family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun. They got re-married. I caught the white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but not the flowers! We all danced and had a good time. I also danced with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I have not seen her since, but I hope she is doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. Now, I have a GPS, so I can explore more. I used to hang out with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and enjoyed life. Sometimes, I go to the park to enjoy nature. It calms me and gives me peace. I bring sticks from the store to practice my balance, and sometimes I bring my wooden sword. There is also a basketball and tennis court. I have not played them in a long time, but it is nice to have them. My dad and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me how to play tennis. We worked hard but had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a small town. It is in South Carolina. The town is called Johnston. It is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The sign at the town entrance says this. Most of the land is farmland with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main town are far apart. Most houses have two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. These roofs help keep houses cool in summer. Houses are often not near the road. They are set back with fields in front for animals or crops. \n\nIn the main town, there is one stop light at a crossing. The only stores are here. There are three places for quick food. Hong Kong is a small Chinese restaurant. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant is another. Gary's is a small burger place. There was a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small family-owned drug store called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are known for Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only one in town. People often go to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most groceries. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday items and is busy all day. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. A kind woman runs it. The store has been here for many years. It has two movers who deliver furniture. Next to it is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer many services for pets like grooming and bathing. \n\nThere is a small doctor’s office and a vet. They are not in the main town but are well-equipped. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students go to the next town for middle and high school. There are no parks, but they are making a 2.5-acre recreation area. This will give families more to do and bring visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. There are not many restaurants. But it is a nice town. It is so small you can pass it quickly without knowing.",
            "I live in a suburb in a small town in Tennessee. It is a street that connects two highways. There is more traffic than I like, but it is a quiet place. Not many people move in or out. I know most of the people here. People do yard work and other jobs each day. In winter, we sled down a hill nearby. Our house is at the front corner of the street. We see people and cars coming and going all day. We know the cars people drive here. We notice when we see a new car. Some neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs. Kids play on bikes and do other things you might expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us: my wife, my two daughters, and me. The girls are eleven and fourteen years old. I think people here are used to us too. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we grill food on our back deck. It smells good. Many people cut grass here. You can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. There are many trees, so there is a lot of shade. In Fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them each year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It shows Fall is here. We do not have much Winter now, so Fall feels longer. Our garage is at the back of the house. We seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I work on my truck or other jobs in the garage sometimes. When the garage doors are open, I feel more part of the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet here. At Thanksgiving, some families have guests from out of town. There are more cars then. It is the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street was not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you might not understand what it is like to always see brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out. Now it is the same, but there are many new houses. This place looks more like a city every day. Most people here are friendly, but like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has friendly old people. The stores here are mostly chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For nicer stores, you have to travel far. I do not see any Whole Foods or stores like that. Many people work in construction here. This is because there is still a lot of open space to build. I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and do not want to go back. I work in construction too. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals here. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live together safely. My family and I have adapted well. I have three children. They like lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch them. We have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to see the desert. Plan your visit during the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair has many fun activities. You can also visit Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you like natural history, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things about the history and culture of Victorville.",
            "When I talk about my neighborhood, my answer is a bit different. Most people think of houses and families. But my neighborhood is my college campus. The people in my dorm are my community. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like others in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. \n\nLet me tell you about the \"houses\" here. There are three kinds of houses. First, there are apartments. In each room, there are 2-4 people. Each floor has 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors. So, about 20 people live in one building. Second, there are real houses. People connected to the school can rent these. They usually have 2-4 bedrooms. Alumni often live in these houses. But there are not many of them. Last, there are dorm rooms. Hundreds of students live here. Usually, two people share one room. Dorms are the most common housing here.\n\nNow, about the people. My school is proud of its diversity. People from many cultures and ages live here. Most staff live in the houses. New students stay in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nNext, the stores and parks. My school is like a small town. It has many stores and one park. Stores offer dining and sell school clothes and groceries. You can find everything you need here. The park is a place for everyone. It is clean and safe because we all care for it!",
            "There are not many sidewalks where I live. Everything goes down, and my house is at the top of the steepest hill in the area. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road has holes in some places and can be dangerous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn out. It rains and storms a lot here, so branches and other things often hit the power lines. The repairs make the lines look like a patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around. But people here do not like the trees. They try to cut down as many as they can because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big glass fronts on the second floor to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water lights up and the sky turns orange. But it is cloudy most of the time, so you mostly see the sun through a haze. Most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car in the driveway for a month once, and it turned green with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. There are not many children around, even though there is a school a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many are retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It is common to see them sitting on lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come into your house. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it out. Rabbits run wild around here. Some are big, and gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and lawns. My cats love them and have hunted most away from our neighborhood. We also have birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. But the neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores nearby, but if you go downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants with fresh seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks by the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side clearly, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is very good in New York City. Bensonhurst feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores there. In the past 20 years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurst. You will see an Asian store on each block. Supermarkets and laundromats are common. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and they are close by. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes walking distance. This makes grocery shopping easy. Bensonhurst is not only Asian. It is very mixed. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big businesses are Asian-owned. There is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for kids. Parks in New York City are very mixed. People from many groups play and get along there. There are not many big company buildings. You will find co-op or condo apartments. Most homes are two-family houses. People are nice but noisy. Cars play loud music and speed by. If you visit at night, be careful. The area is mostly safe, but people can be unpredictable. There are bullies and thieves. I was bullied a long time ago. Packages also get stolen here sometimes. Even though there is a fine for not cleaning after dogs, people do not follow this rule. You will see dog waste on your way to the train or store. My biggest complaint is dog waste on the ground. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to know about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The town's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". This is on the back of a building that is a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club. It almost breaks the law in some ways. For some, this slogan is a reminder of the Portland in the 90s and early 2000s. That Portland was less known and cheaper. It had creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a call to come to Portland. Here, people may call you weird, but as a compliment. Even with many rich people from California moving in, Portland is still weird. Weird does not always mean accepting, but it means accepting things that are not usually accepted. Weird does not mean we lack modern things and issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our items from China. There are many ways to be weird or not normal. But Portland also has normal things. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe weird means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others, we have colorful houses and home gardens. There are flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets. In summer, we have free boxes. Free boxes are usually cardboard boxes with items someone no longer wants. They can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often have clothes and books, but they can have anything. Free boxes hold something special for the person who walks by. This magical feeling when walking in a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, it is for me. I am just one type of weird among many. Some people here would never get their clothes from a box on the street. Those people might go to goat yoga or Timbers soccer games. Portland is full of people who love many things. We follow our dreams or think about following them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems are often mental health problems. The rain and gray clouds much of the year seem to add to this. Portland also has a homelessness problem. Nobody seems to know what to do about it. Homeless people come for Portland's social services, which are better than most places. But our services are not enough, like everywhere else. The non-homeless people feel both care and hate. In this way, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they watch the sun every morning and every evening. Even when I do not think about them or I am too busy with life and work, they are there. They do not change. On days when I feel most stressed, they ask me to see them. When I look at them, they help me feel calm. They give me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing I noticed. The university has many beautiful sights like buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the most special. The rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafés where I spent hours studying with coffee. You can walk or take the bus to the downtown area. There, you find old buildings made of faded bricks with restaurants and offices. This part of town feels busy and lively, like a big city. But it is not very big. You can quickly find peace again by passing the library. This mix of busy and quiet places makes the city feel exciting and new. You can make many good memories in different parts of town. Like walking past old swings in the park with friends after staying up all night. Or running through downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. But there are also hard memories, as in all places. The ponds are a good place to think or cry at two in the morning during a hard time. I have done this often. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, I wondered about my purpose in life. I walked past the pond, the park, and small houses, until I reached a main street. Then the sun shone on the palm trees and lit up the sky. I looked up at the sunrise and saw I was walking north. The mountains were there, as always. They stood tall against the sky, more than any building. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It is a living area behind some stores. You would not think people live there. But if you go behind the old, empty Whole Foods and walk past the hotels that are busy only during family reunions in summer, you will find a busy community. In this place, there are many apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, placed carefully along the road. The first apartments have been in the news for bad reasons, so we will not talk about them much. But the apartments next to those, and the two other buildings beside them, are different. Few people know about them.\n\nAcross from these homes is a community college's small campus. It is a quiet place by the road where students come with coffee, yawning early in the morning. The gates open for them one by one. Drivers in cars get upset with the slow traffic when many students come. The road meets another road with homes. There is a park on one side and a center for people with broken bones on the other. The center has happy-looking porch chairs and a fan that moves the warm air. Children play in the park, running and turning on the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Old people walk their dogs and frown at teens on skateboards. They nod at the girls talking about boys and YouTube by the playground.\n\nNear the park is a strip mall with a sushi place that is not too busy. There is a swimming store and a nail salon too. You can get pool supplies, a manicure, and eat chicken all in one place. There is also a frozen yogurt shop where you make your own dessert. Teens in the park often hold cups of yogurt with toppings while they skate and think it looks cool. This neighborhood is a piece of American life, where not much changes in the quiet south.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are for single families. Some homes are split into two, but they are still together. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It looks like many other houses from a time when living in the suburbs was a dream for Americans. This dream was once strong, but now it is less clear. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still stand. They remind us and visitors that the dream is still alive. People try to hold onto it as best they can. People do not feel as hopeful as before. The little yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there is still a car or two in every driveway. The youth still play as if their world is all that matters. The public school is almost 90 years old. It still stands. It still gives hope to today's youth. It also makes older people feel nostalgic. There are few churches, and most are empty. But the basketball courts are full. All houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\". A large Yemeni family owns it. They might be the only Arab family here. Most people in my neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Kids play football in them. They stop only to let cars pass. Most people in my neighborhood have lived here for many years. They can tell stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but kids lost interest. It is now a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater. It plays old movies at a lower price. Young people do not like it because it does not show new films. Older people like it. They think it is a good price for a night out without kids. There is one expressway that goes through my town. The exit and entrance are in the next town. There was once a plan to get an exit for our town. The youth liked the idea, but the elders did not. They said having the expressway would harm our town. The city council denied the request. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best choice.",
            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood has many different kinds of people. Houses and stores are mixed together. Some stores have offices. Others are shops, places to eat, or for fun. There are always new places to try. Some shops are big and famous. Others are small and special. These small shops are in malls and on the streets. The streets are close to homes and are busy with people. There are also parks nearby. Families with children often visit these parks.\n\nThere are many different groups of people here. We have an LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish group, and people from the former Soviet Union. Further out, there are more communities like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. They are not far, but traffic is bad. Driving 10 miles can take two hours. Most people do not walk because the city is big. We have very bad traffic, and parking is hard to find. Many new buildings are going up. This city is popular, but not everyone is happy about more people and cars.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes here. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in houses or small apartments. Some homes are for one family, others are for two families. My neighborhood has many types of houses. The people are of all ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. It is not a close community now, but I remember playing outside with friends when I was young.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She was surprised by the open land. She was from a town where the store was close to her house. She had never seen this much open space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She then understood who I was and where I came from. We drove down a two-lane country road. We reached a quarry filled with water. Past it is the small place I live in. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least a half-acre of land. People take pride in their land. In spring, flowers and trees are everywhere. The driveways have Mercedes Benz cars. They shine in the sun after a wash. As we went to my grey stucco home, I saw my Korean neighbor. He is always outside with a friendly face. He spends all day mowing his lawn. You can hear him sing over the mower's sound. People in the neighborhood like him. He was a doctor. Now he is older and not as sharp as he once was. Finally, we reach my home. In the side yard, geese are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that goes to the quarry. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from nearby farms. Across a small bridge is a place with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree forts and chased animals. There was always something to do. Winters here can be very cold but beautiful. The yard changes from green to empty. Trees lose their leaves. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears. The backyard has snow angels and snowmen made by my sister. We often fought as kids. In winter, we used snowballs. We built forts with branches to hide our snowballs. In our wonderland, we played pretend. We were just kids without a care in the world."
