            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan, far from big cities. Here, farms meet small towns that welcome visitors. We do not have large stores or many restaurants. You must drive to get anywhere you need to go.\n\nStill, I live in one of the most beautiful places in America. My town sits between two large lakes - Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find many beaches to enjoy the water.\n\nIn my part of town, the houses stand far apart. Each house looks different and many are old. Most have rooms under the ground that you can see from the street. The houses come in many colors, and most have big yards. Children play on swings and jump on trampolines in these yards. Some people grow plants for food or keep animals behind fences.\n\nThe people who live here work hard and raise families. Every day, you see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs or ride bikes. Neighbors know each other well. They wave and smile when they meet. Everyone keeps their grass cut and their yards clean.\n\nThis is not the most beautiful place, but it is good for families. It is quiet and safe. Near my house, you can walk to important places like the police building and the health office. There are fields where people play ball games. Small planes fly from our town's airport. Children can ride bikes to get ice cream or go to the park.\n\nThis is a very good place to live.",
            "I live in a planned neighborhood in the outer part of a city. There is a group that makes rules for all the houses here. When you come into our area, you see many houses that look alike. Each house has a small green yard in front with rocks and small trees. Every house has space for two cars. The roads are very smooth and clean.\n\nMost houses have one floor, but some have two floors. We do not have mailboxes in front of our houses. Instead, we all get our mail from a group of boxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail, and there are special boxes for bigger things that come in the mail.\n\nMy neighborhood is between city and country areas. We have a lot of space here. There are several swimming pools that everyone who lives here can use. The pools have gates around them. We also have paths where people can walk their dogs or take walks. You can exercise here without going to a special place.\n\nMany older people who have stopped working live here. It is very safe, and people watch out for each other. Some younger working people live here too. Our city is big when you count the people, but it feels small. We have one shopping center. It is not very big, but it works well for us. \n\nIt takes about fifteen minutes by car to get to stores. We have many different kinds of stores. Some sell healthy food at high prices, and others sell fewer things for less money. \n\nMy neighborhood is a good place to live. It is safe and clean. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. While stores are not very close, we can drive to any store we need.",
            "I first learned about my home while listening to a radio show about missing people. This surprised me. Most homes in this area cost more than one thousand dollars each month to live in. None of my friends knew about these stories either. Life can be hard here. Some of my friends cry at night because things cost so much money. We have learned to live with less.\n\nThe smell of used things becomes normal. Old toys and clothes from second-hand stores have a special smell. As you get older, you notice smells less. Some people start smoking. Others just get used to how things are. The smell of old books on an unused piano becomes normal. Even after washing, the smell stays in things made of leather.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk to them all. There are also two places that sell used things to help people in need, a library, a store with rare books, and a shop with interesting old things. Many cars and people fill the streets every morning in the center of town. But inside these stores, it is very quiet. It is nice to spend time there.\n\nMore people come to our city every year. They say our city is growing. A big company that sells things on the internet has its main office here. This reminds me of New York City. Everyone follows their own path, and no one asks too many questions. You can be by yourself, and people will let you be. It is not like the southern part of our country, where asking about others shows you care.\n\nI live near people who play piano and sing. We have become friends instead of just people who live near each other. We help each other, share happy times, and support each other when sad things happen. I am lucky to be here. My neighbors are kind, and I try to be kind too. We share food and help with mail. Even though I live in a big city that can feel cold, my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town near a big city in the middle of America. My part of town, on the east side, is where many people with less money live. Houses here do not cost much, and most people rent them. Still, it is a nice place. People who live near me are friendly and say hello when I walk by.\n\nWhile crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, it is still mostly safe. There have been some bad events near my home in the past ten years, including some shootings. Our neighbors lost their son last year when he was shot near a local bar. My family has been lucky, though we sometimes lose small things from our front steps if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nLike many places in America, our town has problems with dangerous drugs. Many people have died from taking bad medicine. However, there are places here that help people who want to stop using drugs. They also teach families how to help loved ones who might take too much.\n\nEven with these problems, there are many good things about my town. My son goes to a very good school. The teachers and other workers there are wonderful. Even though my son has special needs, other children are kind to him, and he is very happy there. Parents and teachers work together to make the school better. Because many families here do not have much money, all children get free food at school. No one is treated badly because they cannot pay, and school activities do not cost much.\n\nThe town leaders have made many things look better. They fixed roads and made parks nicer. But most of these changes happened in the middle of town and on the west side, where the stores are. The east side, where I live, often gets left out. This makes people in my area unhappy.\n\nStill, I like living here. People are nice, the schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our house may not be worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for more than 16 years, and we want to stay here.",
            "I live in a special part of town called Hilltop. It sits on high ground, with many old buildings around it. My home is in a tall building across from a theater. Down the street, there is a place where people play games and drink. Many people come there when the weather is warm.\n\nNear my home is a city park. It is big, with concrete walls and steps around it. In winter, people who have no homes put their tents on the steps and near the sidewalk. It does not snow much here, but it rains a lot. These people stay close to each other to keep warm. They can also walk to a place where they can wash.\n\nWhat makes this area special is not just the old buildings or how it looks. It is the people who live here. Years ago, Hilltop was known as a dangerous place. The government tried to make it safer. People still tell stories about those times.\n\nToday, people work hard to keep the area clean and safe. Some say white people should not walk here at night. I think this idea comes from old fears. Maybe because my skin is not fully white, or maybe because I am now part of this community, I feel safe here.\n\nThis place shows that our country still has problems with how people think about each other. But Hilltop is my home. People here are kind. Once, when I needed help, the person at the laundry place let me stay late to charge my phone. Another time, when I was sitting alone in the rain, someone gave me money and told me I matter.\n\nNo matter where I go, Hilltop will always be my home.",
            "I came to live in this area when I was ready to start my last year of middle school. At first, it was not easy to find friends, but I became close with two boys who lived on my street. They have moved away now, but I still remember our time together. Most people who lived here when I first came still live here today.\n\nMy area looks like many other places where Americans live outside big cities. There are many houses with two floors. When the weather is warm, I can hear children playing outside. Most days are quiet here. I have never had trouble with anyone who lives nearby. People here leave you alone unless you need help. When I get things sent to my house, no one takes them. I feel safe with my neighbors.\n\nThere is a small park very close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played many games there with other boys, like basketball and football. Once, I got hurt playing football there, but most memories are good. Now, I go there with my young cousins. They love to play on the swings and slides. They get very happy when we talk about going to the park. When I go there now, it makes me think about old times.\n\nMany different kinds of people live here. You can find food from many places nearby. Within a short walk, you can get Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. Many people now use their phones to have food brought to them. There are also many places that sell quick food and pizza.\n\nYou can find all the stores you need here. There are places to clean clothes, drug stores, and a big food store. There is even a store that sells Indian food and things to make Indian meals at home.\n\nI really like living in this area. When I read about problems other people have where they live, I am very happy with my neighborhood.",
            "I live near my college, which makes me happy. The area has many apartment buildings and some places to eat and drink that do not cost too much. There is one bar with a new name that costs more, but it is still okay to visit. Most people who live here are nice. Many are students or people who do not have much money, as the apartments are not expensive. There are many children around because there is a school close by.\n\nI do not know the people who live next to me, and that is fine. They smoke a lot, so the building owners put something in the hall to make the air smell better. My friend and I think this is funny. Most buildings here are old on the outside but some look better inside. There are new apartments down the street, but they were not built well. They cost a lot because they are near school.\n\nThere is a very cheap eating place near me where they serve food on paper plates. Next to it is a gas station. The city fixed the street last summer, adding new walking paths and grass, which made things look better. Many trees grow around my building, though some were cut down. Behind my building are more trees and more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine, 43rd Street, does not look as nice. The walking paths there are broken, and the buildings do not look good. The trees there help hide how the buildings look. Bad things sometimes happen in that area, and also across from where I live.\n\nStill, I like living here. I can pay for it, and everything I need is close. I like that I can walk to school, and I can take a bus to the store or to the center of town.",
            "I live in a special group of houses. Each house is actually two homes put together, but they look like single homes. They all have yellow walls, white front areas, and green metal tops. Most people who live here are friends. In the evening, we often meet and talk while children play with their toys or draw with chalk on the ground. Sometimes they fly kites, too.\n\nLiving here feels like going back to an earlier time, away from today's world of computers. We have fields and trees all around us, with blue sky and white clouds above. The only bad thing is that we sometimes get warnings about strong storms. Last night, we heard loud warning sounds telling us to find safe places to hide.\n\nI went to my bathroom with my small dog, some soft things to sit on, and my bag. My big dog stayed in the living room, making loud sounds because he was afraid. Outside, ice fell from the sky, and then the road made steam because the weather got much cooler very fast. When the storm ended, the sun came out while it was still raining, and two beautiful colored lines appeared in the sky. I took pictures to show my friends.\n\nAfter an hour, people came back outside. Mothers watched their children play while food was cooking. I moved here from the north, and I like how people talk here in the south. My home has two rooms for sleeping and two rooms for washing. All homes look the same outside, but they are different inside.\n\nI enjoy walking in the big field behind my house. There is a small lake there, but we cannot swim in it. I see deer sometimes, and in the morning, I hear big frogs making sounds. I live forty minutes away from the big city. Every morning, I hear farm birds making their morning sounds. There is even a special animal like a horse that makes loud sounds in the evening. I am very happy I found this nice place to live.",
            "I have lived in this area for ten years and would like to share my story. When we first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I felt very sad. I cried because I missed my old friends. However, my parents wanted better things for me and my little sister. They chose this area because it had better houses and a good high school.\n\nOver time, I made new friends at school. I did not know many people who lived near us, except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, who live next door. They became like family to us. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was a very happy day. At the wedding, I caught the small white band that Ms. Veda threw from her leg. We danced and had fun with their daughter Marsharii, though I have not seen her since then.\n\nOur area is like a maze, but now I use a map system to find my way. I often spent time with my friends Kason and Curtis playing games. I also like going to the park. Being in nature makes me feel calm and peaceful. I practice keeping my balance with sticks I bought from the store. Sometimes I bring my wooden practice sword.\n\nThe park has places to play basketball and tennis. While I have not played these sports lately, it is good to know they are there. My father taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many good memories here. I believe even better times are coming in the future.",
            "I live in Johnston, a small town in South Carolina. While it may look like many other towns, it is special because of its peaches. In fact, our town calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, and we show this proudly on our welcome sign.\n\nMost of our land is used for growing peaches or raising cows. Houses outside the town center sit far apart from each other. Many have two floors with metal or gray tops to help stay cool in the hot summer. These homes often sit far from the road, with fields in front for animals or growing food.\n\nIn the middle of town, we have one traffic light where four roads meet. This is where you find our few stores. We have three places to eat: a Chinese family restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican place called Fiesta, and a burger shop called Gary's.\n\nWe have a small drug store called Maxwell and Halford, known for its special cola drinks. Our only food store is IGA, but it is expensive. Many people drive to the bigger town of Batesburg-Leesville to shop at Walmart. The busiest store in town is Dollar General, which sells many everyday things.\n\nThere is a furniture store called Possibilities, run by a friendly woman everyone knows. Next door is Clark's, where people can take their pets for cleaning and care. We have one doctor's office and one animal doctor's office, both small but good at helping our town's people.\n\nJohnston has one school for young children. Older students must go to school in another town. We do not have a park yet, but the town is building one that will be quite big. We hope this will give families more things to do and bring new people to our town.\n\nWhile we do not have movies, games, or many restaurants, Johnston is still a nice place. It is so small that you might miss it if you drive through too fast!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is on a street that connects two big roads. Many cars pass by our house each day. Still, it is mostly quiet here. People stay in their homes for many years, so we know most of our neighbors well.\n\nPeople here spend time working in their yards. In winter, children ride sleds down a nearby hill. Our house sits at the front of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. We know which cars belong here, and we notice when we see new ones.\n\nSome people walk for exercise or with their dogs. Children ride bikes in the street. My family stays home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us - my wife, our two daughters who are eleven and fourteen, and me. We play outside often, even when it rains.\n\nSometimes we cook food outside on our back deck. The smell of cooking food is very nice. From spring to fall, someone is always cutting grass. You can hear lawn mowers almost every day until the cold comes.\n\nWe have many trees in our area. This gives us nice shade, but it also means many leaves fall in autumn. We must clean up these leaves and burn them each year. I like how burning leaves smell. It tells us autumn is here. Recently, winters have been warm, so it feels like autumn lasts longer.\n\nOur car space is behind our house, so we rarely use the front door. When I work on my truck in the car space, I can see and hear what happens in our area. During special days like Thanksgiving and Christmas, it is quiet except for visiting cars. Many families have guests, so more cars park on our street.\n\nI am happy living here. If fewer cars used our street as a way to other places, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the high desert where there is mostly brown dirt everywhere you look. Green grass is rare here because water costs too much. When I moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Today, there are more houses, but they are still spread out. Our area is growing into a bigger town, like many other places.\n\nMost people here are friendly. Like all towns, some areas are better than others. I live among nice older people in a good area. We have regular stores that you find in many places, but no expensive shops. To find special stores, we must drive far.\n\nMany people here work building houses and buildings. This is because our town still has much empty land to build on. This worries me because I like our town as it is now. I moved away from a big city and want to stay in a smaller place. I work in building too, putting up walls and ceilings.\n\nWhat I really like here are the animals. The desert is beautiful in its own way. Many special animals and plants live here, and we must protect them. People who live here should learn about these desert animals to live safely with them. My three children love the desert animals, especially the lizards and insects. They often try to catch them to look at them.\n\nOur town, Victorville, has some interesting places to visit. The San Bernardino County Fair comes every year and is fun for families. Near us is Wrightwood, where people can see snow and learn winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum shows interesting things from our area's past, including rocks, old bones, Native American items, and things that tell how our town grew.",
            "My neighborhood is different from what most people might describe. I live on a college campus, and my main community is the people in my dormitory building. The larger campus area is also part of what I think of as my neighborhood.\n\nEven though this is not a usual neighborhood, it has many of the same things you would find in other places. There are places to live, people, shops, and a park.\n\nThere are three different kinds of places where people live here. First, there are apartment buildings. In these, two to four people share one room, and there are four to six rooms on each floor. Most apartment buildings have two floors, so about twenty people live in each one. Second, there are regular houses that people who work at or graduated from the school can rent. These houses usually have two to four bedrooms, but there are not many of them. Third, there are the dormitory buildings, which are the most common. In these buildings, hundreds of students live, usually with two people sharing one room.\n\nThe people who live here come from many different places and cultures. The school workers usually live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory buildings, while older students often live in the apartments.\n\nOur neighborhood has many stores and a park. You can find places to eat, buy clothes, and get food from grocery stores. Everything we need is right here in our neighborhood. The park is a place where everyone can spend time outside. All of us who live here help keep it clean and safe.",
            "I live in a place with few walking paths. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. Many people who exercise like to run up this hill. Since there are no walking paths, people must walk on the road. The road has holes and can be dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe power lines above look old and broken. It rains a lot here, and falling tree parts often break the power lines. Workers must fix them often, making them look strange.\n\nThere are many tall green trees here. But people do not like these trees because they block the view of the water. That is why houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows on their second floors to see the water below. When the sun goes down, the water looks bright and the sky turns orange. Most days are gray and wet, though. Green plant growth covers everything: house tops, cars, and metal bars. Once, I left my car outside for a month. When I came back, it was green all over. It took three hours to clean.\n\nNot many young people live here, even though there is a school nearby. Most people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Instead of children, people have dogs. You often see dogs in yards or running in the street. Sometimes they even come into houses if doors are left open. I found one in my living room once and had to make it leave.\n\nThere are many wild rabbits here. They are big, and people who grow plants do not like them because they dig holes in the ground. My cats hunt these rabbits. We also have many birds: small ones, tiny fast ones that drink flower water, and big hunting birds that sometimes fly by until black birds chase them away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the water, you can find places to eat fresh fish. There is not much sand by the water, but you can throw rocks into it. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side even when the air is not clear.",
            "Bensonhurst is a part of Brooklyn that is easy to find. You can get there using public transportation, which many people in New York City use. The area feels like a city neighborhood.\n\nToday, many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. In the past twenty years, more Asian families have moved here. You will see many Asian-owned stores on every street. There are many food stores and places to wash clothes. Local people like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and the stores are close to their homes. Near my house, there are four Asian food stores that I can walk to in two minutes.\n\nThe area has people from many different places. Many families came from other countries, and their children were born here. While many businesses are owned by Asian people, the neighborhood has other people too.\n\nThere is a nice park nearby that was fixed up recently. It has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, places to play handball, and a playground for children. In summer, children can play in the water. People from different backgrounds play together here.\n\nMost people live in two-family houses. There are some tall buildings where people can buy or rent homes. The people are friendly, but it can be loud. Cars often play loud music, and some drivers make noise with their cars early in the morning.\n\nAt night, you should be careful. While the area is mostly safe, some people might cause problems. There are bullies and people who steal. Someone once hurt me here years ago. Today, people sometimes steal packages left outside homes.\n\nOne problem is that some people do not clean up after their dogs. Even though there is a fine in New York City for this, you will see dog waste on the streets when you walk to the train or store. This makes walking around unpleasant, so watch where you step!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city with its own way of being different. On a building that serves food, drinks, and music, you can see the words \"Keep Portland Different.\" Some people want to remember how the city was twenty years ago when fewer people lived here and life cost less money. Others see it as a welcome sign to come and be different.\n\nMany people from California have moved here, and new buildings keep going up. Still, Portland stays different. The city accepts things that other places might not. We have normal things too, like stores and businesses. People do yoga, work in offices, and shop like everyone else. Maybe we just worry less about being normal.\n\nIn my area, houses are painted in bright colors. People grow flowers and food in their front yards. In summer, we put boxes on the street with free things inside. These boxes often have clothes and books, but sometimes you find special things you did not expect. Walking through these streets makes Portland special to me.\n\nOther people enjoy Portland in their own ways. Some go to special exercise classes with small farm animals. Others watch our city's soccer team play. Portland has many people who try to make their dreams come true. Some work hard at this, while others talk about it while drinking with friends.\n\nPortland has problems too. Some people use drugs, perhaps because our weather is often dark and rainy. We also have many people without homes. The city tries to help them more than other places do, but it is not enough. Some people want to help those without homes, while others do not. In this way, Portland is like any other city.",
            "The mountains stand in the north. They watch the sun rise and set each day. Even when I am too busy with work to notice them, they remain strong and steady. On hard days when my mind is troubled, the mountains catch my eye. Looking at them helps calm my worried thoughts and gives me strength to continue.\n\nI came here as a student. The mountains near the school were the first thing that caught my attention. The school itself is beautiful, with nice buildings and small lakes with trees. But the mountains are what I love most.\n\nThe town is lovely too. There are many coffee shops where I spent long hours studying. A short bus ride takes you to the old part of town, where old brick buildings hold restaurants and offices. This area feels as busy as a big city. But walk past the library, and you find quiet streets again. Having both busy and quiet areas so close makes this town special, like it wants people to explore it.\n\nI have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends by the old park swings after staying up all night. I remember running to catch movies at the nice theater downtown. But there are sad memories too. I often sat by the small lakes late at night, thinking about life while watching turtles and ducks in the water. I would wonder about my place in the world when things seemed hard to understand.\n\nSometimes I would walk past the lakes, through the quiet streets with small houses, until I reached a main road. One morning, as the sun came up and lit the palm trees, I looked north. There they were, as always - the strong mountains touching the morning sky. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "At first, you might not notice this special place. It sits behind some stores, where most people would not expect to find homes. But if you walk past the empty food store and the hotels that are mostly quiet except in summer, you will find many people living there.\n\nOn these streets, there are several apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like toys in a row. The first building you see has had some problems, so we will not talk about it much. The other buildings next to it are different and special. Most people who live in this area do not know about them.\n\nAcross the street, there is a small college. Every morning at seven, tired students come with their coffee. They enter through big metal gates while people in cars wait, sometimes not very happily.\n\nThe street meets another road where there is a park on one side and a medical center on the other. The medical center has chairs on its front porch and a fan that moves slowly in the warm air. At the park, children play in the grass while bees fly around the flowers. Older people walk their dogs on the paths. They do not like the young people on skateboards but they smile at the girls who talk about boys near the play area.\n\nNext to the park, there are some small stores. You can find a place that serves fish and rice, a store that sells things for swimming pools, and a place where people get their nails done. There is also a store where you can make your own frozen ice cream. Young people often get ice cream there and then go back to the park with their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is like many other American places. It is in the quiet south where things stay the same for a long time.",
            "I want to tell you about where I live. The houses in my area are mostly for one family, though some are split for two families to live in. My house has a small green space in front and a place for cars on the left side. These houses make me think about how people once wanted to live away from the city. Many people still live this way, but it is not as popular as before.\n\nThe people who live here try to keep their houses nice, but it is not easy. Every house has cars parked outside. Children play in the streets as if nothing else matters. The school has been here for many years. It gives young people hope and makes older people remember good times. The churches do not have many people now, but many young people still play basketball.\n\nAll houses look different but feel like home. There is a big food store run by a family from Yemen. Most people who live here are African American. The streets are wide, and children play games, moving only when cars need to pass. Many families have lived here for many years. They tell stories about times when everyone knew their neighbors.\n\nWe once had a place that taught fighting sports, but now it is a drug store. We have a small movie house that shows old films for less money. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it.\n\nA big road passes near our town, but you cannot get on it here. Young people wanted a way to get on the big road from our town, but older people said no. They thought it would hurt our town. We are building a new school now. We need to pick something to represent our town. I think it should be something that shows both old and new ways of life.",
            "I live in a big city where many different kinds of people live close to each other. My area has homes mixed with places where people work and shop. There are many offices, stores, restaurants, and places where people go to have fun.\n\nThere are always new places to eat and shop. Some stores are part of big companies that everyone knows. There are also many small stores owned by local people. These stores are in shopping centers and along the streets near quiet living areas.\n\nThere are parks nearby where families bring their children to play. Many different groups of people live here. We have gay and lesbian people, Jewish people who follow old ways, and people who came from Russia and nearby countries. If you go a little further, you can find areas where Chinese, Korean, and Armenian people live together.\n\nGetting around the city is hard. A ten-mile trip can take two hours when there are many cars on the road. Most people drive cars instead of walking, even to close places. This makes it hard to find places to park, and the roads are always full.\n\nThey are building many new tall houses for people to live in. Some people who already live here are not happy about more people moving in because it means more cars on the roads. We have many kinds of homes here - big houses, small houses, and middle-sized houses where more than one family lives.\n\nPeople of all ages live in my area, but I do not know many of my neighbors well. When I was young, I used to play outside with the children who lived next door, but now people do not spend as much time with their neighbors.",
            "\"What do you see here?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields that went as far as we could see. \"This is all there is!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by how empty it looked. She came from a place where stores were close to her home. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nAs we drove, I told her about growing up in Ohio's farming area. This helped her understand who I am. If you follow the small road, you will find a water-filled hole in the ground. My house is just past it, in a group of homes. The houses are made of brick and have large yards that people keep very nice. In spring, there are many flowers and trees that change with each season.\n\nNice cars sit in the driveways, clean and bright in the sun. Near my grey house lives a man from Korea. He spends much time cutting his grass and singing. People smile when they see him. He used to be a doctor and is now older. He rides his grass-cutting machine all day.\n\nAt my house, birds walk in the yard while our small dog runs after them. Behind the house, there is a small stream of water. You can hear frogs and sometimes cows from nearby farms. Past a wooden bridge I made, there is a beautiful area with trees, plants, and wild flowers. I spent much of my young life there. I built places in trees and played with friends who lived nearby.\n\nThe cold time of year can be hard, but it is very beautiful. The green yard becomes white. Trees that had bright flowers become empty. When snow falls, it makes everything look special. My younger sister made snow shapes on the ground and snow people. As children, we often played in the snow, throwing snow balls at each other. We built snow houses with branches to hide behind. In our own special place, we played without worry. We were just children having fun."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan, far from big cities. Here, farms meet small towns that welcome visitors. We do not have large stores or many restaurants. You must drive to get anywhere you need to go.\n\nStill, I live in one of the most beautiful places in America. My town sits between two large lakes - Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find many beaches to enjoy the water.\n\nIn my part of town, the houses stand far apart. Each house looks different and many are old. Most have rooms under the ground that you can see from the street. The houses come in many colors, and most have big yards. Children play on swings and jump on trampolines in these yards. Some people grow plants for food or keep animals behind fences.\n\nThe people who live here work hard and raise families. Every day, you see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs or ride bikes. Neighbors know each other well. They wave and smile when they meet. Everyone keeps their grass cut and their yards clean.\n\nThis is not the most beautiful place, but it is good for families. It is quiet and safe. Near my house, you can walk to important places like the police building and the health office. There are fields where people play ball games. Small planes fly from our town's airport. Children can ride bikes to get ice cream or go to the park.\n\nThis is a very good place to live.",
            "I live in a planned neighborhood in the outer part of a city. There is a group that makes rules for all the houses here. When you come into our area, you see many houses that look alike. Each house has a small green yard in front with rocks and small trees. Every house has space for two cars. The roads are very smooth and clean.\n\nMost houses have one floor, but some have two floors. We do not have mailboxes in front of our houses. Instead, we all get our mail from a group of boxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail, and there are special boxes for bigger things that come in the mail.\n\nMy neighborhood is between city and country areas. We have a lot of space here. There are several swimming pools that everyone who lives here can use. The pools have gates around them. We also have paths where people can walk their dogs or take walks. You can exercise here without going to a special place.\n\nMany older people who have stopped working live here. It is very safe, and people watch out for each other. Some younger working people live here too. Our city is big when you count the people, but it feels small. We have one shopping center. It is not very big, but it works well for us. \n\nIt takes about fifteen minutes by car to get to stores. We have many different kinds of stores. Some sell healthy food at high prices, and others sell fewer things for less money. \n\nMy neighborhood is a good place to live. It is safe and clean. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. While stores are not very close, we can drive to any store we need.",
            "I first learned about my home while listening to a radio show about missing people. This surprised me. Most homes in this area cost more than one thousand dollars each month to live in. None of my friends knew about these stories either. Life can be hard here. Some of my friends cry at night because things cost so much money. We have learned to live with less.\n\nThe smell of used things becomes normal. Old toys and clothes from second-hand stores have a special smell. As you get older, you notice smells less. Some people start smoking. Others just get used to how things are. The smell of old books on an unused piano becomes normal. Even after washing, the smell stays in things made of leather.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk to them all. There are also two places that sell used things to help people in need, a library, a store with rare books, and a shop with interesting old things. Many cars and people fill the streets every morning in the center of town. But inside these stores, it is very quiet. It is nice to spend time there.\n\nMore people come to our city every year. They say our city is growing. A big company that sells things on the internet has its main office here. This reminds me of New York City. Everyone follows their own path, and no one asks too many questions. You can be by yourself, and people will let you be. It is not like the southern part of our country, where asking about others shows you care.\n\nI live near people who play piano and sing. We have become friends instead of just people who live near each other. We help each other, share happy times, and support each other when sad things happen. I am lucky to be here. My neighbors are kind, and I try to be kind too. We share food and help with mail. Even though I live in a big city that can feel cold, my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town near a big city in the middle of America. My part of town, on the east side, is where many people with less money live. Houses here do not cost much, and most people rent them. Still, it is a nice place. People who live near me are friendly and say hello when I walk by.\n\nWhile crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, it is still mostly safe. There have been some bad events near my home in the past ten years, including some shootings. Our neighbors lost their son last year when he was shot near a local bar. My family has been lucky, though we sometimes lose small things from our front steps if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nLike many places in America, our town has problems with dangerous drugs. Many people have died from taking bad medicine. However, there are places here that help people who want to stop using drugs. They also teach families how to help loved ones who might take too much.\n\nEven with these problems, there are many good things about my town. My son goes to a very good school. The teachers and other workers there are wonderful. Even though my son has special needs, other children are kind to him, and he is very happy there. Parents and teachers work together to make the school better. Because many families here do not have much money, all children get free food at school. No one is treated badly because they cannot pay, and school activities do not cost much.\n\nThe town leaders have made many things look better. They fixed roads and made parks nicer. But most of these changes happened in the middle of town and on the west side, where the stores are. The east side, where I live, often gets left out. This makes people in my area unhappy.\n\nStill, I like living here. People are nice, the schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our house may not be worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for more than 16 years, and we want to stay here.",
            "I live in a special part of town called Hilltop. It sits on high ground, with many old buildings around it. My home is in a tall building across from a theater. Down the street, there is a place where people play games and drink. Many people come there when the weather is warm.\n\nNear my home is a city park. It is big, with concrete walls and steps around it. In winter, people who have no homes put their tents on the steps and near the sidewalk. It does not snow much here, but it rains a lot. These people stay close to each other to keep warm. They can also walk to a place where they can wash.\n\nWhat makes this area special is not just the old buildings or how it looks. It is the people who live here. Years ago, Hilltop was known as a dangerous place. The government tried to make it safer. People still tell stories about those times.\n\nToday, people work hard to keep the area clean and safe. Some say white people should not walk here at night. I think this idea comes from old fears. Maybe because my skin is not fully white, or maybe because I am now part of this community, I feel safe here.\n\nThis place shows that our country still has problems with how people think about each other. But Hilltop is my home. People here are kind. Once, when I needed help, the person at the laundry place let me stay late to charge my phone. Another time, when I was sitting alone in the rain, someone gave me money and told me I matter.\n\nNo matter where I go, Hilltop will always be my home.",
            "I came to live in this area when I was ready to start my last year of middle school. At first, it was not easy to find friends, but I became close with two boys who lived on my street. They have moved away now, but I still remember our time together. Most people who lived here when I first came still live here today.\n\nMy area looks like many other places where Americans live outside big cities. There are many houses with two floors. When the weather is warm, I can hear children playing outside. Most days are quiet here. I have never had trouble with anyone who lives nearby. People here leave you alone unless you need help. When I get things sent to my house, no one takes them. I feel safe with my neighbors.\n\nThere is a small park very close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played many games there with other boys, like basketball and football. Once, I got hurt playing football there, but most memories are good. Now, I go there with my young cousins. They love to play on the swings and slides. They get very happy when we talk about going to the park. When I go there now, it makes me think about old times.\n\nMany different kinds of people live here. You can find food from many places nearby. Within a short walk, you can get Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. Many people now use their phones to have food brought to them. There are also many places that sell quick food and pizza.\n\nYou can find all the stores you need here. There are places to clean clothes, drug stores, and a big food store. There is even a store that sells Indian food and things to make Indian meals at home.\n\nI really like living in this area. When I read about problems other people have where they live, I am very happy with my neighborhood.",
            "I live near my college, which makes me happy. The area has many apartment buildings and some places to eat and drink that do not cost too much. There is one bar with a new name that costs more, but it is still okay to visit. Most people who live here are nice. Many are students or people who do not have much money, as the apartments are not expensive. There are many children around because there is a school close by.\n\nI do not know the people who live next to me, and that is fine. They smoke a lot, so the building owners put something in the hall to make the air smell better. My friend and I think this is funny. Most buildings here are old on the outside but some look better inside. There are new apartments down the street, but they were not built well. They cost a lot because they are near school.\n\nThere is a very cheap eating place near me where they serve food on paper plates. Next to it is a gas station. The city fixed the street last summer, adding new walking paths and grass, which made things look better. Many trees grow around my building, though some were cut down. Behind my building are more trees and more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine, 43rd Street, does not look as nice. The walking paths there are broken, and the buildings do not look good. The trees there help hide how the buildings look. Bad things sometimes happen in that area, and also across from where I live.\n\nStill, I like living here. I can pay for it, and everything I need is close. I like that I can walk to school, and I can take a bus to the store or to the center of town.",
            "I live in a special group of houses. Each house is actually two homes put together, but they look like single homes. They all have yellow walls, white front areas, and green metal tops. Most people who live here are friends. In the evening, we often meet and talk while children play with their toys or draw with chalk on the ground. Sometimes they fly kites, too.\n\nLiving here feels like going back to an earlier time, away from today's world of computers. We have fields and trees all around us, with blue sky and white clouds above. The only bad thing is that we sometimes get warnings about strong storms. Last night, we heard loud warning sounds telling us to find safe places to hide.\n\nI went to my bathroom with my small dog, some soft things to sit on, and my bag. My big dog stayed in the living room, making loud sounds because he was afraid. Outside, ice fell from the sky, and then the road made steam because the weather got much cooler very fast. When the storm ended, the sun came out while it was still raining, and two beautiful colored lines appeared in the sky. I took pictures to show my friends.\n\nAfter an hour, people came back outside. Mothers watched their children play while food was cooking. I moved here from the north, and I like how people talk here in the south. My home has two rooms for sleeping and two rooms for washing. All homes look the same outside, but they are different inside.\n\nI enjoy walking in the big field behind my house. There is a small lake there, but we cannot swim in it. I see deer sometimes, and in the morning, I hear big frogs making sounds. I live forty minutes away from the big city. Every morning, I hear farm birds making their morning sounds. There is even a special animal like a horse that makes loud sounds in the evening. I am very happy I found this nice place to live.",
            "I have lived in this area for ten years and would like to share my story. When we first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I felt very sad. I cried because I missed my old friends. However, my parents wanted better things for me and my little sister. They chose this area because it had better houses and a good high school.\n\nOver time, I made new friends at school. I did not know many people who lived near us, except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, who live next door. They became like family to us. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was a very happy day. At the wedding, I caught the small white band that Ms. Veda threw from her leg. We danced and had fun with their daughter Marsharii, though I have not seen her since then.\n\nOur area is like a maze, but now I use a map system to find my way. I often spent time with my friends Kason and Curtis playing games. I also like going to the park. Being in nature makes me feel calm and peaceful. I practice keeping my balance with sticks I bought from the store. Sometimes I bring my wooden practice sword.\n\nThe park has places to play basketball and tennis. While I have not played these sports lately, it is good to know they are there. My father taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many good memories here. I believe even better times are coming in the future.",
            "I live in Johnston, a small town in South Carolina. While it may look like many other towns, it is special because of its peaches. In fact, our town calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, and we show this proudly on our welcome sign.\n\nMost of our land is used for growing peaches or raising cows. Houses outside the town center sit far apart from each other. Many have two floors with metal or gray tops to help stay cool in the hot summer. These homes often sit far from the road, with fields in front for animals or growing food.\n\nIn the middle of town, we have one traffic light where four roads meet. This is where you find our few stores. We have three places to eat: a Chinese family restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican place called Fiesta, and a burger shop called Gary's.\n\nWe have a small drug store called Maxwell and Halford, known for its special cola drinks. Our only food store is IGA, but it is expensive. Many people drive to the bigger town of Batesburg-Leesville to shop at Walmart. The busiest store in town is Dollar General, which sells many everyday things.\n\nThere is a furniture store called Possibilities, run by a friendly woman everyone knows. Next door is Clark's, where people can take their pets for cleaning and care. We have one doctor's office and one animal doctor's office, both small but good at helping our town's people.\n\nJohnston has one school for young children. Older students must go to school in another town. We do not have a park yet, but the town is building one that will be quite big. We hope this will give families more things to do and bring new people to our town.\n\nWhile we do not have movies, games, or many restaurants, Johnston is still a nice place. It is so small that you might miss it if you drive through too fast!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is on a street that connects two big roads. Many cars pass by our house each day. Still, it is mostly quiet here. People stay in their homes for many years, so we know most of our neighbors well.\n\nPeople here spend time working in their yards. In winter, children ride sleds down a nearby hill. Our house sits at the front of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. We know which cars belong here, and we notice when we see new ones.\n\nSome people walk for exercise or with their dogs. Children ride bikes in the street. My family stays home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us - my wife, our two daughters who are eleven and fourteen, and me. We play outside often, even when it rains.\n\nSometimes we cook food outside on our back deck. The smell of cooking food is very nice. From spring to fall, someone is always cutting grass. You can hear lawn mowers almost every day until the cold comes.\n\nWe have many trees in our area. This gives us nice shade, but it also means many leaves fall in autumn. We must clean up these leaves and burn them each year. I like how burning leaves smell. It tells us autumn is here. Recently, winters have been warm, so it feels like autumn lasts longer.\n\nOur car space is behind our house, so we rarely use the front door. When I work on my truck in the car space, I can see and hear what happens in our area. During special days like Thanksgiving and Christmas, it is quiet except for visiting cars. Many families have guests, so more cars park on our street.\n\nI am happy living here. If fewer cars used our street as a way to other places, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the high desert where there is mostly brown dirt everywhere you look. Green grass is rare here because water costs too much. When I moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Today, there are more houses, but they are still spread out. Our area is growing into a bigger town, like many other places.\n\nMost people here are friendly. Like all towns, some areas are better than others. I live among nice older people in a good area. We have regular stores that you find in many places, but no expensive shops. To find special stores, we must drive far.\n\nMany people here work building houses and buildings. This is because our town still has much empty land to build on. This worries me because I like our town as it is now. I moved away from a big city and want to stay in a smaller place. I work in building too, putting up walls and ceilings.\n\nWhat I really like here are the animals. The desert is beautiful in its own way. Many special animals and plants live here, and we must protect them. People who live here should learn about these desert animals to live safely with them. My three children love the desert animals, especially the lizards and insects. They often try to catch them to look at them.\n\nOur town, Victorville, has some interesting places to visit. The San Bernardino County Fair comes every year and is fun for families. Near us is Wrightwood, where people can see snow and learn winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum shows interesting things from our area's past, including rocks, old bones, Native American items, and things that tell how our town grew.",
            "My neighborhood is different from what most people might describe. I live on a college campus, and my main community is the people in my dormitory building. The larger campus area is also part of what I think of as my neighborhood.\n\nEven though this is not a usual neighborhood, it has many of the same things you would find in other places. There are places to live, people, shops, and a park.\n\nThere are three different kinds of places where people live here. First, there are apartment buildings. In these, two to four people share one room, and there are four to six rooms on each floor. Most apartment buildings have two floors, so about twenty people live in each one. Second, there are regular houses that people who work at or graduated from the school can rent. These houses usually have two to four bedrooms, but there are not many of them. Third, there are the dormitory buildings, which are the most common. In these buildings, hundreds of students live, usually with two people sharing one room.\n\nThe people who live here come from many different places and cultures. The school workers usually live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory buildings, while older students often live in the apartments.\n\nOur neighborhood has many stores and a park. You can find places to eat, buy clothes, and get food from grocery stores. Everything we need is right here in our neighborhood. The park is a place where everyone can spend time outside. All of us who live here help keep it clean and safe.",
            "I live in a place with few walking paths. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. Many people who exercise like to run up this hill. Since there are no walking paths, people must walk on the road. The road has holes and can be dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe power lines above look old and broken. It rains a lot here, and falling tree parts often break the power lines. Workers must fix them often, making them look strange.\n\nThere are many tall green trees here. But people do not like these trees because they block the view of the water. That is why houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows on their second floors to see the water below. When the sun goes down, the water looks bright and the sky turns orange. Most days are gray and wet, though. Green plant growth covers everything: house tops, cars, and metal bars. Once, I left my car outside for a month. When I came back, it was green all over. It took three hours to clean.\n\nNot many young people live here, even though there is a school nearby. Most people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Instead of children, people have dogs. You often see dogs in yards or running in the street. Sometimes they even come into houses if doors are left open. I found one in my living room once and had to make it leave.\n\nThere are many wild rabbits here. They are big, and people who grow plants do not like them because they dig holes in the ground. My cats hunt these rabbits. We also have many birds: small ones, tiny fast ones that drink flower water, and big hunting birds that sometimes fly by until black birds chase them away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the water, you can find places to eat fresh fish. There is not much sand by the water, but you can throw rocks into it. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side even when the air is not clear.",
            "Bensonhurst is a part of Brooklyn that is easy to find. You can get there using public transportation, which many people in New York City use. The area feels like a city neighborhood.\n\nToday, many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. In the past twenty years, more Asian families have moved here. You will see many Asian-owned stores on every street. There are many food stores and places to wash clothes. Local people like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and the stores are close to their homes. Near my house, there are four Asian food stores that I can walk to in two minutes.\n\nThe area has people from many different places. Many families came from other countries, and their children were born here. While many businesses are owned by Asian people, the neighborhood has other people too.\n\nThere is a nice park nearby that was fixed up recently. It has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, places to play handball, and a playground for children. In summer, children can play in the water. People from different backgrounds play together here.\n\nMost people live in two-family houses. There are some tall buildings where people can buy or rent homes. The people are friendly, but it can be loud. Cars often play loud music, and some drivers make noise with their cars early in the morning.\n\nAt night, you should be careful. While the area is mostly safe, some people might cause problems. There are bullies and people who steal. Someone once hurt me here years ago. Today, people sometimes steal packages left outside homes.\n\nOne problem is that some people do not clean up after their dogs. Even though there is a fine in New York City for this, you will see dog waste on the streets when you walk to the train or store. This makes walking around unpleasant, so watch where you step!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city with its own way of being different. On a building that serves food, drinks, and music, you can see the words \"Keep Portland Different.\" Some people want to remember how the city was twenty years ago when fewer people lived here and life cost less money. Others see it as a welcome sign to come and be different.\n\nMany people from California have moved here, and new buildings keep going up. Still, Portland stays different. The city accepts things that other places might not. We have normal things too, like stores and businesses. People do yoga, work in offices, and shop like everyone else. Maybe we just worry less about being normal.\n\nIn my area, houses are painted in bright colors. People grow flowers and food in their front yards. In summer, we put boxes on the street with free things inside. These boxes often have clothes and books, but sometimes you find special things you did not expect. Walking through these streets makes Portland special to me.\n\nOther people enjoy Portland in their own ways. Some go to special exercise classes with small farm animals. Others watch our city's soccer team play. Portland has many people who try to make their dreams come true. Some work hard at this, while others talk about it while drinking with friends.\n\nPortland has problems too. Some people use drugs, perhaps because our weather is often dark and rainy. We also have many people without homes. The city tries to help them more than other places do, but it is not enough. Some people want to help those without homes, while others do not. In this way, Portland is like any other city.",
            "The mountains stand in the north. They watch the sun rise and set each day. Even when I am too busy with work to notice them, they remain strong and steady. On hard days when my mind is troubled, the mountains catch my eye. Looking at them helps calm my worried thoughts and gives me strength to continue.\n\nI came here as a student. The mountains near the school were the first thing that caught my attention. The school itself is beautiful, with nice buildings and small lakes with trees. But the mountains are what I love most.\n\nThe town is lovely too. There are many coffee shops where I spent long hours studying. A short bus ride takes you to the old part of town, where old brick buildings hold restaurants and offices. This area feels as busy as a big city. But walk past the library, and you find quiet streets again. Having both busy and quiet areas so close makes this town special, like it wants people to explore it.\n\nI have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends by the old park swings after staying up all night. I remember running to catch movies at the nice theater downtown. But there are sad memories too. I often sat by the small lakes late at night, thinking about life while watching turtles and ducks in the water. I would wonder about my place in the world when things seemed hard to understand.\n\nSometimes I would walk past the lakes, through the quiet streets with small houses, until I reached a main road. One morning, as the sun came up and lit the palm trees, I looked north. There they were, as always - the strong mountains touching the morning sky. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "At first, you might not notice this special place. It sits behind some stores, where most people would not expect to find homes. But if you walk past the empty food store and the hotels that are mostly quiet except in summer, you will find many people living there.\n\nOn these streets, there are several apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like toys in a row. The first building you see has had some problems, so we will not talk about it much. The other buildings next to it are different and special. Most people who live in this area do not know about them.\n\nAcross the street, there is a small college. Every morning at seven, tired students come with their coffee. They enter through big metal gates while people in cars wait, sometimes not very happily.\n\nThe street meets another road where there is a park on one side and a medical center on the other. The medical center has chairs on its front porch and a fan that moves slowly in the warm air. At the park, children play in the grass while bees fly around the flowers. Older people walk their dogs on the paths. They do not like the young people on skateboards but they smile at the girls who talk about boys near the play area.\n\nNext to the park, there are some small stores. You can find a place that serves fish and rice, a store that sells things for swimming pools, and a place where people get their nails done. There is also a store where you can make your own frozen ice cream. Young people often get ice cream there and then go back to the park with their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is like many other American places. It is in the quiet south where things stay the same for a long time.",
            "I want to tell you about where I live. The houses in my area are mostly for one family, though some are split for two families to live in. My house has a small green space in front and a place for cars on the left side. These houses make me think about how people once wanted to live away from the city. Many people still live this way, but it is not as popular as before.\n\nThe people who live here try to keep their houses nice, but it is not easy. Every house has cars parked outside. Children play in the streets as if nothing else matters. The school has been here for many years. It gives young people hope and makes older people remember good times. The churches do not have many people now, but many young people still play basketball.\n\nAll houses look different but feel like home. There is a big food store run by a family from Yemen. Most people who live here are African American. The streets are wide, and children play games, moving only when cars need to pass. Many families have lived here for many years. They tell stories about times when everyone knew their neighbors.\n\nWe once had a place that taught fighting sports, but now it is a drug store. We have a small movie house that shows old films for less money. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it.\n\nA big road passes near our town, but you cannot get on it here. Young people wanted a way to get on the big road from our town, but older people said no. They thought it would hurt our town. We are building a new school now. We need to pick something to represent our town. I think it should be something that shows both old and new ways of life.",
            "I live in a big city where many different kinds of people live close to each other. My area has homes mixed with places where people work and shop. There are many offices, stores, restaurants, and places where people go to have fun.\n\nThere are always new places to eat and shop. Some stores are part of big companies that everyone knows. There are also many small stores owned by local people. These stores are in shopping centers and along the streets near quiet living areas.\n\nThere are parks nearby where families bring their children to play. Many different groups of people live here. We have gay and lesbian people, Jewish people who follow old ways, and people who came from Russia and nearby countries. If you go a little further, you can find areas where Chinese, Korean, and Armenian people live together.\n\nGetting around the city is hard. A ten-mile trip can take two hours when there are many cars on the road. Most people drive cars instead of walking, even to close places. This makes it hard to find places to park, and the roads are always full.\n\nThey are building many new tall houses for people to live in. Some people who already live here are not happy about more people moving in because it means more cars on the roads. We have many kinds of homes here - big houses, small houses, and middle-sized houses where more than one family lives.\n\nPeople of all ages live in my area, but I do not know many of my neighbors well. When I was young, I used to play outside with the children who lived next door, but now people do not spend as much time with their neighbors.",
            "\"What do you see here?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields that went as far as we could see. \"This is all there is!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by how empty it looked. She came from a place where stores were close to her home. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nAs we drove, I told her about growing up in Ohio's farming area. This helped her understand who I am. If you follow the small road, you will find a water-filled hole in the ground. My house is just past it, in a group of homes. The houses are made of brick and have large yards that people keep very nice. In spring, there are many flowers and trees that change with each season.\n\nNice cars sit in the driveways, clean and bright in the sun. Near my grey house lives a man from Korea. He spends much time cutting his grass and singing. People smile when they see him. He used to be a doctor and is now older. He rides his grass-cutting machine all day.\n\nAt my house, birds walk in the yard while our small dog runs after them. Behind the house, there is a small stream of water. You can hear frogs and sometimes cows from nearby farms. Past a wooden bridge I made, there is a beautiful area with trees, plants, and wild flowers. I spent much of my young life there. I built places in trees and played with friends who lived nearby.\n\nThe cold time of year can be hard, but it is very beautiful. The green yard becomes white. Trees that had bright flowers become empty. When snow falls, it makes everything look special. My younger sister made snow shapes on the ground and snow people. As children, we often played in the snow, throwing snow balls at each other. We built snow houses with branches to hide behind. In our own special place, we played without worry. We were just children having fun."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan, far from big cities. Here, farms meet small towns that welcome visitors. We do not have large stores or many restaurants. You must drive to get anywhere you need to go.\n\nStill, I live in one of the most beautiful places in America. My town sits between two large lakes - Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find many beaches to enjoy the water.\n\nIn my part of town, the houses stand far apart. Each house looks different and many are old. Most have rooms under the ground that you can see from the street. The houses come in many colors, and most have big yards. Children play on swings and jump on trampolines in these yards. Some people grow plants for food or keep animals behind fences.\n\nThe people who live here work hard and raise families. Every day, you see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs or ride bikes. Neighbors know each other well. They wave and smile when they meet. Everyone keeps their grass cut and their yards clean.\n\nThis is not the most beautiful place, but it is good for families. It is quiet and safe. Near my house, you can walk to important places like the police building and the health office. There are fields where people play ball games. Small planes fly from our town's airport. Children can ride bikes to get ice cream or go to the park.\n\nThis is a very good place to live.",
            "I live in a planned neighborhood in the outer part of a city. There is a group that makes rules for all the houses here. When you come into our area, you see many houses that look alike. Each house has a small green yard in front with rocks and small trees. Every house has space for two cars. The roads are very smooth and clean.\n\nMost houses have one floor, but some have two floors. We do not have mailboxes in front of our houses. Instead, we all get our mail from a group of boxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail, and there are special boxes for bigger things that come in the mail.\n\nMy neighborhood is between city and country areas. We have a lot of space here. There are several swimming pools that everyone who lives here can use. The pools have gates around them. We also have paths where people can walk their dogs or take walks. You can exercise here without going to a special place.\n\nMany older people who have stopped working live here. It is very safe, and people watch out for each other. Some younger working people live here too. Our city is big when you count the people, but it feels small. We have one shopping center. It is not very big, but it works well for us. \n\nIt takes about fifteen minutes by car to get to stores. We have many different kinds of stores. Some sell healthy food at high prices, and others sell fewer things for less money. \n\nMy neighborhood is a good place to live. It is safe and clean. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. While stores are not very close, we can drive to any store we need.",
            "I first learned about my home while listening to a radio show about missing people. This surprised me. Most homes in this area cost more than one thousand dollars each month to live in. None of my friends knew about these stories either. Life can be hard here. Some of my friends cry at night because things cost so much money. We have learned to live with less.\n\nThe smell of used things becomes normal. Old toys and clothes from second-hand stores have a special smell. As you get older, you notice smells less. Some people start smoking. Others just get used to how things are. The smell of old books on an unused piano becomes normal. Even after washing, the smell stays in things made of leather.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk to them all. There are also two places that sell used things to help people in need, a library, a store with rare books, and a shop with interesting old things. Many cars and people fill the streets every morning in the center of town. But inside these stores, it is very quiet. It is nice to spend time there.\n\nMore people come to our city every year. They say our city is growing. A big company that sells things on the internet has its main office here. This reminds me of New York City. Everyone follows their own path, and no one asks too many questions. You can be by yourself, and people will let you be. It is not like the southern part of our country, where asking about others shows you care.\n\nI live near people who play piano and sing. We have become friends instead of just people who live near each other. We help each other, share happy times, and support each other when sad things happen. I am lucky to be here. My neighbors are kind, and I try to be kind too. We share food and help with mail. Even though I live in a big city that can feel cold, my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town near a big city in the middle of America. My part of town, on the east side, is where many people with less money live. Houses here do not cost much, and most people rent them. Still, it is a nice place. People who live near me are friendly and say hello when I walk by.\n\nWhile crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, it is still mostly safe. There have been some bad events near my home in the past ten years, including some shootings. Our neighbors lost their son last year when he was shot near a local bar. My family has been lucky, though we sometimes lose small things from our front steps if we forget to bring them inside.\n\nLike many places in America, our town has problems with dangerous drugs. Many people have died from taking bad medicine. However, there are places here that help people who want to stop using drugs. They also teach families how to help loved ones who might take too much.\n\nEven with these problems, there are many good things about my town. My son goes to a very good school. The teachers and other workers there are wonderful. Even though my son has special needs, other children are kind to him, and he is very happy there. Parents and teachers work together to make the school better. Because many families here do not have much money, all children get free food at school. No one is treated badly because they cannot pay, and school activities do not cost much.\n\nThe town leaders have made many things look better. They fixed roads and made parks nicer. But most of these changes happened in the middle of town and on the west side, where the stores are. The east side, where I live, often gets left out. This makes people in my area unhappy.\n\nStill, I like living here. People are nice, the schools are good, and we have enough stores to buy what we need. Our house may not be worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for more than 16 years, and we want to stay here.",
            "I live in a special part of town called Hilltop. It sits on high ground, with many old buildings around it. My home is in a tall building across from a theater. Down the street, there is a place where people play games and drink. Many people come there when the weather is warm.\n\nNear my home is a city park. It is big, with concrete walls and steps around it. In winter, people who have no homes put their tents on the steps and near the sidewalk. It does not snow much here, but it rains a lot. These people stay close to each other to keep warm. They can also walk to a place where they can wash.\n\nWhat makes this area special is not just the old buildings or how it looks. It is the people who live here. Years ago, Hilltop was known as a dangerous place. The government tried to make it safer. People still tell stories about those times.\n\nToday, people work hard to keep the area clean and safe. Some say white people should not walk here at night. I think this idea comes from old fears. Maybe because my skin is not fully white, or maybe because I am now part of this community, I feel safe here.\n\nThis place shows that our country still has problems with how people think about each other. But Hilltop is my home. People here are kind. Once, when I needed help, the person at the laundry place let me stay late to charge my phone. Another time, when I was sitting alone in the rain, someone gave me money and told me I matter.\n\nNo matter where I go, Hilltop will always be my home.",
            "I came to live in this area when I was ready to start my last year of middle school. At first, it was not easy to find friends, but I became close with two boys who lived on my street. They have moved away now, but I still remember our time together. Most people who lived here when I first came still live here today.\n\nMy area looks like many other places where Americans live outside big cities. There are many houses with two floors. When the weather is warm, I can hear children playing outside. Most days are quiet here. I have never had trouble with anyone who lives nearby. People here leave you alone unless you need help. When I get things sent to my house, no one takes them. I feel safe with my neighbors.\n\nThere is a small park very close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played many games there with other boys, like basketball and football. Once, I got hurt playing football there, but most memories are good. Now, I go there with my young cousins. They love to play on the swings and slides. They get very happy when we talk about going to the park. When I go there now, it makes me think about old times.\n\nMany different kinds of people live here. You can find food from many places nearby. Within a short walk, you can get Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. Many people now use their phones to have food brought to them. There are also many places that sell quick food and pizza.\n\nYou can find all the stores you need here. There are places to clean clothes, drug stores, and a big food store. There is even a store that sells Indian food and things to make Indian meals at home.\n\nI really like living in this area. When I read about problems other people have where they live, I am very happy with my neighborhood.",
            "I live near my college, which makes me happy. The area has many apartment buildings and some places to eat and drink that do not cost too much. There is one bar with a new name that costs more, but it is still okay to visit. Most people who live here are nice. Many are students or people who do not have much money, as the apartments are not expensive. There are many children around because there is a school close by.\n\nI do not know the people who live next to me, and that is fine. They smoke a lot, so the building owners put something in the hall to make the air smell better. My friend and I think this is funny. Most buildings here are old on the outside but some look better inside. There are new apartments down the street, but they were not built well. They cost a lot because they are near school.\n\nThere is a very cheap eating place near me where they serve food on paper plates. Next to it is a gas station. The city fixed the street last summer, adding new walking paths and grass, which made things look better. Many trees grow around my building, though some were cut down. Behind my building are more trees and more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. The street behind mine, 43rd Street, does not look as nice. The walking paths there are broken, and the buildings do not look good. The trees there help hide how the buildings look. Bad things sometimes happen in that area, and also across from where I live.\n\nStill, I like living here. I can pay for it, and everything I need is close. I like that I can walk to school, and I can take a bus to the store or to the center of town.",
            "I live in a special group of houses. Each house is actually two homes put together, but they look like single homes. They all have yellow walls, white front areas, and green metal tops. Most people who live here are friends. In the evening, we often meet and talk while children play with their toys or draw with chalk on the ground. Sometimes they fly kites, too.\n\nLiving here feels like going back to an earlier time, away from today's world of computers. We have fields and trees all around us, with blue sky and white clouds above. The only bad thing is that we sometimes get warnings about strong storms. Last night, we heard loud warning sounds telling us to find safe places to hide.\n\nI went to my bathroom with my small dog, some soft things to sit on, and my bag. My big dog stayed in the living room, making loud sounds because he was afraid. Outside, ice fell from the sky, and then the road made steam because the weather got much cooler very fast. When the storm ended, the sun came out while it was still raining, and two beautiful colored lines appeared in the sky. I took pictures to show my friends.\n\nAfter an hour, people came back outside. Mothers watched their children play while food was cooking. I moved here from the north, and I like how people talk here in the south. My home has two rooms for sleeping and two rooms for washing. All homes look the same outside, but they are different inside.\n\nI enjoy walking in the big field behind my house. There is a small lake there, but we cannot swim in it. I see deer sometimes, and in the morning, I hear big frogs making sounds. I live forty minutes away from the big city. Every morning, I hear farm birds making their morning sounds. There is even a special animal like a horse that makes loud sounds in the evening. I am very happy I found this nice place to live.",
            "I have lived in this area for ten years and would like to share my story. When we first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I felt very sad. I cried because I missed my old friends. However, my parents wanted better things for me and my little sister. They chose this area because it had better houses and a good high school.\n\nOver time, I made new friends at school. I did not know many people who lived near us, except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, who live next door. They became like family to us. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was a very happy day. At the wedding, I caught the small white band that Ms. Veda threw from her leg. We danced and had fun with their daughter Marsharii, though I have not seen her since then.\n\nOur area is like a maze, but now I use a map system to find my way. I often spent time with my friends Kason and Curtis playing games. I also like going to the park. Being in nature makes me feel calm and peaceful. I practice keeping my balance with sticks I bought from the store. Sometimes I bring my wooden practice sword.\n\nThe park has places to play basketball and tennis. While I have not played these sports lately, it is good to know they are there. My father taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many good memories here. I believe even better times are coming in the future.",
            "I live in Johnston, a small town in South Carolina. While it may look like many other towns, it is special because of its peaches. In fact, our town calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, and we show this proudly on our welcome sign.\n\nMost of our land is used for growing peaches or raising cows. Houses outside the town center sit far apart from each other. Many have two floors with metal or gray tops to help stay cool in the hot summer. These homes often sit far from the road, with fields in front for animals or growing food.\n\nIn the middle of town, we have one traffic light where four roads meet. This is where you find our few stores. We have three places to eat: a Chinese family restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican place called Fiesta, and a burger shop called Gary's.\n\nWe have a small drug store called Maxwell and Halford, known for its special cola drinks. Our only food store is IGA, but it is expensive. Many people drive to the bigger town of Batesburg-Leesville to shop at Walmart. The busiest store in town is Dollar General, which sells many everyday things.\n\nThere is a furniture store called Possibilities, run by a friendly woman everyone knows. Next door is Clark's, where people can take their pets for cleaning and care. We have one doctor's office and one animal doctor's office, both small but good at helping our town's people.\n\nJohnston has one school for young children. Older students must go to school in another town. We do not have a park yet, but the town is building one that will be quite big. We hope this will give families more things to do and bring new people to our town.\n\nWhile we do not have movies, games, or many restaurants, Johnston is still a nice place. It is so small that you might miss it if you drive through too fast!",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is on a street that connects two big roads. Many cars pass by our house each day. Still, it is mostly quiet here. People stay in their homes for many years, so we know most of our neighbors well.\n\nPeople here spend time working in their yards. In winter, children ride sleds down a nearby hill. Our house sits at the front of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. We know which cars belong here, and we notice when we see new ones.\n\nSome people walk for exercise or with their dogs. Children ride bikes in the street. My family stays home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us - my wife, our two daughters who are eleven and fourteen, and me. We play outside often, even when it rains.\n\nSometimes we cook food outside on our back deck. The smell of cooking food is very nice. From spring to fall, someone is always cutting grass. You can hear lawn mowers almost every day until the cold comes.\n\nWe have many trees in our area. This gives us nice shade, but it also means many leaves fall in autumn. We must clean up these leaves and burn them each year. I like how burning leaves smell. It tells us autumn is here. Recently, winters have been warm, so it feels like autumn lasts longer.\n\nOur car space is behind our house, so we rarely use the front door. When I work on my truck in the car space, I can see and hear what happens in our area. During special days like Thanksgiving and Christmas, it is quiet except for visiting cars. Many families have guests, so more cars park on our street.\n\nI am happy living here. If fewer cars used our street as a way to other places, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the high desert where there is mostly brown dirt everywhere you look. Green grass is rare here because water costs too much. When I moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Today, there are more houses, but they are still spread out. Our area is growing into a bigger town, like many other places.\n\nMost people here are friendly. Like all towns, some areas are better than others. I live among nice older people in a good area. We have regular stores that you find in many places, but no expensive shops. To find special stores, we must drive far.\n\nMany people here work building houses and buildings. This is because our town still has much empty land to build on. This worries me because I like our town as it is now. I moved away from a big city and want to stay in a smaller place. I work in building too, putting up walls and ceilings.\n\nWhat I really like here are the animals. The desert is beautiful in its own way. Many special animals and plants live here, and we must protect them. People who live here should learn about these desert animals to live safely with them. My three children love the desert animals, especially the lizards and insects. They often try to catch them to look at them.\n\nOur town, Victorville, has some interesting places to visit. The San Bernardino County Fair comes every year and is fun for families. Near us is Wrightwood, where people can see snow and learn winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum shows interesting things from our area's past, including rocks, old bones, Native American items, and things that tell how our town grew.",
            "My neighborhood is different from what most people might describe. I live on a college campus, and my main community is the people in my dormitory building. The larger campus area is also part of what I think of as my neighborhood.\n\nEven though this is not a usual neighborhood, it has many of the same things you would find in other places. There are places to live, people, shops, and a park.\n\nThere are three different kinds of places where people live here. First, there are apartment buildings. In these, two to four people share one room, and there are four to six rooms on each floor. Most apartment buildings have two floors, so about twenty people live in each one. Second, there are regular houses that people who work at or graduated from the school can rent. These houses usually have two to four bedrooms, but there are not many of them. Third, there are the dormitory buildings, which are the most common. In these buildings, hundreds of students live, usually with two people sharing one room.\n\nThe people who live here come from many different places and cultures. The school workers usually live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory buildings, while older students often live in the apartments.\n\nOur neighborhood has many stores and a park. You can find places to eat, buy clothes, and get food from grocery stores. Everything we need is right here in our neighborhood. The park is a place where everyone can spend time outside. All of us who live here help keep it clean and safe.",
            "I live in a place with few walking paths. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. Many people who exercise like to run up this hill. Since there are no walking paths, people must walk on the road. The road has holes and can be dangerous to drive on.\n\nThe power lines above look old and broken. It rains a lot here, and falling tree parts often break the power lines. Workers must fix them often, making them look strange.\n\nThere are many tall green trees here. But people do not like these trees because they block the view of the water. That is why houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows on their second floors to see the water below. When the sun goes down, the water looks bright and the sky turns orange. Most days are gray and wet, though. Green plant growth covers everything: house tops, cars, and metal bars. Once, I left my car outside for a month. When I came back, it was green all over. It took three hours to clean.\n\nNot many young people live here, even though there is a school nearby. Most people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Instead of children, people have dogs. You often see dogs in yards or running in the street. Sometimes they even come into houses if doors are left open. I found one in my living room once and had to make it leave.\n\nThere are many wild rabbits here. They are big, and people who grow plants do not like them because they dig holes in the ground. My cats hunt these rabbits. We also have many birds: small ones, tiny fast ones that drink flower water, and big hunting birds that sometimes fly by until black birds chase them away.\n\nThere are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the water, you can find places to eat fresh fish. There is not much sand by the water, but you can throw rocks into it. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side even when the air is not clear.",
            "Bensonhurst is a part of Brooklyn that is easy to find. You can get there using public transportation, which many people in New York City use. The area feels like a city neighborhood.\n\nToday, many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. In the past twenty years, more Asian families have moved here. You will see many Asian-owned stores on every street. There are many food stores and places to wash clothes. Local people like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and the stores are close to their homes. Near my house, there are four Asian food stores that I can walk to in two minutes.\n\nThe area has people from many different places. Many families came from other countries, and their children were born here. While many businesses are owned by Asian people, the neighborhood has other people too.\n\nThere is a nice park nearby that was fixed up recently. It has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, places to play handball, and a playground for children. In summer, children can play in the water. People from different backgrounds play together here.\n\nMost people live in two-family houses. There are some tall buildings where people can buy or rent homes. The people are friendly, but it can be loud. Cars often play loud music, and some drivers make noise with their cars early in the morning.\n\nAt night, you should be careful. While the area is mostly safe, some people might cause problems. There are bullies and people who steal. Someone once hurt me here years ago. Today, people sometimes steal packages left outside homes.\n\nOne problem is that some people do not clean up after their dogs. Even though there is a fine in New York City for this, you will see dog waste on the streets when you walk to the train or store. This makes walking around unpleasant, so watch where you step!",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special city with its own way of being different. On a building that serves food, drinks, and music, you can see the words \"Keep Portland Different.\" Some people want to remember how the city was twenty years ago when fewer people lived here and life cost less money. Others see it as a welcome sign to come and be different.\n\nMany people from California have moved here, and new buildings keep going up. Still, Portland stays different. The city accepts things that other places might not. We have normal things too, like stores and businesses. People do yoga, work in offices, and shop like everyone else. Maybe we just worry less about being normal.\n\nIn my area, houses are painted in bright colors. People grow flowers and food in their front yards. In summer, we put boxes on the street with free things inside. These boxes often have clothes and books, but sometimes you find special things you did not expect. Walking through these streets makes Portland special to me.\n\nOther people enjoy Portland in their own ways. Some go to special exercise classes with small farm animals. Others watch our city's soccer team play. Portland has many people who try to make their dreams come true. Some work hard at this, while others talk about it while drinking with friends.\n\nPortland has problems too. Some people use drugs, perhaps because our weather is often dark and rainy. We also have many people without homes. The city tries to help them more than other places do, but it is not enough. Some people want to help those without homes, while others do not. In this way, Portland is like any other city.",
            "The mountains stand in the north. They watch the sun rise and set each day. Even when I am too busy with work to notice them, they remain strong and steady. On hard days when my mind is troubled, the mountains catch my eye. Looking at them helps calm my worried thoughts and gives me strength to continue.\n\nI came here as a student. The mountains near the school were the first thing that caught my attention. The school itself is beautiful, with nice buildings and small lakes with trees. But the mountains are what I love most.\n\nThe town is lovely too. There are many coffee shops where I spent long hours studying. A short bus ride takes you to the old part of town, where old brick buildings hold restaurants and offices. This area feels as busy as a big city. But walk past the library, and you find quiet streets again. Having both busy and quiet areas so close makes this town special, like it wants people to explore it.\n\nI have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends by the old park swings after staying up all night. I remember running to catch movies at the nice theater downtown. But there are sad memories too. I often sat by the small lakes late at night, thinking about life while watching turtles and ducks in the water. I would wonder about my place in the world when things seemed hard to understand.\n\nSometimes I would walk past the lakes, through the quiet streets with small houses, until I reached a main road. One morning, as the sun came up and lit the palm trees, I looked north. There they were, as always - the strong mountains touching the morning sky. Without words, they reminded me to keep going.",
            "At first, you might not notice this special place. It sits behind some stores, where most people would not expect to find homes. But if you walk past the empty food store and the hotels that are mostly quiet except in summer, you will find many people living there.\n\nOn these streets, there are several apartment buildings. They stand next to each other like toys in a row. The first building you see has had some problems, so we will not talk about it much. The other buildings next to it are different and special. Most people who live in this area do not know about them.\n\nAcross the street, there is a small college. Every morning at seven, tired students come with their coffee. They enter through big metal gates while people in cars wait, sometimes not very happily.\n\nThe street meets another road where there is a park on one side and a medical center on the other. The medical center has chairs on its front porch and a fan that moves slowly in the warm air. At the park, children play in the grass while bees fly around the flowers. Older people walk their dogs on the paths. They do not like the young people on skateboards but they smile at the girls who talk about boys near the play area.\n\nNext to the park, there are some small stores. You can find a place that serves fish and rice, a store that sells things for swimming pools, and a place where people get their nails done. There is also a store where you can make your own frozen ice cream. Young people often get ice cream there and then go back to the park with their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is like many other American places. It is in the quiet south where things stay the same for a long time.",
            "I want to tell you about where I live. The houses in my area are mostly for one family, though some are split for two families to live in. My house has a small green space in front and a place for cars on the left side. These houses make me think about how people once wanted to live away from the city. Many people still live this way, but it is not as popular as before.\n\nThe people who live here try to keep their houses nice, but it is not easy. Every house has cars parked outside. Children play in the streets as if nothing else matters. The school has been here for many years. It gives young people hope and makes older people remember good times. The churches do not have many people now, but many young people still play basketball.\n\nAll houses look different but feel like home. There is a big food store run by a family from Yemen. Most people who live here are African American. The streets are wide, and children play games, moving only when cars need to pass. Many families have lived here for many years. They tell stories about times when everyone knew their neighbors.\n\nWe once had a place that taught fighting sports, but now it is a drug store. We have a small movie house that shows old films for less money. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it.\n\nA big road passes near our town, but you cannot get on it here. Young people wanted a way to get on the big road from our town, but older people said no. They thought it would hurt our town. We are building a new school now. We need to pick something to represent our town. I think it should be something that shows both old and new ways of life.",
            "I live in a big city where many different kinds of people live close to each other. My area has homes mixed with places where people work and shop. There are many offices, stores, restaurants, and places where people go to have fun.\n\nThere are always new places to eat and shop. Some stores are part of big companies that everyone knows. There are also many small stores owned by local people. These stores are in shopping centers and along the streets near quiet living areas.\n\nThere are parks nearby where families bring their children to play. Many different groups of people live here. We have gay and lesbian people, Jewish people who follow old ways, and people who came from Russia and nearby countries. If you go a little further, you can find areas where Chinese, Korean, and Armenian people live together.\n\nGetting around the city is hard. A ten-mile trip can take two hours when there are many cars on the road. Most people drive cars instead of walking, even to close places. This makes it hard to find places to park, and the roads are always full.\n\nThey are building many new tall houses for people to live in. Some people who already live here are not happy about more people moving in because it means more cars on the roads. We have many kinds of homes here - big houses, small houses, and middle-sized houses where more than one family lives.\n\nPeople of all ages live in my area, but I do not know many of my neighbors well. When I was young, I used to play outside with the children who lived next door, but now people do not spend as much time with their neighbors.",
            "\"What do you see here?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields that went as far as we could see. \"This is all there is!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by how empty it looked. She came from a place where stores were close to her home. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nAs we drove, I told her about growing up in Ohio's farming area. This helped her understand who I am. If you follow the small road, you will find a water-filled hole in the ground. My house is just past it, in a group of homes. The houses are made of brick and have large yards that people keep very nice. In spring, there are many flowers and trees that change with each season.\n\nNice cars sit in the driveways, clean and bright in the sun. Near my grey house lives a man from Korea. He spends much time cutting his grass and singing. People smile when they see him. He used to be a doctor and is now older. He rides his grass-cutting machine all day.\n\nAt my house, birds walk in the yard while our small dog runs after them. Behind the house, there is a small stream of water. You can hear frogs and sometimes cows from nearby farms. Past a wooden bridge I made, there is a beautiful area with trees, plants, and wild flowers. I spent much of my young life there. I built places in trees and played with friends who lived nearby.\n\nThe cold time of year can be hard, but it is very beautiful. The green yard becomes white. Trees that had bright flowers become empty. When snow falls, it makes everything look special. My younger sister made snow shapes on the ground and snow people. As children, we often played in the snow, throwing snow balls at each other. We built snow houses with branches to hide behind. In our own special place, we played without worry. We were just children having fun."
