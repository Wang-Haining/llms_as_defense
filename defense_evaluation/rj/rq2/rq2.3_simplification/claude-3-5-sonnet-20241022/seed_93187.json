            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan. Our area has farms and small places where visitors come. We do not have big stores or many restaurants. We must drive to get anywhere we need to go.\n\nStill, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town sits between two large lakes - Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find places to put your feet in the water everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood shows what small-town life is like. The houses are not close together. Each house looks different from the others. Many are old houses, and some people are making them look newer. Most houses have rooms under the ground that you can see from the street. The houses have different colors, and most have yards where children can play. Some people grow plants for food, and others have places for their animals.\n\nThe people who live here work hard and raise their families. You can see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs and ride their bikes. Neighbors know each other, and we can tell who lives here and who does not. People cooking food outside will wave to you, and those walking their dogs will smile.\n\nEveryone takes good care of their yards. The grass is always cut, and the plants are kept neat. When you drive through our neighborhood, you might think it would be a good place to raise children. It is quiet and safe.\n\nNear us, we have important buildings like the police station and health office. We have places to play baseball, and a small airport where planes take off and land. Children can walk to get ice cream or ride their bikes to the park. We can even walk to the center of town.\n\nThis is a very good place to live.",
            "I live in an area that looks like many other places where people live outside big cities. My neighborhood has many rules because a group of homeowners controls how things look. When you come in, you see many houses that look the same. Each house has a small green area in front with rocks and small trees. Every house has space for two cars.\n\nThe roads are very good because they are new and well-kept. Most houses are one floor high, but some have two floors. We do not have mail boxes in front of our houses. Instead, we have many mail boxes together at the end of the street. Everyone has a key to get their mail. There are also two bigger boxes for larger items.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city, where the city meets the country. We have a lot of space here. There are several swimming pools that people who live here can use. The pools have gates and are kept clean. There are also paths where people can walk their dogs or take walks. You do not need to go to a park to exercise because our neighborhood is big enough to run in.\n\nMost people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Some younger working people live here too. It is very safe, and people watch out for each other. Our city is big when you count the people, but it feels small. We have most things people need. We have one shopping center. It is not very big, but it works well for us.\n\nIt takes about fifteen minutes by car to get to stores. We have many different kinds of stores. Some sell healthy food that costs more, and others sell fewer things for less money. My neighborhood is safe and well-kept. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. While stores are not very close, you can drive to any store you want.",
            "I first learned about my home while listening to a radio show about missing people. This was unexpected. Most homes in this area cost more than one thousand dollars each month to live in. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Perhaps it shows how hard life can be. Some of my friends cry at night because things cost so much money. We have learned to live with less over time.\n\nYou get used to buying old things from markets. The smell of old clothes and toys becomes normal. As you grow up, you notice smells less. Some people start smoking. Others just get used to how things are. But the market smell is always there. Growing up means having old books on an unused piano. The smell stays in everything, even after washing.\n\nThere are three used-goods stores near my home. You can walk to two charity stores, a library, a special book store, and a shop with unusual things. Many cars and people fill the streets every morning, but the stores are quiet inside. It is peaceful to spend time there. Each year, more people come to our city. A big computer shopping company has its main office here. The city is still growing, like New York. Everyone follows their own path, and no one asks much of you. You can be by yourself, and people will not bother you. It is different from the South, where people show they care by asking questions. Here, you can keep to yourself.\n\nThe city is full of life. My neighbor plays piano, and two people above me sing. We are not just people living near each other - we are friends. We help each other, share happy and sad times, and care for one another. I am happy to be here. My neighbors are good people, and we are kind to each other. We share food and help with mail. Even though I live in a big, cold city, my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town near a big city in the middle part of America. My neighborhood is on the east side of town, where many people do not have much money. Most houses here are not expensive, and many people rent their homes. Still, it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when they see me.\n\nWhile crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, it is still mostly safe. There have been some bad events near my home in the past ten years, including some shootings. Our neighbors lost their son last year when he was shot near a local bar. My family has been lucky, with only small things sometimes being taken from our front area when we forget to bring them inside.\n\nLike many places in America, our town has problems with dangerous drugs. Many people have died from taking these drugs. However, there are places in town that help people who have drug problems, and there are classes to teach people how to help someone who has taken too many drugs.\n\nEven with these problems, there are many good things about our town. My son goes to a very good school with wonderful teachers and leaders. Even though he has special needs, other children are kind to him, and he is very happy there. Parents and teachers work together to make the school better. Because many families in town do not have much money, all children get free food at school. No one is treated badly because they cannot pay, and school activities do not cost much money.\n\nThe town leaders have made the town look better by fixing roads and parks. However, most of this work has been done in the middle and west parts of town, where most stores are. The east side, where I live, often does not get these improvements. This makes people in my area unhappy.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are enough stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable and good enough for us. We have lived here for more than 16 years, and we want to stay here.",
            "I live in a special part of town called Hilltop. It sits on top of a hill, with many old buildings around it. My home is in a tall building across from a theater. Down the street, there is a place where people play games and drink. In summer, many people wait in line to go inside.\n\nNear my home is a city park. The park is big and has many concrete steps around it. In winter, people without homes put their tents on these steps. It does not snow much here, but it rains a lot. These people stay close together to keep warm. They can walk to a place where they can wash and get help.\n\nWhat makes this place special is not just the old buildings or the way they look. It is the people who live here. Years ago, this area was known for having problems with groups who did bad things. The government tried to stop these problems. People still tell stories about those times.\n\nToday, people work hard to make our area better. Some say white people should not walk here at night. I think this idea comes from old fears. Maybe it is because my skin is a darker color, or maybe because people here know me, but I feel safe. This place shows how people still have wrong ideas about others who look different from them.\n\nNo matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. People here are kind. Once, when I needed to charge my phone, a shop owner let me stay late. When I had nowhere to go in the rain, people helped me. One time, when I was sitting alone on the street, someone gave me money and told me I was worth something. These are the things that make Hilltop special to me.",
            "I came to live in this area when I was thirteen years old. At first, it was not easy to find friends, but I became close with two boys who lived on my street. They have moved away now, but I still remember our time together. Most of the same people who lived here when I first came still live here today.\n\nMy area looks like many other places where Americans live outside big cities. There are many houses with two floors. When the weather is warm, I can hear children playing outside. Most days are quiet here. I have never had trouble with anyone who lives nearby. People here leave you alone unless you need help. When I get things sent to my house, no one takes them. I feel safe with my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park very close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played many games there with other boys from the area. Once, I got hurt playing football, but most of my memories are happy ones. Now, I take my young cousins to the park. They love the swings and slides. When I tell them we are going to the park, they get very happy. The park makes me think of many good times from my past.\n\nMany different kinds of people live here. You can find food from many countries nearby. Within a short walk, you can get Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. Many people now use their phones to have food brought to their homes. There are also many places that sell fast food and pizza.\n\nYou can find everything you need in the stores here. There are places to clean clothes, drug stores, and a big food store that many people in this part of the country know well. There is even a store owned by Indian people where you can buy Indian food to cook or eat right away.\n\nI really like living in this area. When I read about problems other people have with their neighbors, I feel very lucky to live here.",
            "I live near my college, which makes me happy. My area has many apartment buildings and some places to eat and drink. These places do not cost too much money. One drinking place got a new name and costs more now, but it is still okay.\n\nThe people who live here are nice. Many are students or people who do not have much money, as the apartments are not expensive. There are many children here because a school is close by. I do not know the people who live next to me, and that is fine. They smoke a lot, so the building owners put something in the hall to make it smell better. My friend and I think this is funny.\n\nMost buildings here are old, but some are fixed up inside. New apartments were built down the street, but they were not built well. They cost too much money because they are close to school.\n\nThere is a very cheap eating place near me. They use paper plates and heat most food in a small cooking box. Next to it is a place to buy gas for cars. The city fixed the street last summer, adding new walking paths and grass, which made everything look better.\n\nMany trees grow around my building. Some were cut down, but we still have more trees than other places nearby. Behind my building are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and 43rd Street is behind us. That street does not look as nice. The walking paths are broken, and the buildings look old. The trees there help hide how the buildings look. Bad things sometimes happen in that area, and also across from where I live.\n\nStill, I like living here. I can pay for it, and everything I need is close. I like that I can walk to school, and I can take a bus to buy food or go to the city center.",
            "I live in a special group of connected houses. Each house joins with another, but they are built to look separate. All the houses are yellow with white front areas and green metal tops. Most people here are friends. In the evening, we often meet at the end of our roads to talk while children play with their toys or draw with chalk. Sometimes they fly kites. It feels like going back to an older time, away from today's world of computers.\n\nTrees and fields are all around us, with blue sky and white clouds above. The only bad thing is the dangerous storms we get. Last night, we heard warning sounds for a big wind storm. I had to hide in my bathroom with my small dog and some soft things to stay safe. My big dog stayed in the living room, making noise because he was afraid.\n\nThe storm brought ice balls that fell on the ground. After the storm, steam came from the road because the weather changed quickly. The temperature went from very hot to cool in just minutes. When the sun came out while it was still raining, two rainbows appeared in the sky. I took pictures to show my friends.\n\nI moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like how people talk with their southern way of speaking. My home has two rooms and two bathrooms. Even though all houses look the same outside, they are different inside. Some are very small.\n\nI enjoy walking in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there, but we cannot swim in it. I see deer sometimes, and in the morning, I hear big frogs making noise. I live forty minutes from the big city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. We even hear a donkey making noise in the evening from a close farm. I am very happy I found this nice place to live.",
            "I have lived in this area for ten years and would like to share my story. When we first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was very sad. I cried because I missed my old friends. However, my parents wanted better things for me and my younger sister. They chose this area because it had better houses and schools.\n\nOver time, I made new friends at school. I did not know many people who lived near us, except for Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, who live next door. They became like family to us. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister. It was a very happy day. At the wedding, I caught the small white band that Ms. Veda threw from her leg. We danced and had fun with their daughter Marsharii, though I have not seen her since then.\n\nOur area is like a maze, but now I use a map system to find my way. I often spent time with my friends Kason and Curtis playing games. I also like going to the park to enjoy nature, which helps me feel calm. I practice keeping my balance with sticks I bought from the store. The park has places to play basketball and tennis. When I was younger, my father taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many good memories here, and I believe more good times are coming.",
            "I live in a small town called Johnston in South Carolina. Our town is special because we grow many peaches. In fact, we call ourselves the Peach Capital of the World, and this is written on our welcome sign.\n\nMost of our land is used for growing peaches or raising cows. Houses outside the town center are far apart. These homes usually have two floors with metal or gray tops to help stay cool in the hot summer. Many houses sit far from the road, with fields in front for animals or growing food.\n\nIn the middle of town, we have one traffic light where four roads meet. This is where all our stores are. We have three places to eat: a Chinese family restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican place called Fiesta, and a burger place called Gary's. We also have a small drug store famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, and one food store called IGA. Many people drive to the bigger town of Batesburg-Leesville to shop at Walmart because IGA is expensive.\n\nOur busiest store is Dollar General, which sells many everyday things. We have a furniture store run by a nice woman who will send workers to bring furniture to your home. Next door is a place where people can take their pets for cleaning and care.\n\nWe have one doctor's office and one animal doctor's office. Both are small but take good care of our people and pets. Children go to Johnston Elementary School, but older students must go to school in another town.\n\nRight now, our town is building a new area for families to play and spend time outside. We don't have many places for fun like movie theaters or places to play. But even though our town is small - so small you might miss it when driving by - it is a nice place to live.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that joins two main roads, so many cars pass by each day. Still, it is mostly quiet here. Most people stay in their homes for many years, so we know our neighbors well.\n\nPeople here work in their yards and do daily tasks. In winter, children slide down a hill on our side street. Our house sits at the front of the street, letting us see who comes and goes. We know which cars belong here, so we notice when strange cars appear.\n\nSome neighbors walk for health or with their dogs. Children ride bikes in the street. My family stays home much of the time because we work here. There are four of us - my wife, two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen), and me. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we cook food on our back deck, which makes the air smell good.\n\nFrom spring to fall, someone is always cutting grass. We have many trees that give good shade, but they drop many leaves in fall. We must clean up these leaves and burn them. I like how burning leaves smell. The winters have been warm lately, making it feel like a long fall.\n\nOur garage is behind our house, so we rarely use the front door. I fix my truck and work on things in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nDuring holidays, it is very quiet here. At Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Mother's Day, families have visitors and many cars park on our street. I am happy living here. If fewer cars used our street as a way through, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the high desert. Here, there is mostly brown dirt everywhere you look. People who have not lived here may not understand what it is like to see brown all the time. When you see green grass, you know someone is paying a lot of money to keep it that way.\n\nI first came here in the 1990s. Back then, houses were far apart. It is still like that today, but there are more houses now. This place grows more like a city each day, as many places do. Most people here are friendly, but like all cities, there are good and bad areas. In my part of town, I live near nice older people.\n\nThe stores here are mostly big chain stores. We do not have expensive stores nearby. You must travel far to find those. Many people here work in building houses and buildings. This is because our city still has much empty space to build on. This worries me because I like how things are now. I left a big city and do not want to live in one again. I work in building too, putting up walls inside houses.\n\nWhat I like most are the animals here. Many people come to the high desert to see its simple beauty. The weather and land here make it special for plants and animals. People who live here should learn about these animals to live safely with them. My family likes the wildlife very much. My three children love looking for lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch some.\n\nWe have some interesting places to visit. The San Bernardino County Fair comes every year. Near us is Wrightwood, where you can see snow on mountains and learn winter sports. If you want to learn about desert history, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has old rocks, bones, Native American items, and things that show how our city grew over time.",
            "My neighborhood is different from what most people might describe. I live on a college campus, and my community is made up of the students who live in the same buildings. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood.\n\nEven though my neighborhood is special, it is like other neighborhoods in many ways. It has places to live, people, stores, and a park. Let me tell you about the different places where people live here.\n\nThere are three kinds of homes in my area. First, there are apartment buildings where two to four people share one room. Each building usually has two floors with four to six rooms on each floor. About twenty people live in each apartment building.\n\nSecond, there are regular houses that people who work at or graduated from the school can rent. These houses usually have two to four bedrooms, but there are not many of them.\n\nThird, there are the big dormitory buildings where hundreds of students live. Most rooms in these buildings are shared by two students. This is the most common type of housing here.\n\nThe people who live in my neighborhood come from many different places and cultures. The teachers and workers usually live in the houses. New students live in the dormitories, while older students often live in the apartments.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores and a park. Because the school is like its own small town, we can find everything we need here. There are places to eat, shops that sell school clothes, and stores that sell food. The park is a place where everyone can spend time outside. All of us who live here help keep it clean and safe.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. People who exercise like to run up this hill. Because there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes, making it hard to drive on.\n\nPower lines run all around our area. They often look broken because strong rain and wind cause tree branches to fall on them. Many tall green trees grow here, but people do not like them. They cut down trees because the trees block the view of the water.\n\nThe houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows on their upper floors to see the water. When the sun goes down, the water looks beautiful and bright, and the sky turns orange. Most days are gray and wet. Green plant growth covers many things like house tops and cars. One time, I left my car outside for many days, and it turned green. It took me a long time to clean it.\n\nNot many young people live here, even though there is a school nearby. Most people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Many people have dogs instead of children. The dogs often run in yards or on the street. Sometimes they even come into houses if doors are left open.\n\nThere are many rabbits here. They dig holes in people's yards and hurt the plants. My cats catch many of them. We also see many birds: small ones, very tiny fast ones, and big hunting birds. The black birds chase away the big hunting birds.\n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you walk down to the water, you can eat at places that serve fish. There is not much sand by the water, but you can throw rocks into it. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side most days, even when it is not clear.",
            "Bensonhurst is an area in Brooklyn, New York City that is easy to find. You can get there using public transportation, which many people in New York City use. The area feels like a city neighborhood.\n\nWhen you visit, you will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You can find Asian-owned stores on almost every street. There are many food stores and places to wash clothes. Local people like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and the stores are close to their homes. Near my home, there are four Asian food stores within a short walk.\n\nThe area has people from many different places. Many people who live here came from other countries, and their children were born in America. While many businesses are owned by Asian people, the area also has a nice park. The park has many places to play basketball, an open field for games, places for handball, and areas for children to play. In summer, children can play in the water. People from different backgrounds play together well in the park.\n\nMost people live in two-family houses, though there are some apartment buildings. The people are friendly but can be loud. Cars often play loud music, and some drivers make noise with their cars early in the morning.\n\nAt night, you should be careful. While the area is mostly safe, some people might cause problems. There have been cases of stealing and fighting. Also, even though there are rules about cleaning up after dogs, some people do not follow them. You might see dog waste on the streets when walking to the train or stores.\n\nDespite these problems, Bensonhurst is still a good place to visit, but remember to watch where you walk to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Let me tell you about Portland, Oregon. People here like to say \"Keep Portland Strange.\" This saying is painted on a building that has many different businesses inside it.\n\nSome people want Portland to stay like it was twenty years ago. Back then, it was less known and cost less to live here. Other people come here because they want to be different, and that is good here.\n\nMany rich people are moving to Portland from California. New buildings are going up everywhere. But Portland is still different from other cities. We have normal things, like stores and offices. We also have special things you might not see elsewhere.\n\nIn my part of the city, the houses are painted in bright colors. People grow flowers and food in their front yards. In summer, we put boxes on the street with free things inside. You might find clothes, books, or other nice things that someone does not want anymore.\n\nSome people here do unusual activities. They do exercises with small goats, or they watch soccer games. Others like to spend time at bars. Like other cities, Portland has problems. Some people do not have homes. Others have problems with drugs. The rain and dark clouds for much of the year make some people feel sad.\n\nThe city tries to help people who need it. We do more than many other cities, but it is still not enough. Some people care a lot about helping others, while some do not. In this way, Portland is like any other city in America.",
            "The mountains stand in the north. They watch the sun rise and set each day. Even when I am too busy with work to notice them, they remain strong and unchanging. On my hardest days, when worry fills my mind, I look to these mountains. They help me find peace and give me strength to continue.\n\nI came here as a student. The mountains near the school caught my attention first. The school itself is beautiful, with nice buildings and small lakes with trees. But the mountains are special to me. \n\nThe town is lovely too. There are many coffee shops where I spent long hours studying. A short bus ride takes you to the old part of town, where old red and brown buildings hold restaurants and offices. This area feels as busy as a big city. But walk past the library, and you find quiet streets again. The mix of busy and quiet areas makes this place special, like it wants you to explore it.\n\nI have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends by the old park swings after staying up all night. I remember running to catch movies at the nice theater downtown. But sad memories live here too. I often sat by the small lakes late at night, thinking about life while watching turtles and ducks swim. I would sometimes cry there, wondering about my place in the world.\n\nOne day, I walked past the lake, through the quiet streets with small houses, until I reached a main road. The sun was rising, making the palm trees glow. I looked up and saw I was walking north. And there they were - the mountains, touching the blue and yellow morning sky. Without words, they reminded me to stay strong and keep going.",
            "At first, you might not see it. Behind the stores is a place where people live. If you walk past the old, empty food store and the hotels that are mostly quiet except in summer, you will find many people living there.\n\nOn these streets, there are several apartment buildings. They stand next to each other in a line, like boxes that get smaller and smaller. The first apartments you see have had some problems, so we will not talk about them much. The other apartment buildings next to it are different and special. Most people who live in this area do not know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. Students come early in the morning with their coffee. They enter through big metal gates while people in cars wait, sometimes becoming angry at the slow traffic.\n\nThe street meets another street where there is a park on one side and a medical center on the other. The medical center has chairs on its front porch and a fan that moves slowly in the hot summer air. At the park, children play and run in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers near the road. Older people walk their dogs on the path. They look unhappy at young people on skateboards but smile at young girls who talk about boys near the play equipment.\n\nNext to the park is a small group of stores. There is a place that serves Japanese food, a store that sells things for swimming pools, and a place where people get their nails done. There is also a store that sells cold sweet treats. Young people often buy these treats and eat them while they play in the park.\n\nThis neighborhood is like many places in the American South. It is quiet and does not change much over time.",
            "I want to tell you about where I live. The houses in my area are mostly for one family. Some houses have been made into two homes that share walls. My house has a small green space in front and a place for cars on the left side.\n\nThe houses here make people think about how life was better in the past. Many people wanted to live in places like this years ago. Now, fewer people want this kind of life. But our area, and many others like it, show that this way of life continues.\n\nPeople here may not feel as happy as before. The small yards may not look as nice. But every house has cars outside, and children still play in the streets. The school has been here for many years. It gives young people hope for tomorrow, while older people remember their school days there.\n\nThere are not many churches now, and few people go to them. But many young people still play basketball. Each house looks different, but they all feel like home. There is a big food store run by a family from Yemen. Most people who live here are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play games here, moving only when cars need to pass. Many families have lived here for many years. They remember when everyone knew their neighbors.\n\nWe used to have a place where children learned fighting sports. Now it is a drug store. We have a small movie house that shows old films for less money. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it.\n\nA big road passes near our town, but you cannot get on it here. Young people wanted a way to get on the big road from our town. Older people said no because they thought it would hurt our town. The older people won.\n\nWe are building a new school for older students. We are trying to pick an animal or thing to represent our town. I think we should choose something that shows both old and new ideas about our town.",
            "I live in a big city where many different kinds of people live together. My area has homes mixed with places where people work and shop. There are many offices, stores, restaurants, and places where people go to have fun. We always have new places to eat and shop. Some stores are part of big companies that everyone knows, but there are also many small stores owned by local people. These stores are in shopping centers and along the streets near quiet living areas.\n\nWe have parks nearby where families bring their children to play. Many different groups of people live in my area. We have gay and lesbian people, Jewish people who follow their old ways, and people who came here from Russia and nearby countries. If you go a little farther in our city, you find areas where people from Korea, China, and Armenia live together.\n\nGetting around the city is hard. A ten-mile trip can take two hours when there are many cars on the road. Most people drive cars instead of walking, even though some places are close by. This makes it hard to find places to park, and the roads are very busy.\n\nIn recent years, workers have built many tall buildings where people can live. While many people want to move here, those who already live here worry about more cars and people coming. We have different kinds of homes in our city. Some people live in big buildings, while others live in single homes or small apartment buildings. Some buildings have two homes in them.\n\nPeople of all ages live in my area, but I do not know many of my neighbors well. When I was young, I played outside with the children who lived next door, but now people do not spend as much time with their neighbors.",
            "\"What do you see here?\" she asked as we drove past endless fields of corn. \"This is all there is!\" I replied. I knew she would be surprised by how empty it looked. She grew up in a town where she could walk to buy food in five minutes. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nAs I showed her the wide fields, I told her about growing up in Ohio's farming area. This helped her understand who I was and where I came from. On the small road, you will find a water-filled hole in the ground. My house is just past it, in a group of homes. The houses are made of brick and have large yards. People here work hard to keep their yards looking nice.\n\nIn spring, many flowers grow next to trees that change with each season. Nice cars sit in every driveway, clean and bright in the sun. Near my gray house, my neighbor from Korea often works in his yard. He cuts grass all day and sings while he works. Everyone smiles when they see him. He used to be a doctor, but now he spends his days on his riding grass cutter.\n\nAt my house, birds walk in the yard while our small dog runs after them. Behind the house, there is a small stream that runs to the water hole. You can hear frogs, running water, and cows from nearby farms. Across a wooden bridge we built, there is an open area with trees, plants, and wild flowers. I spent much of my young life there.\n\nI built houses in trees and chased animals with friends from nearby homes. The cold times are hard, but they are beautiful. The green yard becomes white and empty. Trees that had bright flowers become bare. When snow falls, it makes everything white and pretty. My younger sister made snow shapes on the ground and built snow people. We often threw snow at each other and built snow walls with branches. In our special place, we played and did not worry about anything. We were just children having fun."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan. Our area has farms and small places where visitors come. We do not have big stores or many restaurants. We must drive to get anywhere we need to go.\n\nStill, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town sits between two large lakes - Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find places to put your feet in the water everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood shows what small-town life is like. The houses are not close together. Each house looks different from the others. Many are old houses, and some people are making them look newer. Most houses have rooms under the ground that you can see from the street. The houses have different colors, and most have yards where children can play. Some people grow plants for food, and others have places for their animals.\n\nThe people who live here work hard and raise their families. You can see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs and ride their bikes. Neighbors know each other, and we can tell who lives here and who does not. People cooking food outside will wave to you, and those walking their dogs will smile.\n\nEveryone takes good care of their yards. The grass is always cut, and the plants are kept neat. When you drive through our neighborhood, you might think it would be a good place to raise children. It is quiet and safe.\n\nNear us, we have important buildings like the police station and health office. We have places to play baseball, and a small airport where planes take off and land. Children can walk to get ice cream or ride their bikes to the park. We can even walk to the center of town.\n\nThis is a very good place to live.",
            "I live in an area that looks like many other places where people live outside big cities. My neighborhood has many rules because a group of homeowners controls how things look. When you come in, you see many houses that look the same. Each house has a small green area in front with rocks and small trees. Every house has space for two cars.\n\nThe roads are very good because they are new and well-kept. Most houses are one floor high, but some have two floors. We do not have mail boxes in front of our houses. Instead, we have many mail boxes together at the end of the street. Everyone has a key to get their mail. There are also two bigger boxes for larger items.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city, where the city meets the country. We have a lot of space here. There are several swimming pools that people who live here can use. The pools have gates and are kept clean. There are also paths where people can walk their dogs or take walks. You do not need to go to a park to exercise because our neighborhood is big enough to run in.\n\nMost people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Some younger working people live here too. It is very safe, and people watch out for each other. Our city is big when you count the people, but it feels small. We have most things people need. We have one shopping center. It is not very big, but it works well for us.\n\nIt takes about fifteen minutes by car to get to stores. We have many different kinds of stores. Some sell healthy food that costs more, and others sell fewer things for less money. My neighborhood is safe and well-kept. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. While stores are not very close, you can drive to any store you want.",
            "I first learned about my home while listening to a radio show about missing people. This was unexpected. Most homes in this area cost more than one thousand dollars each month to live in. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Perhaps it shows how hard life can be. Some of my friends cry at night because things cost so much money. We have learned to live with less over time.\n\nYou get used to buying old things from markets. The smell of old clothes and toys becomes normal. As you grow up, you notice smells less. Some people start smoking. Others just get used to how things are. But the market smell is always there. Growing up means having old books on an unused piano. The smell stays in everything, even after washing.\n\nThere are three used-goods stores near my home. You can walk to two charity stores, a library, a special book store, and a shop with unusual things. Many cars and people fill the streets every morning, but the stores are quiet inside. It is peaceful to spend time there. Each year, more people come to our city. A big computer shopping company has its main office here. The city is still growing, like New York. Everyone follows their own path, and no one asks much of you. You can be by yourself, and people will not bother you. It is different from the South, where people show they care by asking questions. Here, you can keep to yourself.\n\nThe city is full of life. My neighbor plays piano, and two people above me sing. We are not just people living near each other - we are friends. We help each other, share happy and sad times, and care for one another. I am happy to be here. My neighbors are good people, and we are kind to each other. We share food and help with mail. Even though I live in a big, cold city, my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town near a big city in the middle part of America. My neighborhood is on the east side of town, where many people do not have much money. Most houses here are not expensive, and many people rent their homes. Still, it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when they see me.\n\nWhile crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, it is still mostly safe. There have been some bad events near my home in the past ten years, including some shootings. Our neighbors lost their son last year when he was shot near a local bar. My family has been lucky, with only small things sometimes being taken from our front area when we forget to bring them inside.\n\nLike many places in America, our town has problems with dangerous drugs. Many people have died from taking these drugs. However, there are places in town that help people who have drug problems, and there are classes to teach people how to help someone who has taken too many drugs.\n\nEven with these problems, there are many good things about our town. My son goes to a very good school with wonderful teachers and leaders. Even though he has special needs, other children are kind to him, and he is very happy there. Parents and teachers work together to make the school better. Because many families in town do not have much money, all children get free food at school. No one is treated badly because they cannot pay, and school activities do not cost much money.\n\nThe town leaders have made the town look better by fixing roads and parks. However, most of this work has been done in the middle and west parts of town, where most stores are. The east side, where I live, often does not get these improvements. This makes people in my area unhappy.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are enough stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable and good enough for us. We have lived here for more than 16 years, and we want to stay here.",
            "I live in a special part of town called Hilltop. It sits on top of a hill, with many old buildings around it. My home is in a tall building across from a theater. Down the street, there is a place where people play games and drink. In summer, many people wait in line to go inside.\n\nNear my home is a city park. The park is big and has many concrete steps around it. In winter, people without homes put their tents on these steps. It does not snow much here, but it rains a lot. These people stay close together to keep warm. They can walk to a place where they can wash and get help.\n\nWhat makes this place special is not just the old buildings or the way they look. It is the people who live here. Years ago, this area was known for having problems with groups who did bad things. The government tried to stop these problems. People still tell stories about those times.\n\nToday, people work hard to make our area better. Some say white people should not walk here at night. I think this idea comes from old fears. Maybe it is because my skin is a darker color, or maybe because people here know me, but I feel safe. This place shows how people still have wrong ideas about others who look different from them.\n\nNo matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. People here are kind. Once, when I needed to charge my phone, a shop owner let me stay late. When I had nowhere to go in the rain, people helped me. One time, when I was sitting alone on the street, someone gave me money and told me I was worth something. These are the things that make Hilltop special to me.",
            "I came to live in this area when I was thirteen years old. At first, it was not easy to find friends, but I became close with two boys who lived on my street. They have moved away now, but I still remember our time together. Most of the same people who lived here when I first came still live here today.\n\nMy area looks like many other places where Americans live outside big cities. There are many houses with two floors. When the weather is warm, I can hear children playing outside. Most days are quiet here. I have never had trouble with anyone who lives nearby. People here leave you alone unless you need help. When I get things sent to my house, no one takes them. I feel safe with my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park very close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played many games there with other boys from the area. Once, I got hurt playing football, but most of my memories are happy ones. Now, I take my young cousins to the park. They love the swings and slides. When I tell them we are going to the park, they get very happy. The park makes me think of many good times from my past.\n\nMany different kinds of people live here. You can find food from many countries nearby. Within a short walk, you can get Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. Many people now use their phones to have food brought to their homes. There are also many places that sell fast food and pizza.\n\nYou can find everything you need in the stores here. There are places to clean clothes, drug stores, and a big food store that many people in this part of the country know well. There is even a store owned by Indian people where you can buy Indian food to cook or eat right away.\n\nI really like living in this area. When I read about problems other people have with their neighbors, I feel very lucky to live here.",
            "I live near my college, which makes me happy. My area has many apartment buildings and some places to eat and drink. These places do not cost too much money. One drinking place got a new name and costs more now, but it is still okay.\n\nThe people who live here are nice. Many are students or people who do not have much money, as the apartments are not expensive. There are many children here because a school is close by. I do not know the people who live next to me, and that is fine. They smoke a lot, so the building owners put something in the hall to make it smell better. My friend and I think this is funny.\n\nMost buildings here are old, but some are fixed up inside. New apartments were built down the street, but they were not built well. They cost too much money because they are close to school.\n\nThere is a very cheap eating place near me. They use paper plates and heat most food in a small cooking box. Next to it is a place to buy gas for cars. The city fixed the street last summer, adding new walking paths and grass, which made everything look better.\n\nMany trees grow around my building. Some were cut down, but we still have more trees than other places nearby. Behind my building are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and 43rd Street is behind us. That street does not look as nice. The walking paths are broken, and the buildings look old. The trees there help hide how the buildings look. Bad things sometimes happen in that area, and also across from where I live.\n\nStill, I like living here. I can pay for it, and everything I need is close. I like that I can walk to school, and I can take a bus to buy food or go to the city center.",
            "I live in a special group of connected houses. Each house joins with another, but they are built to look separate. All the houses are yellow with white front areas and green metal tops. Most people here are friends. In the evening, we often meet at the end of our roads to talk while children play with their toys or draw with chalk. Sometimes they fly kites. It feels like going back to an older time, away from today's world of computers.\n\nTrees and fields are all around us, with blue sky and white clouds above. The only bad thing is the dangerous storms we get. Last night, we heard warning sounds for a big wind storm. I had to hide in my bathroom with my small dog and some soft things to stay safe. My big dog stayed in the living room, making noise because he was afraid.\n\nThe storm brought ice balls that fell on the ground. After the storm, steam came from the road because the weather changed quickly. The temperature went from very hot to cool in just minutes. When the sun came out while it was still raining, two rainbows appeared in the sky. I took pictures to show my friends.\n\nI moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like how people talk with their southern way of speaking. My home has two rooms and two bathrooms. Even though all houses look the same outside, they are different inside. Some are very small.\n\nI enjoy walking in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there, but we cannot swim in it. I see deer sometimes, and in the morning, I hear big frogs making noise. I live forty minutes from the big city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. We even hear a donkey making noise in the evening from a close farm. I am very happy I found this nice place to live.",
            "I have lived in this area for ten years and would like to share my story. When we first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was very sad. I cried because I missed my old friends. However, my parents wanted better things for me and my younger sister. They chose this area because it had better houses and schools.\n\nOver time, I made new friends at school. I did not know many people who lived near us, except for Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, who live next door. They became like family to us. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister. It was a very happy day. At the wedding, I caught the small white band that Ms. Veda threw from her leg. We danced and had fun with their daughter Marsharii, though I have not seen her since then.\n\nOur area is like a maze, but now I use a map system to find my way. I often spent time with my friends Kason and Curtis playing games. I also like going to the park to enjoy nature, which helps me feel calm. I practice keeping my balance with sticks I bought from the store. The park has places to play basketball and tennis. When I was younger, my father taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many good memories here, and I believe more good times are coming.",
            "I live in a small town called Johnston in South Carolina. Our town is special because we grow many peaches. In fact, we call ourselves the Peach Capital of the World, and this is written on our welcome sign.\n\nMost of our land is used for growing peaches or raising cows. Houses outside the town center are far apart. These homes usually have two floors with metal or gray tops to help stay cool in the hot summer. Many houses sit far from the road, with fields in front for animals or growing food.\n\nIn the middle of town, we have one traffic light where four roads meet. This is where all our stores are. We have three places to eat: a Chinese family restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican place called Fiesta, and a burger place called Gary's. We also have a small drug store famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, and one food store called IGA. Many people drive to the bigger town of Batesburg-Leesville to shop at Walmart because IGA is expensive.\n\nOur busiest store is Dollar General, which sells many everyday things. We have a furniture store run by a nice woman who will send workers to bring furniture to your home. Next door is a place where people can take their pets for cleaning and care.\n\nWe have one doctor's office and one animal doctor's office. Both are small but take good care of our people and pets. Children go to Johnston Elementary School, but older students must go to school in another town.\n\nRight now, our town is building a new area for families to play and spend time outside. We don't have many places for fun like movie theaters or places to play. But even though our town is small - so small you might miss it when driving by - it is a nice place to live.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that joins two main roads, so many cars pass by each day. Still, it is mostly quiet here. Most people stay in their homes for many years, so we know our neighbors well.\n\nPeople here work in their yards and do daily tasks. In winter, children slide down a hill on our side street. Our house sits at the front of the street, letting us see who comes and goes. We know which cars belong here, so we notice when strange cars appear.\n\nSome neighbors walk for health or with their dogs. Children ride bikes in the street. My family stays home much of the time because we work here. There are four of us - my wife, two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen), and me. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we cook food on our back deck, which makes the air smell good.\n\nFrom spring to fall, someone is always cutting grass. We have many trees that give good shade, but they drop many leaves in fall. We must clean up these leaves and burn them. I like how burning leaves smell. The winters have been warm lately, making it feel like a long fall.\n\nOur garage is behind our house, so we rarely use the front door. I fix my truck and work on things in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nDuring holidays, it is very quiet here. At Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Mother's Day, families have visitors and many cars park on our street. I am happy living here. If fewer cars used our street as a way through, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the high desert. Here, there is mostly brown dirt everywhere you look. People who have not lived here may not understand what it is like to see brown all the time. When you see green grass, you know someone is paying a lot of money to keep it that way.\n\nI first came here in the 1990s. Back then, houses were far apart. It is still like that today, but there are more houses now. This place grows more like a city each day, as many places do. Most people here are friendly, but like all cities, there are good and bad areas. In my part of town, I live near nice older people.\n\nThe stores here are mostly big chain stores. We do not have expensive stores nearby. You must travel far to find those. Many people here work in building houses and buildings. This is because our city still has much empty space to build on. This worries me because I like how things are now. I left a big city and do not want to live in one again. I work in building too, putting up walls inside houses.\n\nWhat I like most are the animals here. Many people come to the high desert to see its simple beauty. The weather and land here make it special for plants and animals. People who live here should learn about these animals to live safely with them. My family likes the wildlife very much. My three children love looking for lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch some.\n\nWe have some interesting places to visit. The San Bernardino County Fair comes every year. Near us is Wrightwood, where you can see snow on mountains and learn winter sports. If you want to learn about desert history, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has old rocks, bones, Native American items, and things that show how our city grew over time.",
            "My neighborhood is different from what most people might describe. I live on a college campus, and my community is made up of the students who live in the same buildings. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood.\n\nEven though my neighborhood is special, it is like other neighborhoods in many ways. It has places to live, people, stores, and a park. Let me tell you about the different places where people live here.\n\nThere are three kinds of homes in my area. First, there are apartment buildings where two to four people share one room. Each building usually has two floors with four to six rooms on each floor. About twenty people live in each apartment building.\n\nSecond, there are regular houses that people who work at or graduated from the school can rent. These houses usually have two to four bedrooms, but there are not many of them.\n\nThird, there are the big dormitory buildings where hundreds of students live. Most rooms in these buildings are shared by two students. This is the most common type of housing here.\n\nThe people who live in my neighborhood come from many different places and cultures. The teachers and workers usually live in the houses. New students live in the dormitories, while older students often live in the apartments.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores and a park. Because the school is like its own small town, we can find everything we need here. There are places to eat, shops that sell school clothes, and stores that sell food. The park is a place where everyone can spend time outside. All of us who live here help keep it clean and safe.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. People who exercise like to run up this hill. Because there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes, making it hard to drive on.\n\nPower lines run all around our area. They often look broken because strong rain and wind cause tree branches to fall on them. Many tall green trees grow here, but people do not like them. They cut down trees because the trees block the view of the water.\n\nThe houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows on their upper floors to see the water. When the sun goes down, the water looks beautiful and bright, and the sky turns orange. Most days are gray and wet. Green plant growth covers many things like house tops and cars. One time, I left my car outside for many days, and it turned green. It took me a long time to clean it.\n\nNot many young people live here, even though there is a school nearby. Most people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Many people have dogs instead of children. The dogs often run in yards or on the street. Sometimes they even come into houses if doors are left open.\n\nThere are many rabbits here. They dig holes in people's yards and hurt the plants. My cats catch many of them. We also see many birds: small ones, very tiny fast ones, and big hunting birds. The black birds chase away the big hunting birds.\n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you walk down to the water, you can eat at places that serve fish. There is not much sand by the water, but you can throw rocks into it. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side most days, even when it is not clear.",
            "Bensonhurst is an area in Brooklyn, New York City that is easy to find. You can get there using public transportation, which many people in New York City use. The area feels like a city neighborhood.\n\nWhen you visit, you will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You can find Asian-owned stores on almost every street. There are many food stores and places to wash clothes. Local people like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and the stores are close to their homes. Near my home, there are four Asian food stores within a short walk.\n\nThe area has people from many different places. Many people who live here came from other countries, and their children were born in America. While many businesses are owned by Asian people, the area also has a nice park. The park has many places to play basketball, an open field for games, places for handball, and areas for children to play. In summer, children can play in the water. People from different backgrounds play together well in the park.\n\nMost people live in two-family houses, though there are some apartment buildings. The people are friendly but can be loud. Cars often play loud music, and some drivers make noise with their cars early in the morning.\n\nAt night, you should be careful. While the area is mostly safe, some people might cause problems. There have been cases of stealing and fighting. Also, even though there are rules about cleaning up after dogs, some people do not follow them. You might see dog waste on the streets when walking to the train or stores.\n\nDespite these problems, Bensonhurst is still a good place to visit, but remember to watch where you walk to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Let me tell you about Portland, Oregon. People here like to say \"Keep Portland Strange.\" This saying is painted on a building that has many different businesses inside it.\n\nSome people want Portland to stay like it was twenty years ago. Back then, it was less known and cost less to live here. Other people come here because they want to be different, and that is good here.\n\nMany rich people are moving to Portland from California. New buildings are going up everywhere. But Portland is still different from other cities. We have normal things, like stores and offices. We also have special things you might not see elsewhere.\n\nIn my part of the city, the houses are painted in bright colors. People grow flowers and food in their front yards. In summer, we put boxes on the street with free things inside. You might find clothes, books, or other nice things that someone does not want anymore.\n\nSome people here do unusual activities. They do exercises with small goats, or they watch soccer games. Others like to spend time at bars. Like other cities, Portland has problems. Some people do not have homes. Others have problems with drugs. The rain and dark clouds for much of the year make some people feel sad.\n\nThe city tries to help people who need it. We do more than many other cities, but it is still not enough. Some people care a lot about helping others, while some do not. In this way, Portland is like any other city in America.",
            "The mountains stand in the north. They watch the sun rise and set each day. Even when I am too busy with work to notice them, they remain strong and unchanging. On my hardest days, when worry fills my mind, I look to these mountains. They help me find peace and give me strength to continue.\n\nI came here as a student. The mountains near the school caught my attention first. The school itself is beautiful, with nice buildings and small lakes with trees. But the mountains are special to me. \n\nThe town is lovely too. There are many coffee shops where I spent long hours studying. A short bus ride takes you to the old part of town, where old red and brown buildings hold restaurants and offices. This area feels as busy as a big city. But walk past the library, and you find quiet streets again. The mix of busy and quiet areas makes this place special, like it wants you to explore it.\n\nI have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends by the old park swings after staying up all night. I remember running to catch movies at the nice theater downtown. But sad memories live here too. I often sat by the small lakes late at night, thinking about life while watching turtles and ducks swim. I would sometimes cry there, wondering about my place in the world.\n\nOne day, I walked past the lake, through the quiet streets with small houses, until I reached a main road. The sun was rising, making the palm trees glow. I looked up and saw I was walking north. And there they were - the mountains, touching the blue and yellow morning sky. Without words, they reminded me to stay strong and keep going.",
            "At first, you might not see it. Behind the stores is a place where people live. If you walk past the old, empty food store and the hotels that are mostly quiet except in summer, you will find many people living there.\n\nOn these streets, there are several apartment buildings. They stand next to each other in a line, like boxes that get smaller and smaller. The first apartments you see have had some problems, so we will not talk about them much. The other apartment buildings next to it are different and special. Most people who live in this area do not know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. Students come early in the morning with their coffee. They enter through big metal gates while people in cars wait, sometimes becoming angry at the slow traffic.\n\nThe street meets another street where there is a park on one side and a medical center on the other. The medical center has chairs on its front porch and a fan that moves slowly in the hot summer air. At the park, children play and run in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers near the road. Older people walk their dogs on the path. They look unhappy at young people on skateboards but smile at young girls who talk about boys near the play equipment.\n\nNext to the park is a small group of stores. There is a place that serves Japanese food, a store that sells things for swimming pools, and a place where people get their nails done. There is also a store that sells cold sweet treats. Young people often buy these treats and eat them while they play in the park.\n\nThis neighborhood is like many places in the American South. It is quiet and does not change much over time.",
            "I want to tell you about where I live. The houses in my area are mostly for one family. Some houses have been made into two homes that share walls. My house has a small green space in front and a place for cars on the left side.\n\nThe houses here make people think about how life was better in the past. Many people wanted to live in places like this years ago. Now, fewer people want this kind of life. But our area, and many others like it, show that this way of life continues.\n\nPeople here may not feel as happy as before. The small yards may not look as nice. But every house has cars outside, and children still play in the streets. The school has been here for many years. It gives young people hope for tomorrow, while older people remember their school days there.\n\nThere are not many churches now, and few people go to them. But many young people still play basketball. Each house looks different, but they all feel like home. There is a big food store run by a family from Yemen. Most people who live here are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play games here, moving only when cars need to pass. Many families have lived here for many years. They remember when everyone knew their neighbors.\n\nWe used to have a place where children learned fighting sports. Now it is a drug store. We have a small movie house that shows old films for less money. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it.\n\nA big road passes near our town, but you cannot get on it here. Young people wanted a way to get on the big road from our town. Older people said no because they thought it would hurt our town. The older people won.\n\nWe are building a new school for older students. We are trying to pick an animal or thing to represent our town. I think we should choose something that shows both old and new ideas about our town.",
            "I live in a big city where many different kinds of people live together. My area has homes mixed with places where people work and shop. There are many offices, stores, restaurants, and places where people go to have fun. We always have new places to eat and shop. Some stores are part of big companies that everyone knows, but there are also many small stores owned by local people. These stores are in shopping centers and along the streets near quiet living areas.\n\nWe have parks nearby where families bring their children to play. Many different groups of people live in my area. We have gay and lesbian people, Jewish people who follow their old ways, and people who came here from Russia and nearby countries. If you go a little farther in our city, you find areas where people from Korea, China, and Armenia live together.\n\nGetting around the city is hard. A ten-mile trip can take two hours when there are many cars on the road. Most people drive cars instead of walking, even though some places are close by. This makes it hard to find places to park, and the roads are very busy.\n\nIn recent years, workers have built many tall buildings where people can live. While many people want to move here, those who already live here worry about more cars and people coming. We have different kinds of homes in our city. Some people live in big buildings, while others live in single homes or small apartment buildings. Some buildings have two homes in them.\n\nPeople of all ages live in my area, but I do not know many of my neighbors well. When I was young, I played outside with the children who lived next door, but now people do not spend as much time with their neighbors.",
            "\"What do you see here?\" she asked as we drove past endless fields of corn. \"This is all there is!\" I replied. I knew she would be surprised by how empty it looked. She grew up in a town where she could walk to buy food in five minutes. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nAs I showed her the wide fields, I told her about growing up in Ohio's farming area. This helped her understand who I was and where I came from. On the small road, you will find a water-filled hole in the ground. My house is just past it, in a group of homes. The houses are made of brick and have large yards. People here work hard to keep their yards looking nice.\n\nIn spring, many flowers grow next to trees that change with each season. Nice cars sit in every driveway, clean and bright in the sun. Near my gray house, my neighbor from Korea often works in his yard. He cuts grass all day and sings while he works. Everyone smiles when they see him. He used to be a doctor, but now he spends his days on his riding grass cutter.\n\nAt my house, birds walk in the yard while our small dog runs after them. Behind the house, there is a small stream that runs to the water hole. You can hear frogs, running water, and cows from nearby farms. Across a wooden bridge we built, there is an open area with trees, plants, and wild flowers. I spent much of my young life there.\n\nI built houses in trees and chased animals with friends from nearby homes. The cold times are hard, but they are beautiful. The green yard becomes white and empty. Trees that had bright flowers become bare. When snow falls, it makes everything white and pretty. My younger sister made snow shapes on the ground and built snow people. We often threw snow at each other and built snow walls with branches. In our special place, we played and did not worry about anything. We were just children having fun."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a small town in Michigan. Our area has farms and small places where visitors come. We do not have big stores or many restaurants. We must drive to get anywhere we need to go.\n\nStill, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world. My town sits between two large lakes - Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find places to put your feet in the water everywhere you go.\n\nMy neighborhood shows what small-town life is like. The houses are not close together. Each house looks different from the others. Many are old houses, and some people are making them look newer. Most houses have rooms under the ground that you can see from the street. The houses have different colors, and most have yards where children can play. Some people grow plants for food, and others have places for their animals.\n\nThe people who live here work hard and raise their families. You can see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs and ride their bikes. Neighbors know each other, and we can tell who lives here and who does not. People cooking food outside will wave to you, and those walking their dogs will smile.\n\nEveryone takes good care of their yards. The grass is always cut, and the plants are kept neat. When you drive through our neighborhood, you might think it would be a good place to raise children. It is quiet and safe.\n\nNear us, we have important buildings like the police station and health office. We have places to play baseball, and a small airport where planes take off and land. Children can walk to get ice cream or ride their bikes to the park. We can even walk to the center of town.\n\nThis is a very good place to live.",
            "I live in an area that looks like many other places where people live outside big cities. My neighborhood has many rules because a group of homeowners controls how things look. When you come in, you see many houses that look the same. Each house has a small green area in front with rocks and small trees. Every house has space for two cars.\n\nThe roads are very good because they are new and well-kept. Most houses are one floor high, but some have two floors. We do not have mail boxes in front of our houses. Instead, we have many mail boxes together at the end of the street. Everyone has a key to get their mail. There are also two bigger boxes for larger items.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city, where the city meets the country. We have a lot of space here. There are several swimming pools that people who live here can use. The pools have gates and are kept clean. There are also paths where people can walk their dogs or take walks. You do not need to go to a park to exercise because our neighborhood is big enough to run in.\n\nMost people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Some younger working people live here too. It is very safe, and people watch out for each other. Our city is big when you count the people, but it feels small. We have most things people need. We have one shopping center. It is not very big, but it works well for us.\n\nIt takes about fifteen minutes by car to get to stores. We have many different kinds of stores. Some sell healthy food that costs more, and others sell fewer things for less money. My neighborhood is safe and well-kept. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. While stores are not very close, you can drive to any store you want.",
            "I first learned about my home while listening to a radio show about missing people. This was unexpected. Most homes in this area cost more than one thousand dollars each month to live in. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Perhaps it shows how hard life can be. Some of my friends cry at night because things cost so much money. We have learned to live with less over time.\n\nYou get used to buying old things from markets. The smell of old clothes and toys becomes normal. As you grow up, you notice smells less. Some people start smoking. Others just get used to how things are. But the market smell is always there. Growing up means having old books on an unused piano. The smell stays in everything, even after washing.\n\nThere are three used-goods stores near my home. You can walk to two charity stores, a library, a special book store, and a shop with unusual things. Many cars and people fill the streets every morning, but the stores are quiet inside. It is peaceful to spend time there. Each year, more people come to our city. A big computer shopping company has its main office here. The city is still growing, like New York. Everyone follows their own path, and no one asks much of you. You can be by yourself, and people will not bother you. It is different from the South, where people show they care by asking questions. Here, you can keep to yourself.\n\nThe city is full of life. My neighbor plays piano, and two people above me sing. We are not just people living near each other - we are friends. We help each other, share happy and sad times, and care for one another. I am happy to be here. My neighbors are good people, and we are kind to each other. We share food and help with mail. Even though I live in a big, cold city, my neighbors make it feel like home.",
            "I live in a small town near a big city in the middle part of America. My neighborhood is on the east side of town, where many people do not have much money. Most houses here are not expensive, and many people rent their homes. Still, it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are friendly and say hello when they see me.\n\nWhile crime is a bit higher here than in other parts of town, it is still mostly safe. There have been some bad events near my home in the past ten years, including some shootings. Our neighbors lost their son last year when he was shot near a local bar. My family has been lucky, with only small things sometimes being taken from our front area when we forget to bring them inside.\n\nLike many places in America, our town has problems with dangerous drugs. Many people have died from taking these drugs. However, there are places in town that help people who have drug problems, and there are classes to teach people how to help someone who has taken too many drugs.\n\nEven with these problems, there are many good things about our town. My son goes to a very good school with wonderful teachers and leaders. Even though he has special needs, other children are kind to him, and he is very happy there. Parents and teachers work together to make the school better. Because many families in town do not have much money, all children get free food at school. No one is treated badly because they cannot pay, and school activities do not cost much money.\n\nThe town leaders have made the town look better by fixing roads and parks. However, most of this work has been done in the middle and west parts of town, where most stores are. The east side, where I live, often does not get these improvements. This makes people in my area unhappy.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are enough stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable and good enough for us. We have lived here for more than 16 years, and we want to stay here.",
            "I live in a special part of town called Hilltop. It sits on top of a hill, with many old buildings around it. My home is in a tall building across from a theater. Down the street, there is a place where people play games and drink. In summer, many people wait in line to go inside.\n\nNear my home is a city park. The park is big and has many concrete steps around it. In winter, people without homes put their tents on these steps. It does not snow much here, but it rains a lot. These people stay close together to keep warm. They can walk to a place where they can wash and get help.\n\nWhat makes this place special is not just the old buildings or the way they look. It is the people who live here. Years ago, this area was known for having problems with groups who did bad things. The government tried to stop these problems. People still tell stories about those times.\n\nToday, people work hard to make our area better. Some say white people should not walk here at night. I think this idea comes from old fears. Maybe it is because my skin is a darker color, or maybe because people here know me, but I feel safe. This place shows how people still have wrong ideas about others who look different from them.\n\nNo matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. People here are kind. Once, when I needed to charge my phone, a shop owner let me stay late. When I had nowhere to go in the rain, people helped me. One time, when I was sitting alone on the street, someone gave me money and told me I was worth something. These are the things that make Hilltop special to me.",
            "I came to live in this area when I was thirteen years old. At first, it was not easy to find friends, but I became close with two boys who lived on my street. They have moved away now, but I still remember our time together. Most of the same people who lived here when I first came still live here today.\n\nMy area looks like many other places where Americans live outside big cities. There are many houses with two floors. When the weather is warm, I can hear children playing outside. Most days are quiet here. I have never had trouble with anyone who lives nearby. People here leave you alone unless you need help. When I get things sent to my house, no one takes them. I feel safe with my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park very close to my house. I have many good memories there. I played many games there with other boys from the area. Once, I got hurt playing football, but most of my memories are happy ones. Now, I take my young cousins to the park. They love the swings and slides. When I tell them we are going to the park, they get very happy. The park makes me think of many good times from my past.\n\nMany different kinds of people live here. You can find food from many countries nearby. Within a short walk, you can get Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. Many people now use their phones to have food brought to their homes. There are also many places that sell fast food and pizza.\n\nYou can find everything you need in the stores here. There are places to clean clothes, drug stores, and a big food store that many people in this part of the country know well. There is even a store owned by Indian people where you can buy Indian food to cook or eat right away.\n\nI really like living in this area. When I read about problems other people have with their neighbors, I feel very lucky to live here.",
            "I live near my college, which makes me happy. My area has many apartment buildings and some places to eat and drink. These places do not cost too much money. One drinking place got a new name and costs more now, but it is still okay.\n\nThe people who live here are nice. Many are students or people who do not have much money, as the apartments are not expensive. There are many children here because a school is close by. I do not know the people who live next to me, and that is fine. They smoke a lot, so the building owners put something in the hall to make it smell better. My friend and I think this is funny.\n\nMost buildings here are old, but some are fixed up inside. New apartments were built down the street, but they were not built well. They cost too much money because they are close to school.\n\nThere is a very cheap eating place near me. They use paper plates and heat most food in a small cooking box. Next to it is a place to buy gas for cars. The city fixed the street last summer, adding new walking paths and grass, which made everything look better.\n\nMany trees grow around my building. Some were cut down, but we still have more trees than other places nearby. Behind my building are more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and 43rd Street is behind us. That street does not look as nice. The walking paths are broken, and the buildings look old. The trees there help hide how the buildings look. Bad things sometimes happen in that area, and also across from where I live.\n\nStill, I like living here. I can pay for it, and everything I need is close. I like that I can walk to school, and I can take a bus to buy food or go to the city center.",
            "I live in a special group of connected houses. Each house joins with another, but they are built to look separate. All the houses are yellow with white front areas and green metal tops. Most people here are friends. In the evening, we often meet at the end of our roads to talk while children play with their toys or draw with chalk. Sometimes they fly kites. It feels like going back to an older time, away from today's world of computers.\n\nTrees and fields are all around us, with blue sky and white clouds above. The only bad thing is the dangerous storms we get. Last night, we heard warning sounds for a big wind storm. I had to hide in my bathroom with my small dog and some soft things to stay safe. My big dog stayed in the living room, making noise because he was afraid.\n\nThe storm brought ice balls that fell on the ground. After the storm, steam came from the road because the weather changed quickly. The temperature went from very hot to cool in just minutes. When the sun came out while it was still raining, two rainbows appeared in the sky. I took pictures to show my friends.\n\nI moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like how people talk with their southern way of speaking. My home has two rooms and two bathrooms. Even though all houses look the same outside, they are different inside. Some are very small.\n\nI enjoy walking in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there, but we cannot swim in it. I see deer sometimes, and in the morning, I hear big frogs making noise. I live forty minutes from the big city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters from nearby farms. It feels like a small village. We even hear a donkey making noise in the evening from a close farm. I am very happy I found this nice place to live.",
            "I have lived in this area for ten years and would like to share my story. When we first moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was very sad. I cried because I missed my old friends. However, my parents wanted better things for me and my younger sister. They chose this area because it had better houses and schools.\n\nOver time, I made new friends at school. I did not know many people who lived near us, except for Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, who live next door. They became like family to us. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding with my parents and sister. It was a very happy day. At the wedding, I caught the small white band that Ms. Veda threw from her leg. We danced and had fun with their daughter Marsharii, though I have not seen her since then.\n\nOur area is like a maze, but now I use a map system to find my way. I often spent time with my friends Kason and Curtis playing games. I also like going to the park to enjoy nature, which helps me feel calm. I practice keeping my balance with sticks I bought from the store. The park has places to play basketball and tennis. When I was younger, my father taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. They made us work hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many good memories here, and I believe more good times are coming.",
            "I live in a small town called Johnston in South Carolina. Our town is special because we grow many peaches. In fact, we call ourselves the Peach Capital of the World, and this is written on our welcome sign.\n\nMost of our land is used for growing peaches or raising cows. Houses outside the town center are far apart. These homes usually have two floors with metal or gray tops to help stay cool in the hot summer. Many houses sit far from the road, with fields in front for animals or growing food.\n\nIn the middle of town, we have one traffic light where four roads meet. This is where all our stores are. We have three places to eat: a Chinese family restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican place called Fiesta, and a burger place called Gary's. We also have a small drug store famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, and one food store called IGA. Many people drive to the bigger town of Batesburg-Leesville to shop at Walmart because IGA is expensive.\n\nOur busiest store is Dollar General, which sells many everyday things. We have a furniture store run by a nice woman who will send workers to bring furniture to your home. Next door is a place where people can take their pets for cleaning and care.\n\nWe have one doctor's office and one animal doctor's office. Both are small but take good care of our people and pets. Children go to Johnston Elementary School, but older students must go to school in another town.\n\nRight now, our town is building a new area for families to play and spend time outside. We don't have many places for fun like movie theaters or places to play. But even though our town is small - so small you might miss it when driving by - it is a nice place to live.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that joins two main roads, so many cars pass by each day. Still, it is mostly quiet here. Most people stay in their homes for many years, so we know our neighbors well.\n\nPeople here work in their yards and do daily tasks. In winter, children slide down a hill on our side street. Our house sits at the front of the street, letting us see who comes and goes. We know which cars belong here, so we notice when strange cars appear.\n\nSome neighbors walk for health or with their dogs. Children ride bikes in the street. My family stays home much of the time because we work here. There are four of us - my wife, two daughters (ages eleven and fourteen), and me. We play outside, even in the rain. Sometimes we cook food on our back deck, which makes the air smell good.\n\nFrom spring to fall, someone is always cutting grass. We have many trees that give good shade, but they drop many leaves in fall. We must clean up these leaves and burn them. I like how burning leaves smell. The winters have been warm lately, making it feel like a long fall.\n\nOur garage is behind our house, so we rarely use the front door. I fix my truck and work on things in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nDuring holidays, it is very quiet here. At Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Mother's Day, families have visitors and many cars park on our street. I am happy living here. If fewer cars used our street as a way through, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in the high desert. Here, there is mostly brown dirt everywhere you look. People who have not lived here may not understand what it is like to see brown all the time. When you see green grass, you know someone is paying a lot of money to keep it that way.\n\nI first came here in the 1990s. Back then, houses were far apart. It is still like that today, but there are more houses now. This place grows more like a city each day, as many places do. Most people here are friendly, but like all cities, there are good and bad areas. In my part of town, I live near nice older people.\n\nThe stores here are mostly big chain stores. We do not have expensive stores nearby. You must travel far to find those. Many people here work in building houses and buildings. This is because our city still has much empty space to build on. This worries me because I like how things are now. I left a big city and do not want to live in one again. I work in building too, putting up walls inside houses.\n\nWhat I like most are the animals here. Many people come to the high desert to see its simple beauty. The weather and land here make it special for plants and animals. People who live here should learn about these animals to live safely with them. My family likes the wildlife very much. My three children love looking for lizards and desert bugs. Right now, they are outside trying to catch some.\n\nWe have some interesting places to visit. The San Bernardino County Fair comes every year. Near us is Wrightwood, where you can see snow on mountains and learn winter sports. If you want to learn about desert history, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has old rocks, bones, Native American items, and things that show how our city grew over time.",
            "My neighborhood is different from what most people might describe. I live on a college campus, and my community is made up of the students who live in the same buildings. The campus around me is also part of my neighborhood.\n\nEven though my neighborhood is special, it is like other neighborhoods in many ways. It has places to live, people, stores, and a park. Let me tell you about the different places where people live here.\n\nThere are three kinds of homes in my area. First, there are apartment buildings where two to four people share one room. Each building usually has two floors with four to six rooms on each floor. About twenty people live in each apartment building.\n\nSecond, there are regular houses that people who work at or graduated from the school can rent. These houses usually have two to four bedrooms, but there are not many of them.\n\nThird, there are the big dormitory buildings where hundreds of students live. Most rooms in these buildings are shared by two students. This is the most common type of housing here.\n\nThe people who live in my neighborhood come from many different places and cultures. The teachers and workers usually live in the houses. New students live in the dormitories, while older students often live in the apartments.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores and a park. Because the school is like its own small town, we can find everything we need here. There are places to eat, shops that sell school clothes, and stores that sell food. The park is a place where everyone can spend time outside. All of us who live here help keep it clean and safe.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. My house is at the top of a very steep hill. People who exercise like to run up this hill. Because there are no sidewalks, everyone walks on the road. The road has holes, making it hard to drive on.\n\nPower lines run all around our area. They often look broken because strong rain and wind cause tree branches to fall on them. Many tall green trees grow here, but people do not like them. They cut down trees because the trees block the view of the water.\n\nThe houses are built high on the hill. They have big windows on their upper floors to see the water. When the sun goes down, the water looks beautiful and bright, and the sky turns orange. Most days are gray and wet. Green plant growth covers many things like house tops and cars. One time, I left my car outside for many days, and it turned green. It took me a long time to clean it.\n\nNot many young people live here, even though there is a school nearby. Most people who live here are older and do not work anymore. Many people have dogs instead of children. The dogs often run in yards or on the street. Sometimes they even come into houses if doors are left open.\n\nThere are many rabbits here. They dig holes in people's yards and hurt the plants. My cats catch many of them. We also see many birds: small ones, very tiny fast ones, and big hunting birds. The black birds chase away the big hunting birds.\n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you walk down to the water, you can eat at places that serve fish. There is not much sand by the water, but you can throw rocks into it. The water is not very wide. You can see the other side most days, even when it is not clear.",
            "Bensonhurst is an area in Brooklyn, New York City that is easy to find. You can get there using public transportation, which many people in New York City use. The area feels like a city neighborhood.\n\nWhen you visit, you will see many Asian stores. In the past twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. You can find Asian-owned stores on almost every street. There are many food stores and places to wash clothes. Local people like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and the stores are close to their homes. Near my home, there are four Asian food stores within a short walk.\n\nThe area has people from many different places. Many people who live here came from other countries, and their children were born in America. While many businesses are owned by Asian people, the area also has a nice park. The park has many places to play basketball, an open field for games, places for handball, and areas for children to play. In summer, children can play in the water. People from different backgrounds play together well in the park.\n\nMost people live in two-family houses, though there are some apartment buildings. The people are friendly but can be loud. Cars often play loud music, and some drivers make noise with their cars early in the morning.\n\nAt night, you should be careful. While the area is mostly safe, some people might cause problems. There have been cases of stealing and fighting. Also, even though there are rules about cleaning up after dogs, some people do not follow them. You might see dog waste on the streets when walking to the train or stores.\n\nDespite these problems, Bensonhurst is still a good place to visit, but remember to watch where you walk to keep your shoes clean!",
            "Let me tell you about Portland, Oregon. People here like to say \"Keep Portland Strange.\" This saying is painted on a building that has many different businesses inside it.\n\nSome people want Portland to stay like it was twenty years ago. Back then, it was less known and cost less to live here. Other people come here because they want to be different, and that is good here.\n\nMany rich people are moving to Portland from California. New buildings are going up everywhere. But Portland is still different from other cities. We have normal things, like stores and offices. We also have special things you might not see elsewhere.\n\nIn my part of the city, the houses are painted in bright colors. People grow flowers and food in their front yards. In summer, we put boxes on the street with free things inside. You might find clothes, books, or other nice things that someone does not want anymore.\n\nSome people here do unusual activities. They do exercises with small goats, or they watch soccer games. Others like to spend time at bars. Like other cities, Portland has problems. Some people do not have homes. Others have problems with drugs. The rain and dark clouds for much of the year make some people feel sad.\n\nThe city tries to help people who need it. We do more than many other cities, but it is still not enough. Some people care a lot about helping others, while some do not. In this way, Portland is like any other city in America.",
            "The mountains stand in the north. They watch the sun rise and set each day. Even when I am too busy with work to notice them, they remain strong and unchanging. On my hardest days, when worry fills my mind, I look to these mountains. They help me find peace and give me strength to continue.\n\nI came here as a student. The mountains near the school caught my attention first. The school itself is beautiful, with nice buildings and small lakes with trees. But the mountains are special to me. \n\nThe town is lovely too. There are many coffee shops where I spent long hours studying. A short bus ride takes you to the old part of town, where old red and brown buildings hold restaurants and offices. This area feels as busy as a big city. But walk past the library, and you find quiet streets again. The mix of busy and quiet areas makes this place special, like it wants you to explore it.\n\nI have many good memories here. I remember walking with friends by the old park swings after staying up all night. I remember running to catch movies at the nice theater downtown. But sad memories live here too. I often sat by the small lakes late at night, thinking about life while watching turtles and ducks swim. I would sometimes cry there, wondering about my place in the world.\n\nOne day, I walked past the lake, through the quiet streets with small houses, until I reached a main road. The sun was rising, making the palm trees glow. I looked up and saw I was walking north. And there they were - the mountains, touching the blue and yellow morning sky. Without words, they reminded me to stay strong and keep going.",
            "At first, you might not see it. Behind the stores is a place where people live. If you walk past the old, empty food store and the hotels that are mostly quiet except in summer, you will find many people living there.\n\nOn these streets, there are several apartment buildings. They stand next to each other in a line, like boxes that get smaller and smaller. The first apartments you see have had some problems, so we will not talk about them much. The other apartment buildings next to it are different and special. Most people who live in this area do not know about them.\n\nAcross the street is a small college. Students come early in the morning with their coffee. They enter through big metal gates while people in cars wait, sometimes becoming angry at the slow traffic.\n\nThe street meets another street where there is a park on one side and a medical center on the other. The medical center has chairs on its front porch and a fan that moves slowly in the hot summer air. At the park, children play and run in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers near the road. Older people walk their dogs on the path. They look unhappy at young people on skateboards but smile at young girls who talk about boys near the play equipment.\n\nNext to the park is a small group of stores. There is a place that serves Japanese food, a store that sells things for swimming pools, and a place where people get their nails done. There is also a store that sells cold sweet treats. Young people often buy these treats and eat them while they play in the park.\n\nThis neighborhood is like many places in the American South. It is quiet and does not change much over time.",
            "I want to tell you about where I live. The houses in my area are mostly for one family. Some houses have been made into two homes that share walls. My house has a small green space in front and a place for cars on the left side.\n\nThe houses here make people think about how life was better in the past. Many people wanted to live in places like this years ago. Now, fewer people want this kind of life. But our area, and many others like it, show that this way of life continues.\n\nPeople here may not feel as happy as before. The small yards may not look as nice. But every house has cars outside, and children still play in the streets. The school has been here for many years. It gives young people hope for tomorrow, while older people remember their school days there.\n\nThere are not many churches now, and few people go to them. But many young people still play basketball. Each house looks different, but they all feel like home. There is a big food store run by a family from Yemen. Most people who live here are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Children play games here, moving only when cars need to pass. Many families have lived here for many years. They remember when everyone knew their neighbors.\n\nWe used to have a place where children learned fighting sports. Now it is a drug store. We have a small movie house that shows old films for less money. Young people do not go there much, but older people like it.\n\nA big road passes near our town, but you cannot get on it here. Young people wanted a way to get on the big road from our town. Older people said no because they thought it would hurt our town. The older people won.\n\nWe are building a new school for older students. We are trying to pick an animal or thing to represent our town. I think we should choose something that shows both old and new ideas about our town.",
            "I live in a big city where many different kinds of people live together. My area has homes mixed with places where people work and shop. There are many offices, stores, restaurants, and places where people go to have fun. We always have new places to eat and shop. Some stores are part of big companies that everyone knows, but there are also many small stores owned by local people. These stores are in shopping centers and along the streets near quiet living areas.\n\nWe have parks nearby where families bring their children to play. Many different groups of people live in my area. We have gay and lesbian people, Jewish people who follow their old ways, and people who came here from Russia and nearby countries. If you go a little farther in our city, you find areas where people from Korea, China, and Armenia live together.\n\nGetting around the city is hard. A ten-mile trip can take two hours when there are many cars on the road. Most people drive cars instead of walking, even though some places are close by. This makes it hard to find places to park, and the roads are very busy.\n\nIn recent years, workers have built many tall buildings where people can live. While many people want to move here, those who already live here worry about more cars and people coming. We have different kinds of homes in our city. Some people live in big buildings, while others live in single homes or small apartment buildings. Some buildings have two homes in them.\n\nPeople of all ages live in my area, but I do not know many of my neighbors well. When I was young, I played outside with the children who lived next door, but now people do not spend as much time with their neighbors.",
            "\"What do you see here?\" she asked as we drove past endless fields of corn. \"This is all there is!\" I replied. I knew she would be surprised by how empty it looked. She grew up in a town where she could walk to buy food in five minutes. She had never seen so much open land before.\n\nAs I showed her the wide fields, I told her about growing up in Ohio's farming area. This helped her understand who I was and where I came from. On the small road, you will find a water-filled hole in the ground. My house is just past it, in a group of homes. The houses are made of brick and have large yards. People here work hard to keep their yards looking nice.\n\nIn spring, many flowers grow next to trees that change with each season. Nice cars sit in every driveway, clean and bright in the sun. Near my gray house, my neighbor from Korea often works in his yard. He cuts grass all day and sings while he works. Everyone smiles when they see him. He used to be a doctor, but now he spends his days on his riding grass cutter.\n\nAt my house, birds walk in the yard while our small dog runs after them. Behind the house, there is a small stream that runs to the water hole. You can hear frogs, running water, and cows from nearby farms. Across a wooden bridge we built, there is an open area with trees, plants, and wild flowers. I spent much of my young life there.\n\nI built houses in trees and chased animals with friends from nearby homes. The cold times are hard, but they are beautiful. The green yard becomes white and empty. Trees that had bright flowers become bare. When snow falls, it makes everything white and pretty. My younger sister made snow shapes on the ground and built snow people. We often threw snow at each other and built snow walls with branches. In our special place, we played and did not worry about anything. We were just children having fun."
