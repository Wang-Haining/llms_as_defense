            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

The people in my area are also diverse, including a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish population, and former Soviet refugees. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is dotted with ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, travel within the city can be challenging due to heavy traffic, with even short distances taking hours during peak times.

            "My neighborhood is unique and charming. The majority of homes are single-family dwellings, but some have been divided into two, while maintaining their connection. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a nostalgic feeling of the American dream of suburban living, which once united the country, though nowadays it seems to be fading. However, neighborhoods like mine and many others still stand as a testament to this dream, even if it's no longer as vibrant as it once was. The residents, though maybe not as optimistic as before, still maintain their homes and yards, with cars in almost every driveway and children playing as if the world is their playground. The local school, nearly a century old, still inspires the youth while stirring up memories for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its own character, yet a shared feel of history. There's a large supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide and children often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations, and they share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school now houses a pharmacy, reflecting the changing interests of the youth. An old movie theater, favored by the elderly, shows classic films at discounted prices, drawing fewer youth who prefer newer releases. The nearest expressway is just outside of town, with an exit and entrance in the neighboring town. A petition to bring the expressway to our town was supported by the youth but rejected by the elders, who feared it would ruin their locality.

However, venture past the abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that only operate during peak seasons, and you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged neatly like Russian nesting dolls, side by side. The first set of apartments has made headlines for unsavory incidents, so they won't be the focus, as appearances can be deceiving.

            "“Where are we?” she inquired as we passed expansive fields of corn, stretching endlessly to the horizon. “This way!” I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute walk from her home; she'd never witnessed such an extent of unbroken landscape. Taken aback by the omnipresent cornfields, I recounted my upbringing in rural Ohio to her, and in that instant, she understood my origins better. On a two-lane rural road, a water-filled quarry comes into view, followed by my modest subdivision. The homes, mostly brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. In spring, vibrant flowers and the changing foliage of midwestern trees adorn the driveways, where luxury Mercedes-Benzes gleam after a thorough wash. As we draw closer to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always nearby, tending to his lawn while singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Known for his kindness and unique past as a doctor, he’s often seen as a figure of amusement for his antics but loved for his genuine nature. Continuing past him, we arrive at my home.

Around back, a small stream connects to the quarry, providing a symphony of bullfrogs’ croaks, the stream’s flow, and occasional “moos” from neighboring farms.

This was my haven during childhood, filled with forts, imaginary hunts, and endless play opportunities. Winter in my small town can be harsh, yet the barren beauty is unparalleled. Trees shed their vibrant leaves, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland after a snowfall, where snow angels and snowmen dot the backyard. My sister and I would often clash as kids, but during winter, our weapon of choice was snowballs, building massive igloo-like forts with branches. Snowdrifts created our own magical realm, where we engaged in pretend play, free from worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is known for its eccentricity, a fact celebrated by the city's unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" emblazoned on a multi-purpose building housing a pizza shop, bar, music venue, and a strip club, all while bordering on legal gray areas. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the quirky, lesser-known Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, while to others, it's a call to embrace the city's unique spirit. Despite a growing number of affluent California transplants and new condo developments, Portland's eccentricity remains. Being weird here doesn't mean embracing everything, but it does mean accepting the unconventional. Modern amenities and controversies coexist, and while we share a reliance on Chinese imports like the rest of the country, Portland is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business types. Perhaps, weirdness here means taking it all with a lighter touch. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features vibrant houses, home gardens, and summer's free boxes, filled with discarded items waiting to be claimed by passersby. These unexpected treasures are what make Portland special to me, one of many weird possibilities. Portland is a melting pot of interests, from goat yoga and soccer matches to dream chasers and bar patrons. Substance abuse and homelessness are also issues, with mental health problems at their root, exacerbated by Portland's wet climate. Social services, while more robust than in many areas, struggle to keep up. Portland's response to homelessness is a tale of empathy and intolerance, a common human struggle.",

            "If you're considering a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll easily find your way there due to its accessible public transportation, which is prevalent throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel immersed in the city's energy.

Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are abundant and popular among locals for their quality food, low prices, and convenience. Nearby, there are multiple Asian supermarkets within walking distance. While the neighborhood is diverse, with immigrants and their offspring, most large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park offering basketball, soccer, baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain. The park's diversity reflects the neighborhood's inclusive atmosphere. Most residential buildings are co-ops or condos, with two-family houses being the majority. While the residents are generally pleasant, noise levels can be high due to frequent car noise. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with the occasional encounter with bullies or thieves. Package theft and dog waste issues are concerns, so being cautious and keeping shoes clean is advisable.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. Everything tends to slope downwards, and my home is positioned at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"workout hill\" due to the frequent joggers who climb it daily. Given the lack of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes and is somewhat treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electric wires are dilapidated and often damaged by storms, which are common in our region. There are many tall pine trees everywhere, but residents dislike them as they block the view of the ocean. Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, boasting large glass facades. Sunsets are stunning, with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, though it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows prolifically on most surfaces, including cars and railings. I once left my car unattended for a month and found it covered in moss. There are few children in the area, but many elderly residents and numerous dogs that roam freely. Rabbits are common, and while cats love hunting them, gardeners dislike them due to their destructive habits. We have a variety of bird species, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks, which are chased off by neighborhood crows. No stores are nearby, but a short walk downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. While there's no significant beach, the rocky shoreline is enjoyable for throwing rocks. The bay is narrow and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. The street where I live serves as a connector between two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, which has allowed me to become familiar with most of my neighbors. They primarily focus on yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down the nearby hill. Our house sits at the corner of our street, giving us a clear view of everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognizing the cars that frequent the area. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in regular walks, either for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on their bikes as one might expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently seen coming and going, and the neighbors have grown accustomed to our routines. We often play outside, sometimes even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck, especially during the pleasant barbecue smell it provides. The neighborhood has many trees, having been originally wooded, which offers ample shade but also an abundance of leaves in the fall that we rake and burn yearly. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves as it signals the arrival of fall. Lately, the winter has been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we use the front door infrequently except when someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, though Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visitors from out of town, with extra cars parked around. Despite the traffic from the through street, I enjoy living here.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Those who haven't lived here might not grasp the unique feeling of constant brown landscapes; a green lawn signifies a significant investment in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were far apart, but now the area has seen new developments while maintaining a similar spacious layout. It's increasingly resembling a city, but that's a common trend in many places. Most people here are friendly, though like any city, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood is peaceful and friendly, with elderly residents, and the stores are chain establishments such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. Specialty stores like Whole Foods are rare, and the dominant local job is construction due to the city's ongoing development. This change worries me; I prefer the current state of my neighborhood. I moved from a big city and dislike the idea of returning. My job involves installing drywall and T-bars in construction sites. I appreciate the varied wildlife in my area. Visitors often come for the desert's stark beauty, and residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist harmoniously. My children adore lizards and desert bugs, and they're often outside trying to catch them. For attractions, Victorville offers a unique desert experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair. Nearby Wrightwood provides snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. For those interested in the high desert's history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I must admit that my experience is quite distinct from the norm. Unlike many others who live in traditional neighborhoods with their own homes and lives, my neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I reside. My immediate community is the dormitory, and the wider neighborhood encompasses the entire campus, although to a lesser degree. Despite this unique situation, my neighborhood shares several characteristics with conventional neighborhoods. It includes housing, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's crucial to outline the types of housing present in my immediate vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory housing. In the apartments, rooms are shared by 2-4 people, with each floor containing 4-6 rooms. On average, a building can house around 20 people. The actual houses available for rent are typically 2-4 bedroom units occupied by alumni, but these are less common. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, with each room accommodating two people, although there are exceptions. With the housing situation covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. It's home to people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, new students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in my neighborhood is challenging without oversimplifying, so let's proceed to the stores and parks. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores include various dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, catering to all needs. The park is a common space for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for about a decade, I'd be happy to share some of my experiences. In the beginning, I was quite unhappy, having moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was initially homesick, but my parents wanted a better life for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered better housing and a better high school. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some acquaintances. I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who live next door. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, threw her garter, which I caught. Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but I've gotten better at navigating it now. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and exploring nature. I enjoy practicing balance and sometimes using my bokken sword at the park. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't used them in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had fun with Mr. Graves. There are many more memories, but these stand out. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "I reside near the college I attend, which I greatly appreciate. The area primarily consists of apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and affordable. One newly renamed bar is a bit pricier but offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is budget-friendly. There's a nearby elementary school, and my apartment is within walking distance. I don't know my neighbors, and I prefer it that way. They seem to smoke a lot of weed, prompting the building management to place an air freshener unit near their door - a somewhat humorous solution. The surrounding buildings are quite old but may have been renovated internally. Down the street, there are newly built apartments that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction and high rent, likely due to their proximity to the campus. Just a few minutes away, I can find an inexpensive restaurant that uses paper plates and serves mostly microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station with questionable employee satisfaction. Recent city funds have improved the road, creating a nice sidewalk and lush greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, including some stumps from recent cuts. The complexes behind my building are less visually appealing, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. The crime rate is higher on the nearby 43rd street, but I still prefer my current residence as it is affordable and offers convenient access to amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out in such a way that they appear as individual homes, with a uniform color scheme of yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most, but not all, neighbors are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not pre-planned driveway to chat as children play nearby. This simple setting feels nostalgic amidst our modern, tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds, our neighborhood is picturesque. The recent tornado warnings have been unsettling; last night, sirens startled us, prompting a rush to safety. I found myself in the bathtub with my youngest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, anxious. After the hailstorm, the road was steaming, the temperature dropping from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail quickly melted on the hot pavement. As the storm cleared, a double rainbow materialized, captivating me and my camera. The neighborhood soon returned to normal, with families going about their evening routines. Recently moved from New Hampshire, I enjoy the southern accents. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is similar to others, although the interiors vary in size. I love walking along the vast field behind my home to the non-swimmable pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs. The sounds of roosters and a donkey nearby make it feel like a small, self-contained village. I consider myself fortunate to have found this charming community near Charlotte.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was beginning eighth grade. Making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually connected with a neighbor who lived two houses down and another on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. The neighborhood's initial inhabitants are still largely present. It's quite similar to any typical American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week. I've had no issues with my neighbors, and I feel safe; no packages have ever been stolen from my porch. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of restaurants nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Many residents now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a park a short walk from my house, where I've played sports and shared memorable experiences with neighbors, including getting a bloody nose playing football. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who enjoy the playground. The park evokes nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is well-stocked with amenities, including dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a grocery store. An Indian-owned store caters to those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood, appreciating it more when I see other people's experiences with neighbors on social media and news.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming, unassuming town in South Carolina. It's not especially notable, but it plays a significant role in the state's agricultural sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with farmland covering expanses of land and housing scattered across it. Houses outside the main town area are typically two stories and have either metal roofs or gray shingles to combat the intense summer heat. They are usually set further back, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The main town area features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the town's only stores. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria operated here previously but has since closed. The town's only pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's only grocery store, although many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store that also offers delivery services. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility. Medical services are provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary office, both located away from the main town area. Johnston Elementary School is the sole educational institution in town for students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While there are no parks or recreational facilities, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or other entertainment venues, but the town is small enough to walk through in a blink of an eye.",
            "The very first time I learned about this place, I was listening to a podcast featuring stories of missing people. It was quite surprising. Nearly all the apartments in the area cost over $1,000 a month, and neither I nor any of my friends had heard of this before. Perhaps it's the struggle. I've seen friends who are so overwhelmed they cry themselves to sleep at night. While things are expensive, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. We grow accustomed to the scent of vintage toys and used clothes, which is a bit less pleasant than when we were younger. Sometimes, we start to smoke or just get used to things. Still, the flea market is a constant presence. The smell of adulthood here is like the dust from old magazines stacked on a closed piano, staying in the leather even after cleaning. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's tranquil. No matter the commotion outside, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Year after year, the area sees more growth. Cars and people fill the streets, and it's said to be a developing city, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is busy pursuing their own goals, and there's little expectation for personal involvement. You can live alone, quietly, and independently, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern is seen as caring. No one pries into others' lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you wish, and the city will coexist with you like waves receding from the shore. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a sense, we don't live among strangers, but rather in a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn, and help one another when needed. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same in return. We pass on each other's mail. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in can be characterized as a standard suburban locale. Homeowner's association rules are particularly evident here, evident in the meticulously kept single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll notice uniform front yards with small grass patches, decorative pebbles, short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every household owns a two-car garage. Throughout the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads in excellent condition, without potholes. Most homes are single-story, but a few are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there's a communal mailbox system at the end of the street, accessible with a key. The neighborhood has a few two-story structures for package deliveries. The location of my house is at the outskirts of the city, making it semi-rural and suburban. There's ample space for various activities, including multiple community pools and walking trails. The area is primarily inhabited by retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is considerable in size but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a mall that's not too large but sufficient. A 15-minute drive offers access to various stores, from high-end groceries to bargain outlets. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-maintained, and typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. While it's not immediately adjacent to any major shopping areas, it's a short car ride away from numerous big-name stores.",
            "I reside in a small town located within the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the eastern side, is often considered the economically underprivileged area of the town. Most residents are either renting or owning their homes due to lower property values. Despite this, it is not an unpleasant environment. My neighbors are generally welcoming and cordial, greeting me warmly when I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly elevated compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, the area has seen a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide within a few blocks of my residence. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not experienced direct crime impacts, only occasional minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families. Despite these challenges, the town offers many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the support team, fostering a positive atmosphere where special needs children, like my son, are well-treated and happy. The PTO organizes various annual events to boost family involvement and educational progress. With over 20% of the population living below the poverty level, the school provides free meals to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Privileges are not withheld based on affordability, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are reasonable. The City Council has made notable improvements to the town’s appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishment. Most enhancements have occurred in the central and western parts, where shopping areas and traffic are concentrated. The eastern side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention among residents. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, schools are exceptional, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home is not highly valued, it is comfortable and meets our needs. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural heritage. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theatre, and a few blocks away is an atmospheric arcade bar where diverse crowds gather on warm summer nights, often forming lines on weekends in June and July. Nearby, there's a spacious city park, though its periphery is lined with concrete and tall stairs. During winter, homeless individuals set up tents along the sidewalk and wide steps, using proximity for warmth despite little snowfall but frequent, intense rainfall. The city's past is still felt, with stories of federal efforts to clean up the neighborhood's notorious gang violence echoing through generations. The people here work hard to maintain a sense of community, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. I find solace in the culture of the people, who, despite the lingering effects of social conditioning and racism, extend kindness and generosity. I've experienced this firsthand, walking those streets at night and receiving unexpected acts of kindness. The Hilltop is home, and its spirit of resilience and community is something I carry with me wherever I go.",
            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From my home, I can venture from agricultural landscapes to small tourist destinations. There are no major city malls, no Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee's within reach. Everything is accessible by car. Yet, I live in one of the most scenic areas, bordering two lakes — Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Every direction offers a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town charm. Houses are not congested and are individually unique, many with full basements visible from the road. Some feature aluminum siding, while others are freshly painted or older, but well-maintained. Most homes have yards, complete with play structures, trampolines, gardens, and fences for pets. The neighborhood reflects the hardworking nature of its residents, who are either raising or have raised families. Daily, you'll see children playing, people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar, with a sense of belonging. Grilling in the backyard and friendly waves are common. The lawns are neatly maintained, with trimmed plants and bushes. The neighborhood is not opulent, but it exudes warmth and safety, making it an ideal place to raise a family. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. You can easily walk or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, being in a large city, is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones housing numerous businesses, such as offices, stores, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, including both international chains and local boutiques. Neighborhoods are often within walking distance of parks where families with young children gather. The people in my area are also diverse, including a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish population, and former Soviet refugees. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is dotted with ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, travel within the city can be challenging due to heavy traffic, with even short distances taking hours during peak times. Most residents prefer to drive, leading to intense congestion and parking difficulties. Despite these challenges, the city has seen significant growth with new apartment buildings being constructed, although this has drawn criticism from current residents. The housing here is varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and various sizes of apartments and condominiums. The community is not very close-knit, and I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, though I recall fond memories from my childhood of playing with nearby friends.",
            "My neighborhood is unique and charming. The majority of homes are single-family dwellings, but some have been divided into two, while maintaining their connection. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a nostalgic feeling of the American dream of suburban living, which once united the country, though nowadays it seems to be fading. However, neighborhoods like mine and many others still stand as a testament to this dream, even if it's no longer as vibrant as it once was. The residents, though maybe not as optimistic as before, still maintain their homes and yards, with cars in almost every driveway and children playing as if the world is their playground. The local school, nearly a century old, still inspires the youth while stirring up memories for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its own character, yet a shared feel of history. There's a large supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide and children often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations, and they share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school now houses a pharmacy, reflecting the changing interests of the youth. An old movie theater, favored by the elderly, shows classic films at discounted prices, drawing fewer youth who prefer newer releases. The nearest expressway is just outside of town, with an exit and entrance in the neighboring town. A petition to bring the expressway to our town was supported by the youth but rejected by the elders, who feared it would ruin their locality. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a southern accent and a log cabin for our town's symbol.",

However, venture past the abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that only operate during peak seasons, and you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged neatly like Russian nesting dolls, side by side. The first set of apartments has made headlines for unsavory incidents, so they won't be the focus, as appearances can be deceiving. The complexes next to them offer a different story, one that's almost unknown to the area's residents.

Retired residents walk their dogs on the path, eyeing teenagers on skateboards and nodding to the girls by the playground. A strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a DIY frozen yogurt shop. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once - and you'll often see teens with sweet, dripping frozen yogurt cups, doing tricks on their skateboards.

            "“Where are we?” she inquired as we passed expansive fields of corn, stretching endlessly to the horizon. “This way!” I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute walk from her home; she'd never witnessed such an extent of unbroken landscape. Taken aback by the omnipresent cornfields, I recounted my upbringing in rural Ohio to her, and in that instant, she understood my origins better. On a two-lane rural road, a water-filled quarry comes into view, followed by my modest subdivision. The homes, mostly brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. In spring, vibrant flowers and the changing foliage of midwestern trees adorn the driveways, where luxury Mercedes-Benzes gleam after a thorough wash. As we draw closer to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always nearby, tending to his lawn while singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Known for his kindness and unique past as a doctor, he’s often seen as a figure of amusement for his antics but loved for his genuine nature. Continuing past him, we arrive at my home.

Around back, a small stream connects to the quarry, providing a symphony of bullfrogs’ croaks, the stream’s flow, and occasional “moos” from neighboring farms. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge, an untouched sanctuary of native trees, herbs, and wildflowers awaits. This was my haven during childhood, filled with forts, imaginary hunts, and endless play opportunities. Winter in my small town can be harsh, yet the barren beauty is unparalleled. Trees shed their vibrant leaves, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland after a snowfall, where snow angels and snowmen dot the backyard. My sister and I would often clash as kids, but during winter, our weapon of choice was snowballs, building massive igloo-like forts with branches. Snowdrifts created our own magical realm, where we engaged in pretend play, free from worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is known for its eccentricity, a fact celebrated by the city's unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" emblazoned on a multi-purpose building housing a pizza shop, bar, music venue, and a strip club, all while bordering on legal gray areas. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the quirky, lesser-known Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, while to others, it's a call to embrace the city's unique spirit. Despite a growing number of affluent California transplants and new condo developments, Portland's eccentricity remains. Being weird here doesn't mean embracing everything, but it does mean accepting the unconventional. Modern amenities and controversies coexist, and while we share a reliance on Chinese imports like the rest of the country, Portland is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business types. Perhaps, weirdness here means taking it all with a lighter touch. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features vibrant houses, home gardens, and summer's free boxes, filled with discarded items waiting to be claimed by passersby. These unexpected treasures are what make Portland special to me, one of many weird possibilities. Portland is a melting pot of interests, from goat yoga and soccer matches to dream chasers and bar patrons. Substance abuse and homelessness are also issues, with mental health problems at their root, exacerbated by Portland's wet climate. Social services, while more robust than in many areas, struggle to keep up. Portland's response to homelessness is a tale of empathy and intolerance, a common human struggle.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel in the north, witnessing the sun's daily dance. Regardless of my distractions or forgetfulness, they remain steadfast and unyielding, unaffected by life's challenges. On days when I'm at my most frazzled, they seize my attention and offer a haven, providing the strength to endure, day by day. I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my initial captivation. While the university and town boast their own charms, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is a mix of bustling city and serene suburbs, with cafes, historic buildings, and parks where cherished memories are made and heartaches are reflected upon. The mountains, however, are the constant, the ever-present reminder of strength and resilience. As I've walked through the town, from the park to the library, and to the main street where the sunrise paints the sky, the mountains have been there, steadfast, inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're considering a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll easily find your way there due to its accessible public transportation, which is prevalent throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel immersed in the city's energy. During your stay, you'll notice numerous Asian stores, as the area has a significant Asian population that has grown over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are abundant and popular among locals for their quality food, low prices, and convenience. Nearby, there are multiple Asian supermarkets within walking distance. While the neighborhood is diverse, with immigrants and their offspring, most large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park offering basketball, soccer, baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain. The park's diversity reflects the neighborhood's inclusive atmosphere. Most residential buildings are co-ops or condos, with two-family houses being the majority. While the residents are generally pleasant, noise levels can be high due to frequent car noise. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with the occasional encounter with bullies or thieves. Package theft and dog waste issues are concerns, so being cautious and keeping shoes clean is advisable.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. Everything tends to slope downwards, and my home is positioned at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"workout hill\" due to the frequent joggers who climb it daily. Given the lack of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes and is somewhat treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electric wires are dilapidated and often damaged by storms, which are common in our region. There are many tall pine trees everywhere, but residents dislike them as they block the view of the ocean. Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, boasting large glass facades. Sunsets are stunning, with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, though it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows prolifically on most surfaces, including cars and railings. I once left my car unattended for a month and found it covered in moss. There are few children in the area, but many elderly residents and numerous dogs that roam freely. Rabbits are common, and while cats love hunting them, gardeners dislike them due to their destructive habits. We have a variety of bird species, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks, which are chased off by neighborhood crows. No stores are nearby, but a short walk downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. While there's no significant beach, the rocky shoreline is enjoyable for throwing rocks. The bay is narrow and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. The street where I live serves as a connector between two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, which has allowed me to become familiar with most of my neighbors. They primarily focus on yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down the nearby hill. Our house sits at the corner of our street, giving us a clear view of everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognizing the cars that frequent the area. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in regular walks, either for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on their bikes as one might expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently seen coming and going, and the neighbors have grown accustomed to our routines. We often play outside, sometimes even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck, especially during the pleasant barbecue smell it provides. The neighborhood has many trees, having been originally wooded, which offers ample shade but also an abundance of leaves in the fall that we rake and burn yearly. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves as it signals the arrival of fall. Lately, the winter has been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we use the front door infrequently except when someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, though Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visitors from out of town, with extra cars parked around. Despite the traffic from the through street, I enjoy living here.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Those who haven't lived here might not grasp the unique feeling of constant brown landscapes; a green lawn signifies a significant investment in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were far apart, but now the area has seen new developments while maintaining a similar spacious layout. It's increasingly resembling a city, but that's a common trend in many places. Most people here are friendly, though like any city, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood is peaceful and friendly, with elderly residents, and the stores are chain establishments such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. Specialty stores like Whole Foods are rare, and the dominant local job is construction due to the city's ongoing development. This change worries me; I prefer the current state of my neighborhood. I moved from a big city and dislike the idea of returning. My job involves installing drywall and T-bars in construction sites. I appreciate the varied wildlife in my area. Visitors often come for the desert's stark beauty, and residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist harmoniously. My children adore lizards and desert bugs, and they're often outside trying to catch them. For attractions, Victorville offers a unique desert experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair. Nearby Wrightwood provides snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. For those interested in the high desert's history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I must admit that my experience is quite distinct from the norm. Unlike many others who live in traditional neighborhoods with their own homes and lives, my neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I reside. My immediate community is the dormitory, and the wider neighborhood encompasses the entire campus, although to a lesser degree. Despite this unique situation, my neighborhood shares several characteristics with conventional neighborhoods. It includes housing, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's crucial to outline the types of housing present in my immediate vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory housing. In the apartments, rooms are shared by 2-4 people, with each floor containing 4-6 rooms. On average, a building can house around 20 people. The actual houses available for rent are typically 2-4 bedroom units occupied by alumni, but these are less common. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, with each room accommodating two people, although there are exceptions. With the housing situation covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. It's home to people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, new students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in my neighborhood is challenging without oversimplifying, so let's proceed to the stores and parks. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores include various dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, catering to all needs. The park is a common space for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for about a decade, I'd be happy to share some of my experiences. In the beginning, I was quite unhappy, having moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was initially homesick, but my parents wanted a better life for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered better housing and a better high school. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some acquaintances. I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who live next door. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, threw her garter, which I caught. Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but I've gotten better at navigating it now. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and exploring nature. I enjoy practicing balance and sometimes using my bokken sword at the park. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't used them in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had fun with Mr. Graves. There are many more memories, but these stand out. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "I reside near the college I attend, which I greatly appreciate. The area primarily consists of apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and affordable. One newly renamed bar is a bit pricier but offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is budget-friendly. There's a nearby elementary school, and my apartment is within walking distance. I don't know my neighbors, and I prefer it that way. They seem to smoke a lot of weed, prompting the building management to place an air freshener unit near their door - a somewhat humorous solution. The surrounding buildings are quite old but may have been renovated internally. Down the street, there are newly built apartments that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction and high rent, likely due to their proximity to the campus. Just a few minutes away, I can find an inexpensive restaurant that uses paper plates and serves mostly microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station with questionable employee satisfaction. Recent city funds have improved the road, creating a nice sidewalk and lush greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, including some stumps from recent cuts. The complexes behind my building are less visually appealing, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. The crime rate is higher on the nearby 43rd street, but I still prefer my current residence as it is affordable and offers convenient access to amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out in such a way that they appear as individual homes, with a uniform color scheme of yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most, but not all, neighbors are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not pre-planned driveway to chat as children play nearby. This simple setting feels nostalgic amidst our modern, tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds, our neighborhood is picturesque. The recent tornado warnings have been unsettling; last night, sirens startled us, prompting a rush to safety. I found myself in the bathtub with my youngest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, anxious. After the hailstorm, the road was steaming, the temperature dropping from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail quickly melted on the hot pavement. As the storm cleared, a double rainbow materialized, captivating me and my camera. The neighborhood soon returned to normal, with families going about their evening routines. Recently moved from New Hampshire, I enjoy the southern accents. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is similar to others, although the interiors vary in size. I love walking along the vast field behind my home to the non-swimmable pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs. The sounds of roosters and a donkey nearby make it feel like a small, self-contained village. I consider myself fortunate to have found this charming community near Charlotte.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was beginning eighth grade. Making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually connected with a neighbor who lived two houses down and another on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. The neighborhood's initial inhabitants are still largely present. It's quite similar to any typical American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week. I've had no issues with my neighbors, and I feel safe; no packages have ever been stolen from my porch. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of restaurants nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Many residents now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a park a short walk from my house, where I've played sports and shared memorable experiences with neighbors, including getting a bloody nose playing football. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who enjoy the playground. The park evokes nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is well-stocked with amenities, including dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a grocery store. An Indian-owned store caters to those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood, appreciating it more when I see other people's experiences with neighbors on social media and news.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming, unassuming town in South Carolina. It's not especially notable, but it plays a significant role in the state's agricultural sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with farmland covering expanses of land and housing scattered across it. Houses outside the main town area are typically two stories and have either metal roofs or gray shingles to combat the intense summer heat. They are usually set further back, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The main town area features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the town's only stores. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria operated here previously but has since closed. The town's only pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's only grocery store, although many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store that also offers delivery services. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility. Medical services are provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary office, both located away from the main town area. Johnston Elementary School is the sole educational institution in town for students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While there are no parks or recreational facilities, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or other entertainment venues, but the town is small enough to walk through in a blink of an eye.",
            "The very first time I learned about this place, I was listening to a podcast featuring stories of missing people. It was quite surprising. Nearly all the apartments in the area cost over $1,000 a month, and neither I nor any of my friends had heard of this before. Perhaps it's the struggle. I've seen friends who are so overwhelmed they cry themselves to sleep at night. While things are expensive, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. We grow accustomed to the scent of vintage toys and used clothes, which is a bit less pleasant than when we were younger. Sometimes, we start to smoke or just get used to things. Still, the flea market is a constant presence. The smell of adulthood here is like the dust from old magazines stacked on a closed piano, staying in the leather even after cleaning. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's tranquil. No matter the commotion outside, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Year after year, the area sees more growth. Cars and people fill the streets, and it's said to be a developing city, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is busy pursuing their own goals, and there's little expectation for personal involvement. You can live alone, quietly, and independently, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern is seen as caring. No one pries into others' lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you wish, and the city will coexist with you like waves receding from the shore. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a sense, we don't live among strangers, but rather in a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn, and help one another when needed. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same in return. We pass on each other's mail. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in can be characterized as a standard suburban locale. Homeowner's association rules are particularly evident here, evident in the meticulously kept single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll notice uniform front yards with small grass patches, decorative pebbles, short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every household owns a two-car garage. Throughout the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads in excellent condition, without potholes. Most homes are single-story, but a few are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there's a communal mailbox system at the end of the street, accessible with a key. The neighborhood has a few two-story structures for package deliveries. The location of my house is at the outskirts of the city, making it semi-rural and suburban. There's ample space for various activities, including multiple community pools and walking trails. The area is primarily inhabited by retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is considerable in size but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a mall that's not too large but sufficient. A 15-minute drive offers access to various stores, from high-end groceries to bargain outlets. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-maintained, and typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. While it's not immediately adjacent to any major shopping areas, it's a short car ride away from numerous big-name stores.",
            "I reside in a small town located within the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the eastern side, is often considered the economically underprivileged area of the town. Most residents are either renting or owning their homes due to lower property values. Despite this, it is not an unpleasant environment. My neighbors are generally welcoming and cordial, greeting me warmly when I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly elevated compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, the area has seen a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide within a few blocks of my residence. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not experienced direct crime impacts, only occasional minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families. Despite these challenges, the town offers many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the support team, fostering a positive atmosphere where special needs children, like my son, are well-treated and happy. The PTO organizes various annual events to boost family involvement and educational progress. With over 20% of the population living below the poverty level, the school provides free meals to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Privileges are not withheld based on affordability, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are reasonable. The City Council has made notable improvements to the town’s appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishment. Most enhancements have occurred in the central and western parts, where shopping areas and traffic are concentrated. The eastern side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention among residents. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, schools are exceptional, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home is not highly valued, it is comfortable and meets our needs. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural heritage. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theatre, and a few blocks away is an atmospheric arcade bar where diverse crowds gather on warm summer nights, often forming lines on weekends in June and July. Nearby, there's a spacious city park, though its periphery is lined with concrete and tall stairs. During winter, homeless individuals set up tents along the sidewalk and wide steps, using proximity for warmth despite little snowfall but frequent, intense rainfall. The city's past is still felt, with stories of federal efforts to clean up the neighborhood's notorious gang violence echoing through generations. The people here work hard to maintain a sense of community, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. I find solace in the culture of the people, who, despite the lingering effects of social conditioning and racism, extend kindness and generosity. I've experienced this firsthand, walking those streets at night and receiving unexpected acts of kindness. The Hilltop is home, and its spirit of resilience and community is something I carry with me wherever I go.",
            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From my home, I can venture from agricultural landscapes to small tourist destinations. There are no major city malls, no Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee's within reach. Everything is accessible by car. Yet, I live in one of the most scenic areas, bordering two lakes — Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Every direction offers a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town charm. Houses are not congested and are individually unique, many with full basements visible from the road. Some feature aluminum siding, while others are freshly painted or older, but well-maintained. Most homes have yards, complete with play structures, trampolines, gardens, and fences for pets. The neighborhood reflects the hardworking nature of its residents, who are either raising or have raised families. Daily, you'll see children playing, people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar, with a sense of belonging. Grilling in the backyard and friendly waves are common. The lawns are neatly maintained, with trimmed plants and bushes. The neighborhood is not opulent, but it exudes warmth and safety, making it an ideal place to raise a family. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. You can easily walk or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, being in a large city, is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones housing numerous businesses, such as offices, stores, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, including both international chains and local boutiques. Neighborhoods are often within walking distance of parks where families with young children gather. The people in my area are also diverse, including a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish population, and former Soviet refugees. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is dotted with ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, travel within the city can be challenging due to heavy traffic, with even short distances taking hours during peak times. Most residents prefer to drive, leading to intense congestion and parking difficulties. Despite these challenges, the city has seen significant growth with new apartment buildings being constructed, although this has drawn criticism from current residents. The housing here is varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and various sizes of apartments and condominiums. The community is not very close-knit, and I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, though I recall fond memories from my childhood of playing with nearby friends.",
            "My neighborhood is unique and charming. The majority of homes are single-family dwellings, but some have been divided into two, while maintaining their connection. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a nostalgic feeling of the American dream of suburban living, which once united the country, though nowadays it seems to be fading. However, neighborhoods like mine and many others still stand as a testament to this dream, even if it's no longer as vibrant as it once was. The residents, though maybe not as optimistic as before, still maintain their homes and yards, with cars in almost every driveway and children playing as if the world is their playground. The local school, nearly a century old, still inspires the youth while stirring up memories for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its own character, yet a shared feel of history. There's a large supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide and children often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations, and they share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school now houses a pharmacy, reflecting the changing interests of the youth. An old movie theater, favored by the elderly, shows classic films at discounted prices, drawing fewer youth who prefer newer releases. The nearest expressway is just outside of town, with an exit and entrance in the neighboring town. A petition to bring the expressway to our town was supported by the youth but rejected by the elders, who feared it would ruin their locality. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a southern accent and a log cabin for our town's symbol.",

However, venture past the abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that only operate during peak seasons, and you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged neatly like Russian nesting dolls, side by side. The first set of apartments has made headlines for unsavory incidents, so they won't be the focus, as appearances can be deceiving. The complexes next to them offer a different story, one that's almost unknown to the area's residents.

Retired residents walk their dogs on the path, eyeing teenagers on skateboards and nodding to the girls by the playground. A strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a DIY frozen yogurt shop. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once - and you'll often see teens with sweet, dripping frozen yogurt cups, doing tricks on their skateboards.

            "“Where are we?” she inquired as we passed expansive fields of corn, stretching endlessly to the horizon. “This way!” I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute walk from her home; she'd never witnessed such an extent of unbroken landscape. Taken aback by the omnipresent cornfields, I recounted my upbringing in rural Ohio to her, and in that instant, she understood my origins better. On a two-lane rural road, a water-filled quarry comes into view, followed by my modest subdivision. The homes, mostly brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. In spring, vibrant flowers and the changing foliage of midwestern trees adorn the driveways, where luxury Mercedes-Benzes gleam after a thorough wash. As we draw closer to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always nearby, tending to his lawn while singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Known for his kindness and unique past as a doctor, he’s often seen as a figure of amusement for his antics but loved for his genuine nature. Continuing past him, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound, chased by our Terrier. Around back, a small stream connects to the quarry, providing a symphony of bullfrogs’ croaks, the stream’s flow, and occasional “moos” from neighboring farms. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge, an untouched sanctuary of native trees, herbs, and wildflowers awaits. This was my haven during childhood, filled with forts, imaginary hunts, and endless play opportunities. Winter in my small town can be harsh, yet the barren beauty is unparalleled. Trees shed their vibrant leaves, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland after a snowfall, where snow angels and snowmen dot the backyard. My sister and I would often clash as kids, but during winter, our weapon of choice was snowballs, building massive igloo-like forts with branches. Snowdrifts created our own magical realm, where we engaged in pretend play, free from worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is known for its eccentricity, a fact celebrated by the city's unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" emblazoned on a multi-purpose building housing a pizza shop, bar, music venue, and a strip club, all while bordering on legal gray areas. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the quirky, lesser-known Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, while to others, it's a call to embrace the city's unique spirit. Despite a growing number of affluent California transplants and new condo developments, Portland's eccentricity remains. Being weird here doesn't mean embracing everything, but it does mean accepting the unconventional. Modern amenities and controversies coexist, and while we share a reliance on Chinese imports like the rest of the country, Portland is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business types. Perhaps, weirdness here means taking it all with a lighter touch. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features vibrant houses, home gardens, and summer's free boxes, filled with discarded items waiting to be claimed by passersby. These unexpected treasures are what make Portland special to me, one of many weird possibilities. Portland is a melting pot of interests, from goat yoga and soccer matches to dream chasers and bar patrons. Substance abuse and homelessness are also issues, with mental health problems at their root, exacerbated by Portland's wet climate. Social services, while more robust than in many areas, struggle to keep up. Portland's response to homelessness is a tale of empathy and intolerance, a common human struggle.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel in the north, witnessing the sun's daily dance. Regardless of my distractions or forgetfulness, they remain steadfast and unyielding, unaffected by life's challenges. On days when I'm at my most frazzled, they seize my attention and offer a haven, providing the strength to endure, day by day. I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my initial captivation. While the university and town boast their own charms, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is a mix of bustling city and serene suburbs, with cafes, historic buildings, and parks where cherished memories are made and heartaches are reflected upon. The mountains, however, are the constant, the ever-present reminder of strength and resilience. As I've walked through the town, from the park to the library, and to the main street where the sunrise paints the sky, the mountains have been there, steadfast, inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're considering a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll easily find your way there due to its accessible public transportation, which is prevalent throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel immersed in the city's energy. During your stay, you'll notice numerous Asian stores, as the area has a significant Asian population that has grown over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are abundant and popular among locals for their quality food, low prices, and convenience. Nearby, there are multiple Asian supermarkets within walking distance. While the neighborhood is diverse, with immigrants and their offspring, most large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park offering basketball, soccer, baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain. The park's diversity reflects the neighborhood's inclusive atmosphere. Most residential buildings are co-ops or condos, with two-family houses being the majority. While the residents are generally pleasant, noise levels can be high due to frequent car noise. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with the occasional encounter with bullies or thieves. Package theft and dog waste issues are concerns, so being cautious and keeping shoes clean is advisable.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. Everything tends to slope downwards, and my home is positioned at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"workout hill\" due to the frequent joggers who climb it daily. Given the lack of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes and is somewhat treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electric wires are dilapidated and often damaged by storms, which are common in our region. There are many tall pine trees everywhere, but residents dislike them as they block the view of the ocean. Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, boasting large glass facades. Sunsets are stunning, with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, though it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows prolifically on most surfaces, including cars and railings. I once left my car unattended for a month and found it covered in moss. There are few children in the area, but many elderly residents and numerous dogs that roam freely. Rabbits are common, and while cats love hunting them, gardeners dislike them due to their destructive habits. We have a variety of bird species, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks, which are chased off by neighborhood crows. No stores are nearby, but a short walk downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. While there's no significant beach, the rocky shoreline is enjoyable for throwing rocks. The bay is narrow and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. The street where I live serves as a connector between two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, which has allowed me to become familiar with most of my neighbors. They primarily focus on yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down the nearby hill. Our house sits at the corner of our street, giving us a clear view of everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognizing the cars that frequent the area. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in regular walks, either for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on their bikes as one might expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently seen coming and going, and the neighbors have grown accustomed to our routines. We often play outside, sometimes even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck, especially during the pleasant barbecue smell it provides. The neighborhood has many trees, having been originally wooded, which offers ample shade but also an abundance of leaves in the fall that we rake and burn yearly. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves as it signals the arrival of fall. Lately, the winter has been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we use the front door infrequently except when someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, though Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visitors from out of town, with extra cars parked around. Despite the traffic from the through street, I enjoy living here.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Those who haven't lived here might not grasp the unique feeling of constant brown landscapes; a green lawn signifies a significant investment in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were far apart, but now the area has seen new developments while maintaining a similar spacious layout. It's increasingly resembling a city, but that's a common trend in many places. Most people here are friendly, though like any city, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood is peaceful and friendly, with elderly residents, and the stores are chain establishments such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. Specialty stores like Whole Foods are rare, and the dominant local job is construction due to the city's ongoing development. This change worries me; I prefer the current state of my neighborhood. I moved from a big city and dislike the idea of returning. My job involves installing drywall and T-bars in construction sites. I appreciate the varied wildlife in my area. Visitors often come for the desert's stark beauty, and residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist harmoniously. My children adore lizards and desert bugs, and they're often outside trying to catch them. For attractions, Victorville offers a unique desert experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair. Nearby Wrightwood provides snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. For those interested in the high desert's history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I must admit that my experience is quite distinct from the norm. Unlike many others who live in traditional neighborhoods with their own homes and lives, my neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I reside. My immediate community is the dormitory, and the wider neighborhood encompasses the entire campus, although to a lesser degree. Despite this unique situation, my neighborhood shares several characteristics with conventional neighborhoods. It includes housing, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's crucial to outline the types of housing present in my immediate vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory housing. In the apartments, rooms are shared by 2-4 people, with each floor containing 4-6 rooms. On average, a building can house around 20 people. The actual houses available for rent are typically 2-4 bedroom units occupied by alumni, but these are less common. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, with each room accommodating two people, although there are exceptions. With the housing situation covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. It's home to people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, new students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in my neighborhood is challenging without oversimplifying, so let's proceed to the stores and parks. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores include various dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, catering to all needs. The park is a common space for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for about a decade, I'd be happy to share some of my experiences. In the beginning, I was quite unhappy, having moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was initially homesick, but my parents wanted a better life for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered better housing and a better high school. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some acquaintances. I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who live next door. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, threw her garter, which I caught. Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but I've gotten better at navigating it now. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and exploring nature. I enjoy practicing balance and sometimes using my bokken sword at the park. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't used them in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had fun with Mr. Graves. There are many more memories, but these stand out. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "I reside near the college I attend, which I greatly appreciate. The area primarily consists of apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and affordable. One newly renamed bar is a bit pricier but offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is budget-friendly. There's a nearby elementary school, and my apartment is within walking distance. I don't know my neighbors, and I prefer it that way. They seem to smoke a lot of weed, prompting the building management to place an air freshener unit near their door - a somewhat humorous solution. The surrounding buildings are quite old but may have been renovated internally. Down the street, there are newly built apartments that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction and high rent, likely due to their proximity to the campus. Just a few minutes away, I can find an inexpensive restaurant that uses paper plates and serves mostly microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station with questionable employee satisfaction. Recent city funds have improved the road, creating a nice sidewalk and lush greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, including some stumps from recent cuts. The complexes behind my building are less visually appealing, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. The crime rate is higher on the nearby 43rd street, but I still prefer my current residence as it is affordable and offers convenient access to amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out in such a way that they appear as individual homes, with a uniform color scheme of yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most, but not all, neighbors are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not pre-planned driveway to chat as children play nearby. This simple setting feels nostalgic amidst our modern, tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds, our neighborhood is picturesque. The recent tornado warnings have been unsettling; last night, sirens startled us, prompting a rush to safety. I found myself in the bathtub with my youngest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, anxious. After the hailstorm, the road was steaming, the temperature dropping from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail quickly melted on the hot pavement. As the storm cleared, a double rainbow materialized, captivating me and my camera. The neighborhood soon returned to normal, with families going about their evening routines. Recently moved from New Hampshire, I enjoy the southern accents. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is similar to others, although the interiors vary in size. I love walking along the vast field behind my home to the non-swimmable pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs. The sounds of roosters and a donkey nearby make it feel like a small, self-contained village. I consider myself fortunate to have found this charming community near Charlotte.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was beginning eighth grade. Making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually connected with a neighbor who lived two houses down and another on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. The neighborhood's initial inhabitants are still largely present. It's quite similar to any typical American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week. I've had no issues with my neighbors, and I feel safe; no packages have ever been stolen from my porch. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of restaurants nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Many residents now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a park a short walk from my house, where I've played sports and shared memorable experiences with neighbors, including getting a bloody nose playing football. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who enjoy the playground. The park evokes nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is well-stocked with amenities, including dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a grocery store. An Indian-owned store caters to those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood, appreciating it more when I see other people's experiences with neighbors on social media and news.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming, unassuming town in South Carolina. It's not especially notable, but it plays a significant role in the state's agricultural sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with farmland covering expanses of land and housing scattered across it. Houses outside the main town area are typically two stories and have either metal roofs or gray shingles to combat the intense summer heat. They are usually set further back, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The main town area features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the town's only stores. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria operated here previously but has since closed. The town's only pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's only grocery store, although many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store that also offers delivery services. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility. Medical services are provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary office, both located away from the main town area. Johnston Elementary School is the sole educational institution in town for students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While there are no parks or recreational facilities, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or other entertainment venues, but the town is small enough to walk through in a blink of an eye.",
            "The very first time I learned about this place, I was listening to a podcast featuring stories of missing people. It was quite surprising. Nearly all the apartments in the area cost over $1,000 a month, and neither I nor any of my friends had heard of this before. Perhaps it's the struggle. I've seen friends who are so overwhelmed they cry themselves to sleep at night. While things are expensive, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. We grow accustomed to the scent of vintage toys and used clothes, which is a bit less pleasant than when we were younger. Sometimes, we start to smoke or just get used to things. Still, the flea market is a constant presence. The smell of adulthood here is like the dust from old magazines stacked on a closed piano, staying in the leather even after cleaning. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's tranquil. No matter the commotion outside, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Year after year, the area sees more growth. Cars and people fill the streets, and it's said to be a developing city, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is busy pursuing their own goals, and there's little expectation for personal involvement. You can live alone, quietly, and independently, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern is seen as caring. No one pries into others' lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you wish, and the city will coexist with you like waves receding from the shore. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a sense, we don't live among strangers, but rather in a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn, and help one another when needed. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same in return. We pass on each other's mail. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in can be characterized as a standard suburban locale. Homeowner's association rules are particularly evident here, evident in the meticulously kept single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll notice uniform front yards with small grass patches, decorative pebbles, short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every household owns a two-car garage. Throughout the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads in excellent condition, without potholes. Most homes are single-story, but a few are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there's a communal mailbox system at the end of the street, accessible with a key. The neighborhood has a few two-story structures for package deliveries. The location of my house is at the outskirts of the city, making it semi-rural and suburban. There's ample space for various activities, including multiple community pools and walking trails. The area is primarily inhabited by retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is considerable in size but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a mall that's not too large but sufficient. A 15-minute drive offers access to various stores, from high-end groceries to bargain outlets. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-maintained, and typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. While it's not immediately adjacent to any major shopping areas, it's a short car ride away from numerous big-name stores.",
            "I reside in a small town located within the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the eastern side, is often considered the economically underprivileged area of the town. Most residents are either renting or owning their homes due to lower property values. Despite this, it is not an unpleasant environment. My neighbors are generally welcoming and cordial, greeting me warmly when I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly elevated compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, the area has seen a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide within a few blocks of my residence. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not experienced direct crime impacts, only occasional minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families. Despite these challenges, the town offers many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the support team, fostering a positive atmosphere where special needs children, like my son, are well-treated and happy. The PTO organizes various annual events to boost family involvement and educational progress. With over 20% of the population living below the poverty level, the school provides free meals to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Privileges are not withheld based on affordability, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are reasonable. The City Council has made notable improvements to the town’s appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishment. Most enhancements have occurred in the central and western parts, where shopping areas and traffic are concentrated. The eastern side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention among residents. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, schools are exceptional, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home is not highly valued, it is comfortable and meets our needs. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural heritage. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theatre, and a few blocks away is an atmospheric arcade bar where diverse crowds gather on warm summer nights, often forming lines on weekends in June and July. Nearby, there's a spacious city park, though its periphery is lined with concrete and tall stairs. During winter, homeless individuals set up tents along the sidewalk and wide steps, using proximity for warmth despite little snowfall but frequent, intense rainfall. The city's past is still felt, with stories of federal efforts to clean up the neighborhood's notorious gang violence echoing through generations. The people here work hard to maintain a sense of community, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. I find solace in the culture of the people, who, despite the lingering effects of social conditioning and racism, extend kindness and generosity. I've experienced this firsthand, walking those streets at night and receiving unexpected acts of kindness. The Hilltop is home, and its spirit of resilience and community is something I carry with me wherever I go.",
            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From my home, I can venture from agricultural landscapes to small tourist destinations. There are no major city malls, no Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee's within reach. Everything is accessible by car. Yet, I live in one of the most scenic areas, bordering two lakes — Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Every direction offers a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town charm. Houses are not congested and are individually unique, many with full basements visible from the road. Some feature aluminum siding, while others are freshly painted or older, but well-maintained. Most homes have yards, complete with play structures, trampolines, gardens, and fences for pets. The neighborhood reflects the hardworking nature of its residents, who are either raising or have raised families. Daily, you'll see children playing, people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar, with a sense of belonging. Grilling in the backyard and friendly waves are common. The lawns are neatly maintained, with trimmed plants and bushes. The neighborhood is not opulent, but it exudes warmth and safety, making it an ideal place to raise a family. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. You can easily walk or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."
