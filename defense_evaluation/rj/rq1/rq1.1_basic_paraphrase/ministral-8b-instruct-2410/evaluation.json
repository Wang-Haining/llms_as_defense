            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Despite the closeness, traffic is notorious, with 10-mile commutes sometimes taking hours, especially during peak times. Most residents depend on cars, and parking is a challenge. Recently, the city has seen extensive construction, adding more high-rise apartments, which has both increased its appeal and stirred resident concerns about overcrowding and worsening traffic.\n\nHousing here is varied, with a mix of standalone homes, duplexes, and small apartment buildings.

            "My neighborhood is distinctive. It features a mix of standalone single-family residences and a few houses that have been subdivided into two units while still attached. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a past era when living in the suburbs was the quintessential American dream. Although this dream has somewhat faded, many neighborhoods like mine persist, still embodying that dream and clinging to it. Residents are less optimistic than they once were, yard maintenance has declined, but cars are still in driveways, and youth continue to play as if the world is their playground. The long-standing public school, nearly a century old, continues to inspire future generations while stirring nostalgia in older residents. Church attendance is sparse, but basketball courts remain full. Homes vary in appearance but share a sense of familiarity. Super \"A\" supermarket, owned by a large Yemeni family, is likely the only Arab-owned business in the neighborhood, where the majority of residents are African American. The wide streets are often filled with children playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Most residents have deep roots in the community, with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, influenced by Hollywood, is now a pharmacy. An old movie theater, showing discounted classic films, attracts seniors who appreciate the quiet atmosphere. A single expressway runs through our town, with entrances and exits in a neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was denied by elders who feared it would alter the neighborhood.

            "Portland, Oregon, is famously known for its eccentricity, encapsulated by its unofficial motto \"Keep Portland Weird\". This phrase is a nod to the city's past, when it was less renowned and less pricey, fostering unique, creative subcultures. To some, it's an invitation to embrace a place where people find being weird as a compliment. Despite gentrification and the influx of wealthy newcomers, Portland retains its quirkiness. Being weird in Portland means accepting the unusual, not necessarily being always accepting. The city enjoys modern amenities and issues, like most places, but with a lighter touch. Portland is home to a mix of yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and professionals, as well as colorful houses with herb and vegetable gardens in the streets. The city's peculiarity is highlighted by \"free boxes\", which can contain discarded items like clothes and books. The magic of finding such treasures in Southeast Portland neighborhoods embodies what Portland means to many. However, Portland faces challenges like drug abuse, homelessness, and mental health issues, with some residents expressing care or disdain towards both the homeless and the city's drug problem. In this, Portland shares commonalities with other places.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, overlooking the sunrise and sunset each day, regardless of whether I remember them or not. Their presence remains constant, unaffected by life's ups and downs. Even during stressful times, they beckon me to pause and find solace, offering me the strength to endure. I first noticed them when I began my undergraduate studies. While the university and town have their own attractions, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself offers a blend of old and new, with charming cafes and bustling streets, and a serene atmosphere that makes it feel both suburban and urban. It's in these various settings that I've formed cherished memories, from late-night study sessions to movie nights. However, the town is not without its challenges, and the ponds, in particular, have been a place of both reflection and tears. As I watched the pond's inhabitants, I pondered my own sense of purpose. I wandered through the town, eventually reaching a main street where the sun painted the sky with its rays. At that moment, I realized I was heading north, and there they were—those unyielding mountains that have always been there, inspiring my resolve to keep going, one day at a time.",

            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. The street I live on connects two state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet community. There's not much turnover in residents, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They spend their time on yard work and chores. In winter, we sled down the street's hill. Our house is at the front corner, so we see all the comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars on the street. We notice any unusual vehicles. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children often ride bikes and engage in typical suburban activities. As a family of four – my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen – we work from home, so we're a regular sight in the neighborhood. We enjoy playing and grilling outside, even in the rain. From March to October, we frequently hear lawn mowers due to the abundant trees that provide shade and annual leaf raking and burning. I like the smell of the burning leaves, which signals the onset of fall. Recently, winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I often work in the garage on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, it's quiet until visiting families arrive, resulting in extra cars parked on the street. Overall, I enjoy living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a thoroughfare.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant view of brown landscapes and the extravagant care required to maintain a lush lawn. In the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but now there are many new additions, making it look increasingly like a city. While people are generally friendly, every city has its good and bad parts. My neighborhood is predominantly inhabited by friendly seniors, making it a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chain retailers, with few independent or specialty shops. The most common jobs are in construction, which is due to the city's ongoing development. I'm concerned about the extensive building, as I enjoy the existing layout. I left a busy city and prefer this slower pace. My full-time job is in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the attractions of living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain support various ecosystems and species, requiring residents to learn about and respect these non-human inhabitants. My family has adapted well to our surroundings; my children are particularly fond of lizards and desert bugs. For attractions, the San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville offers a fun family experience. Additionally, Wrightwood nearby provides a snowy mountain backdrop for winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's geological, archaeological, and historical artifacts, giving insight into the high desert's development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, my response might be unique. Unlike many who have their own homes, I live in a dormitory within a college campus. The people living around me form my community, and while the surrounding campus is considered my neighborhood, it's less prominent. Despite this unique context, my neighborhood shares common elements with traditional ones, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's explore the \"houses\" first. There are three types of housing in my immediate area: apartments, houses, and dormitories. Apartments usually house 2-4 people per room, with several rooms on each floor and a few floors per building, accommodating around 20 people on average. Actual houses are available for school-affiliated renters, often alumni, but they are fewer in number. Dormitories are the most common, with hundreds of students sharing rooms. Now, regarding the people, my campus is known for its diversity, which is evident in my neighborhood. Various cultures and ages are represented, with staff living in houses, newer students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. The neighborhood also offers a variety of stores and a park. The stores include dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, ensuring that all needs can be met within the neighborhood. The park is a communal space kept clean and safe by the community itself.",
            "Having been here for roughly a decade, I feel I'm well-versed enough to share some insights. Initially, I was disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough goodbye, but my parents wanted better opportunities for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood was considered upgrading in terms of housing and schooling. It took time to adapt, but I made friends and a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, who live next door, and Dennis, who we were close with. Mr. Glen and his re-marriage to Ms. Veda was a highlight. I caught her garter but missed her bouquet! That night was filled with dancing and fun, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I'm exploring more. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life's simple pleasures. Nature at the park calms me, and I practice my balance with sticks and a bokken wooden sword. The basketball and tennis courts, though underused, are a fun reminder of my dad's coaching with Mr. Graves. There's a lot of good memories and many more to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college I attend, which I find very convenient. The area is predominantly residential, with a few restaurants and bars scattered about, many of which are reasonably priced. One of the bars underwent a name change and has a higher price point, but the service and drinks are still quite good. The neighborhood residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly students and lower-income individuals due to the affordability of the housing. There's an elementary school nearby, and the neighborhood is family-friendly. I don't know my neighbors, which suits me just fine. They often smoke weed, leading the building management to install an air freshener outside their door, an amusing but somewhat disrespectful gesture. The buildings around me are mostly older but may have been recently renovated. Newer apartment buildings nearby lack quality construction, yet command high rents due to their campus proximity. There's an affordable restaurant a short walk away that serves food on paper plates and primarily uses microwaves. Across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. Thanks to city funds, the road underwent renovations last summer, improving the overall aesthetics of the area. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, although some were recently removed, leaving stumps. Behind my complex, there's a row of apartments and a tree line. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind me, which is less desirable due to poor sidewalk conditions and dilapidated buildings. There's plenty of greenery, possibly to conceal the buildings' state. Crime is an issue in the neighborhood, with incidents occurring at nearby apartment complexes. While the area has its drawbacks, I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the college and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is composed of duplexes arranged in a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses. The only distinguishing feature is their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. We often gather at the end of a shared driveway in the evenings, chatting while the kids play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I ended up in my bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the temperature drop from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. Then, the sun came out and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera to share the sight with my Facebook friends and family. The streets were quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Then, life resumed as usual, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. This neighborhood is a gem, especially for this New Hampshire transplant who loves the southern accents. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most residents. While the houses look the same externally, interiors vary in size. I enjoy walking through the largest field behind my home to the pond, where I've spotted deer and heard giant bullfrogs in the morning. Living forty minutes from Charlotte is like being in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that braying in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood right before I began eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually connected with someone living two houses down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still present. This neighborhood is typical of an average American suburb, filled with two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing outside is common. Most days are quiet, and I've never had issues with any neighbors. I feel secure in this neighborhood, having never experienced any package thefts from my porch. I can trust my neighbors. There's a park nearby where I have cherished memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood kids. Although I once got elbowed in the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's young children. The park evokes nostalgia in me for various reasons. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, all within a one-mile radius. Residents often use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Most popular food places are fast food chains, which are common in suburban areas. There are numerous stores offering everything one might need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and unique ethnic stores like an Indian-owned shop for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm happy with my neighborhood. Reading about other people's experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a cozy little town in South Carolina that blends in with others but plays a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely made up of farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle ranches dominating the landscape. Houses outside the main town are spaced far apart, typically two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs designed to withstand the scorching summer heat. These homes are usually set back from the road, with the front fields used for farming or livestock. The main part of town features a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the few stores located in the town are situated. These include Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, Gary's, a small burger chain, and Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and expensive, with many residents preferring to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which offers a wide range of everyday items and remains busy throughout the day. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a community-renowned woman and employs movers to deliver furniture. Attached to the store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding services. Both a medical clinic and veterinary practice are located away from the town center, serving the town's residents. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students must travel to the next town. The town lacks parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed. Despite its limited amenities, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might miss it in a blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about this place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was unexpected, as nearly every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard any news about this before, and neither had my friends. It seems to be a common struggle. Some of my friends struggle financially and have to be frugal. Over time, we've adapted and started to appreciate the dusty scent of thrift store treasures and vintage clothing. Adulthood brings with it a certain smell, including the scent of dusty old magazines in a closed piano that lingers even after cleaning. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every day, but the stores remain quiet. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. Year by year, the city is growing, with more people and vehicles. It's similar to New York, where everyone is focused on their own pursuits, and there's little expectation for interaction. People here don't pry into each other's lives, and you can maintain your privacy as long as you want. The city just keeps moving, like waves on the beach. Despite living in a large, impersonal cityscape, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't entirely made a mistake in choosing to live here. They're a community of friends who gather for various events, assist each other when needed, and generally treat each other well. I like most of them, and they seem to enjoy my company as well. It's people like my neighbors that make this place feel like home.",
            "The area where I live is typical of suburban neighborhoods, characterized by its cookie-cutter feel. A homeowner's association is clearly active here, ensuring that all the homes are well-maintained. Each house is a single-family residence with a similar layout: a small yard with landscaping, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are recently paved, with no potholes, and most houses are single-story, although some are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there are communal mailbox banks and lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. It offers several community pools and walking trails, and is mostly populated by retirees, with a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. There's a single mall nearby, offering a range of stores from high-end to bargain outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the nearest significant destination. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of recreational facilities, and while it's not close to major shopping centers, they are easily accessible by car.",
            "I reside in a small town located just outside the suburbs of a major city, in the Midwest. My immediate neighborhood on the east side is our town's most economically challenged area, with low property values and predominantly low-income residents. While not unpleasant, the area is often overlooked in terms of development. My neighbors are generally welcoming, and the crime rate, while slightly higher than other parts of town, is still relatively low. Some violent crimes have occurred nearby, including shootings and a homicide in recent years. Our neighboring family lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has only been affected by minor issues like items vanishing from our porch. The community has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this, including addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions. Our town boasts excellent schools with supportive staff, including my son's elementary school, which is particularly inclusive and positive. The PTO organizes events to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students to prevent hunger. The City Council has improved the town's appearance, mainly focusing on the center and west side, where most shopping and traffic are concentrated. This has led to some neglect on the east side, where my family lives. Despite these challenges, we enjoy our town as it meets our family's needs and offers a comfortable and adequate home. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It's situated on a hill and surrounded by historic structures. I live in a 7-story apartment building opposite an old theater and a few blocks away is a popular summertime arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd. On weekends in June and July, the line to get in can be quite long. Nearby is a sizable city park. Despite the area, it's well-maintained, with concrete paths and tall stairs. During winter, homeless people set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and steps, a strategy to stay warmer together despite the rain and lack of snow. What I appreciate about my city isn't just its historic architecture but the resilience and community spirit of its people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still carries echoes of its past. Despite ongoing efforts to clean it up, it's considered one of the tougher neighborhoods. Even so, people here care deeply about their community and each other. There's a warning to avoid walking the streets at night if you're white, a remnant of old prejudices. I feel a sense of belonging here, where people have offered me kindness rather than threat. It's a place where a laundromat stayed open late to charge my phone and where I've received unexpected acts of kindness.",
            "I reside in rural Michigan, a small town nestled between expansive farmlands and tourist cities. There aren't any major retail outlets like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's, and everything necessitates a drive. Despite this, my location is picturesque, surrounded by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches nearby for a refreshing dip. The neighborhood reflects a typical small-town atmosphere, featuring non-identical, older homes with full basements and diverse yard features like trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences. It's a community where neighbors are familiar with one another, and houses are well-maintained with open, inviting porches. The area is quiet, peaceful, and safe, with local services like the sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center nearby. The neighborhood has baseball and softball fields, a small airport, a nearby ice cream shop, and a park within cycling distance. It's a great place to live and raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Despite the closeness, traffic is notorious, with 10-mile commutes sometimes taking hours, especially during peak times. Most residents depend on cars, and parking is a challenge. Recently, the city has seen extensive construction, adding more high-rise apartments, which has both increased its appeal and stirred resident concerns about overcrowding and worsening traffic.\n\nHousing here is varied, with a mix of standalone homes, duplexes, and small apartment buildings.

            "My neighborhood is distinctive. It features a mix of standalone single-family residences and a few houses that have been subdivided into two units while still attached. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a past era when living in the suburbs was the quintessential American dream. Although this dream has somewhat faded, many neighborhoods like mine persist, still embodying that dream and clinging to it. Residents are less optimistic than they once were, yard maintenance has declined, but cars are still in driveways, and youth continue to play as if the world is their playground. The long-standing public school, nearly a century old, continues to inspire future generations while stirring nostalgia in older residents. Church attendance is sparse, but basketball courts remain full. Homes vary in appearance but share a sense of familiarity. Super \"A\" supermarket, owned by a large Yemeni family, is likely the only Arab-owned business in the neighborhood, where the majority of residents are African American. The wide streets are often filled with children playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Most residents have deep roots in the community, with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, influenced by Hollywood, is now a pharmacy. An old movie theater, showing discounted classic films, attracts seniors who appreciate the quiet atmosphere. A single expressway runs through our town, with entrances and exits in a neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was denied by elders who feared it would alter the neighborhood.

            "“Where is everything?” she wondered aloud as we passed the sprawling cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is amazing!” I exclaimed, knowing she’d be taken aback by the vast emptiness. She hailed from a city where the nearest grocery store was just a short walk from her doorstep—she’d never encountered such openness before.

            "Portland, Oregon, is famously known for its eccentricity, encapsulated by its unofficial motto \"Keep Portland Weird\". This phrase is a nod to the city's past, when it was less renowned and less pricey, fostering unique, creative subcultures. To some, it's an invitation to embrace a place where people find being weird as a compliment. Despite gentrification and the influx of wealthy newcomers, Portland retains its quirkiness. Being weird in Portland means accepting the unusual, not necessarily being always accepting. The city enjoys modern amenities and issues, like most places, but with a lighter touch. Portland is home to a mix of yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and professionals, as well as colorful houses with herb and vegetable gardens in the streets. The city's peculiarity is highlighted by \"free boxes\", which can contain discarded items like clothes and books. The magic of finding such treasures in Southeast Portland neighborhoods embodies what Portland means to many. However, Portland faces challenges like drug abuse, homelessness, and mental health issues, with some residents expressing care or disdain towards both the homeless and the city's drug problem. In this, Portland shares commonalities with other places.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, overlooking the sunrise and sunset each day, regardless of whether I remember them or not. Their presence remains constant, unaffected by life's ups and downs. Even during stressful times, they beckon me to pause and find solace, offering me the strength to endure. I first noticed them when I began my undergraduate studies. While the university and town have their own attractions, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself offers a blend of old and new, with charming cafes and bustling streets, and a serene atmosphere that makes it feel both suburban and urban. It's in these various settings that I've formed cherished memories, from late-night study sessions to movie nights. However, the town is not without its challenges, and the ponds, in particular, have been a place of both reflection and tears. As I watched the pond's inhabitants, I pondered my own sense of purpose. I wandered through the town, eventually reaching a main street where the sun painted the sky with its rays. At that moment, I realized I was heading north, and there they were—those unyielding mountains that have always been there, inspiring my resolve to keep going, one day at a time.",

This urban neighborhood maintains the city's energy, with Asian stores prevalent due to the influx of Asian residents over the past two decades. Expect to see Asian-owned supermarkets and laundromats every few blocks, offering quality products at affordable prices. Diverse communities coexist here, with first and second-generation American children of immigrants living alongside one another. The area boasts a recently renovated park with basketball and handball courts, a large field for sports, swings, a playground, and a water fountain, showcasing the neighborhood's diversity. Most residential buildings are co-op apartments or two-family houses, with a few condominiums. While the community is generally friendly, nighttime safety is a concern due to unpredictable individuals, occasional package theft, and unkempt streets. Be cautious during your visit.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce and the terrain is hilly, with my house positioned at the highest point. Locals refer to it as the \"workout hill\" due to the frequent joggers. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk on the road, which can be uneven and dangerous. Power lines around the area are often damaged and repaired haphazardly, and there are many tall evergreen trees that obstruct views of the ocean. Despite this, the sunsets are breathtaking, though it's usually cloudy. The environment is damp, and moss grows abundantly on surfaces. Children are rare, as are stores, with the nearest food options being a few restaurants by the waterfront. The bay is narrow and the shoreline offers no beach, but the rocks make for enjoyable rock-throwing. The neighborhood is populated mainly by seniors and their dogs, with rabbits and various birds being common sights, though hawks are chased off by crows.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. The street I live on connects two state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet community. There's not much turnover in residents, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They spend their time on yard work and chores. In winter, we sled down the street's hill. Our house is at the front corner, so we see all the comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars on the street. We notice any unusual vehicles. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children often ride bikes and engage in typical suburban activities. As a family of four – my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen – we work from home, so we're a regular sight in the neighborhood. We enjoy playing and grilling outside, even in the rain. From March to October, we frequently hear lawn mowers due to the abundant trees that provide shade and annual leaf raking and burning. I like the smell of the burning leaves, which signals the onset of fall. Recently, winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I often work in the garage on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, it's quiet until visiting families arrive, resulting in extra cars parked on the street. Overall, I enjoy living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a thoroughfare.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant view of brown landscapes and the extravagant care required to maintain a lush lawn. In the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but now there are many new additions, making it look increasingly like a city. While people are generally friendly, every city has its good and bad parts. My neighborhood is predominantly inhabited by friendly seniors, making it a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chain retailers, with few independent or specialty shops. The most common jobs are in construction, which is due to the city's ongoing development. I'm concerned about the extensive building, as I enjoy the existing layout. I left a busy city and prefer this slower pace. My full-time job is in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the attractions of living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain support various ecosystems and species, requiring residents to learn about and respect these non-human inhabitants. My family has adapted well to our surroundings; my children are particularly fond of lizards and desert bugs. For attractions, the San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville offers a fun family experience. Additionally, Wrightwood nearby provides a snowy mountain backdrop for winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's geological, archaeological, and historical artifacts, giving insight into the high desert's development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, my response might be unique. Unlike many who have their own homes, I live in a dormitory within a college campus. The people living around me form my community, and while the surrounding campus is considered my neighborhood, it's less prominent. Despite this unique context, my neighborhood shares common elements with traditional ones, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's explore the \"houses\" first. There are three types of housing in my immediate area: apartments, houses, and dormitories. Apartments usually house 2-4 people per room, with several rooms on each floor and a few floors per building, accommodating around 20 people on average. Actual houses are available for school-affiliated renters, often alumni, but they are fewer in number. Dormitories are the most common, with hundreds of students sharing rooms. Now, regarding the people, my campus is known for its diversity, which is evident in my neighborhood. Various cultures and ages are represented, with staff living in houses, newer students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. The neighborhood also offers a variety of stores and a park. The stores include dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, ensuring that all needs can be met within the neighborhood. The park is a communal space kept clean and safe by the community itself.",
            "Having been here for roughly a decade, I feel I'm well-versed enough to share some insights. Initially, I was disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough goodbye, but my parents wanted better opportunities for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood was considered upgrading in terms of housing and schooling. It took time to adapt, but I made friends and a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, who live next door, and Dennis, who we were close with. Mr. Glen and his re-marriage to Ms. Veda was a highlight. I caught her garter but missed her bouquet! That night was filled with dancing and fun, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I'm exploring more. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life's simple pleasures. Nature at the park calms me, and I practice my balance with sticks and a bokken wooden sword. The basketball and tennis courts, though underused, are a fun reminder of my dad's coaching with Mr. Graves. There's a lot of good memories and many more to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college I attend, which I find very convenient. The area is predominantly residential, with a few restaurants and bars scattered about, many of which are reasonably priced. One of the bars underwent a name change and has a higher price point, but the service and drinks are still quite good. The neighborhood residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly students and lower-income individuals due to the affordability of the housing. There's an elementary school nearby, and the neighborhood is family-friendly. I don't know my neighbors, which suits me just fine. They often smoke weed, leading the building management to install an air freshener outside their door, an amusing but somewhat disrespectful gesture. The buildings around me are mostly older but may have been recently renovated. Newer apartment buildings nearby lack quality construction, yet command high rents due to their campus proximity. There's an affordable restaurant a short walk away that serves food on paper plates and primarily uses microwaves. Across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. Thanks to city funds, the road underwent renovations last summer, improving the overall aesthetics of the area. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, although some were recently removed, leaving stumps. Behind my complex, there's a row of apartments and a tree line. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind me, which is less desirable due to poor sidewalk conditions and dilapidated buildings. There's plenty of greenery, possibly to conceal the buildings' state. Crime is an issue in the neighborhood, with incidents occurring at nearby apartment complexes. While the area has its drawbacks, I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the college and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is composed of duplexes arranged in a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses. The only distinguishing feature is their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. We often gather at the end of a shared driveway in the evenings, chatting while the kids play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I ended up in my bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the temperature drop from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. Then, the sun came out and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera to share the sight with my Facebook friends and family. The streets were quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Then, life resumed as usual, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. This neighborhood is a gem, especially for this New Hampshire transplant who loves the southern accents. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most residents. While the houses look the same externally, interiors vary in size. I enjoy walking through the largest field behind my home to the pond, where I've spotted deer and heard giant bullfrogs in the morning. Living forty minutes from Charlotte is like being in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that braying in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood right before I began eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually connected with someone living two houses down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still present. This neighborhood is typical of an average American suburb, filled with two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing outside is common. Most days are quiet, and I've never had issues with any neighbors. I feel secure in this neighborhood, having never experienced any package thefts from my porch. I can trust my neighbors. There's a park nearby where I have cherished memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood kids. Although I once got elbowed in the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's young children. The park evokes nostalgia in me for various reasons. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, all within a one-mile radius. Residents often use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Most popular food places are fast food chains, which are common in suburban areas. There are numerous stores offering everything one might need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and unique ethnic stores like an Indian-owned shop for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm happy with my neighborhood. Reading about other people's experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a cozy little town in South Carolina that blends in with others but plays a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely made up of farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle ranches dominating the landscape. Houses outside the main town are spaced far apart, typically two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs designed to withstand the scorching summer heat. These homes are usually set back from the road, with the front fields used for farming or livestock. The main part of town features a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the few stores located in the town are situated. These include Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, Gary's, a small burger chain, and Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and expensive, with many residents preferring to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which offers a wide range of everyday items and remains busy throughout the day. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a community-renowned woman and employs movers to deliver furniture. Attached to the store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding services. Both a medical clinic and veterinary practice are located away from the town center, serving the town's residents. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students must travel to the next town. The town lacks parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed. Despite its limited amenities, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might miss it in a blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about this place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was unexpected, as nearly every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard any news about this before, and neither had my friends. It seems to be a common struggle. Some of my friends struggle financially and have to be frugal. Over time, we've adapted and started to appreciate the dusty scent of thrift store treasures and vintage clothing. Adulthood brings with it a certain smell, including the scent of dusty old magazines in a closed piano that lingers even after cleaning. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every day, but the stores remain quiet. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. Year by year, the city is growing, with more people and vehicles. It's similar to New York, where everyone is focused on their own pursuits, and there's little expectation for interaction. People here don't pry into each other's lives, and you can maintain your privacy as long as you want. The city just keeps moving, like waves on the beach. Despite living in a large, impersonal cityscape, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't entirely made a mistake in choosing to live here. They're a community of friends who gather for various events, assist each other when needed, and generally treat each other well. I like most of them, and they seem to enjoy my company as well. It's people like my neighbors that make this place feel like home.",
            "The area where I live is typical of suburban neighborhoods, characterized by its cookie-cutter feel. A homeowner's association is clearly active here, ensuring that all the homes are well-maintained. Each house is a single-family residence with a similar layout: a small yard with landscaping, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are recently paved, with no potholes, and most houses are single-story, although some are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there are communal mailbox banks and lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. It offers several community pools and walking trails, and is mostly populated by retirees, with a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. There's a single mall nearby, offering a range of stores from high-end to bargain outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the nearest significant destination. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of recreational facilities, and while it's not close to major shopping centers, they are easily accessible by car.",
            "I reside in a small town located just outside the suburbs of a major city, in the Midwest. My immediate neighborhood on the east side is our town's most economically challenged area, with low property values and predominantly low-income residents. While not unpleasant, the area is often overlooked in terms of development. My neighbors are generally welcoming, and the crime rate, while slightly higher than other parts of town, is still relatively low. Some violent crimes have occurred nearby, including shootings and a homicide in recent years. Our neighboring family lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has only been affected by minor issues like items vanishing from our porch. The community has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this, including addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions. Our town boasts excellent schools with supportive staff, including my son's elementary school, which is particularly inclusive and positive. The PTO organizes events to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students to prevent hunger. The City Council has improved the town's appearance, mainly focusing on the center and west side, where most shopping and traffic are concentrated. This has led to some neglect on the east side, where my family lives. Despite these challenges, we enjoy our town as it meets our family's needs and offers a comfortable and adequate home. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It's situated on a hill and surrounded by historic structures. I live in a 7-story apartment building opposite an old theater and a few blocks away is a popular summertime arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd. On weekends in June and July, the line to get in can be quite long. Nearby is a sizable city park. Despite the area, it's well-maintained, with concrete paths and tall stairs. During winter, homeless people set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and steps, a strategy to stay warmer together despite the rain and lack of snow. What I appreciate about my city isn't just its historic architecture but the resilience and community spirit of its people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still carries echoes of its past. Despite ongoing efforts to clean it up, it's considered one of the tougher neighborhoods. Even so, people here care deeply about their community and each other. There's a warning to avoid walking the streets at night if you're white, a remnant of old prejudices. I feel a sense of belonging here, where people have offered me kindness rather than threat. It's a place where a laundromat stayed open late to charge my phone and where I've received unexpected acts of kindness.",
            "I reside in rural Michigan, a small town nestled between expansive farmlands and tourist cities. There aren't any major retail outlets like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's, and everything necessitates a drive. Despite this, my location is picturesque, surrounded by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches nearby for a refreshing dip. The neighborhood reflects a typical small-town atmosphere, featuring non-identical, older homes with full basements and diverse yard features like trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences. It's a community where neighbors are familiar with one another, and houses are well-maintained with open, inviting porches. The area is quiet, peaceful, and safe, with local services like the sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center nearby. The neighborhood has baseball and softball fields, a small airport, a nearby ice cream shop, and a park within cycling distance. It's a great place to live and raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Residential areas are scattered across commercial zones where diverse businesses thrive, from offices and shops to restaurants and entertainment venues.

Despite the closeness, traffic is notorious, with 10-mile commutes sometimes taking hours, especially during peak times. Most residents depend on cars, and parking is a challenge. Recently, the city has seen extensive construction, adding more high-rise apartments, which has both increased its appeal and stirred resident concerns about overcrowding and worsening traffic.\n\nHousing here is varied, with a mix of standalone homes, duplexes, and small apartment buildings.

            "My neighborhood is distinctive. It features a mix of standalone single-family residences and a few houses that have been subdivided into two units while still attached. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a past era when living in the suburbs was the quintessential American dream. Although this dream has somewhat faded, many neighborhoods like mine persist, still embodying that dream and clinging to it. Residents are less optimistic than they once were, yard maintenance has declined, but cars are still in driveways, and youth continue to play as if the world is their playground. The long-standing public school, nearly a century old, continues to inspire future generations while stirring nostalgia in older residents. Church attendance is sparse, but basketball courts remain full. Homes vary in appearance but share a sense of familiarity. Super \"A\" supermarket, owned by a large Yemeni family, is likely the only Arab-owned business in the neighborhood, where the majority of residents are African American. The wide streets are often filled with children playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Most residents have deep roots in the community, with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school, influenced by Hollywood, is now a pharmacy. An old movie theater, showing discounted classic films, attracts seniors who appreciate the quiet atmosphere. A single expressway runs through our town, with entrances and exits in a neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was denied by elders who feared it would alter the neighborhood.

            "“Where is everything?” she wondered aloud as we passed the sprawling cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. “This is amazing!” I exclaimed, knowing she’d be taken aback by the vast emptiness. She hailed from a city where the nearest grocery store was just a short walk from her doorstep—she’d never encountered such openness before.

            "Portland, Oregon, is famously known for its eccentricity, encapsulated by its unofficial motto \"Keep Portland Weird\". This phrase is a nod to the city's past, when it was less renowned and less pricey, fostering unique, creative subcultures. To some, it's an invitation to embrace a place where people find being weird as a compliment. Despite gentrification and the influx of wealthy newcomers, Portland retains its quirkiness. Being weird in Portland means accepting the unusual, not necessarily being always accepting. The city enjoys modern amenities and issues, like most places, but with a lighter touch. Portland is home to a mix of yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and professionals, as well as colorful houses with herb and vegetable gardens in the streets. The city's peculiarity is highlighted by \"free boxes\", which can contain discarded items like clothes and books. The magic of finding such treasures in Southeast Portland neighborhoods embodies what Portland means to many. However, Portland faces challenges like drug abuse, homelessness, and mental health issues, with some residents expressing care or disdain towards both the homeless and the city's drug problem. In this, Portland shares commonalities with other places.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, overlooking the sunrise and sunset each day, regardless of whether I remember them or not. Their presence remains constant, unaffected by life's ups and downs. Even during stressful times, they beckon me to pause and find solace, offering me the strength to endure. I first noticed them when I began my undergraduate studies. While the university and town have their own attractions, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself offers a blend of old and new, with charming cafes and bustling streets, and a serene atmosphere that makes it feel both suburban and urban. It's in these various settings that I've formed cherished memories, from late-night study sessions to movie nights. However, the town is not without its challenges, and the ponds, in particular, have been a place of both reflection and tears. As I watched the pond's inhabitants, I pondered my own sense of purpose. I wandered through the town, eventually reaching a main street where the sun painted the sky with its rays. At that moment, I realized I was heading north, and there they were—those unyielding mountains that have always been there, inspiring my resolve to keep going, one day at a time.",

Power lines around the area are often damaged and repaired haphazardly, and there are many tall evergreen trees that obstruct views of the ocean. Despite this, the sunsets are breathtaking, though it's usually cloudy. The environment is damp, and moss grows abundantly on surfaces. Children are rare, as are stores, with the nearest food options being a few restaurants by the waterfront.

            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee. The street I live on connects two state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, but otherwise, it's a quiet community. There's not much turnover in residents, so I'm familiar with most of my neighbors. They spend their time on yard work and chores. In winter, we sled down the street's hill. Our house is at the front corner, so we see all the comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars on the street. We notice any unusual vehicles. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children often ride bikes and engage in typical suburban activities. As a family of four – my wife and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen – we work from home, so we're a regular sight in the neighborhood. We enjoy playing and grilling outside, even in the rain. From March to October, we frequently hear lawn mowers due to the abundant trees that provide shade and annual leaf raking and burning. I like the smell of the burning leaves, which signals the onset of fall. Recently, winter has been mild, extending the fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I often work in the garage on my truck or other projects, and with the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays like Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas, it's quiet until visiting families arrive, resulting in extra cars parked on the street. Overall, I enjoy living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a thoroughfare.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant view of brown landscapes and the extravagant care required to maintain a lush lawn. In the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but now there are many new additions, making it look increasingly like a city. While people are generally friendly, every city has its good and bad parts. My neighborhood is predominantly inhabited by friendly seniors, making it a pleasant place to live. The stores here are mostly chain retailers, with few independent or specialty shops. The most common jobs are in construction, which is due to the city's ongoing development. I'm concerned about the extensive building, as I enjoy the existing layout. I left a busy city and prefer this slower pace. My full-time job is in construction, as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the attractions of living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain support various ecosystems and species, requiring residents to learn about and respect these non-human inhabitants. My family has adapted well to our surroundings; my children are particularly fond of lizards and desert bugs. For attractions, the San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville offers a fun family experience. Additionally, Wrightwood nearby provides a snowy mountain backdrop for winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's geological, archaeological, and historical artifacts, giving insight into the high desert's development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, my response might be unique. Unlike many who have their own homes, I live in a dormitory within a college campus. The people living around me form my community, and while the surrounding campus is considered my neighborhood, it's less prominent. Despite this unique context, my neighborhood shares common elements with traditional ones, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's explore the \"houses\" first. There are three types of housing in my immediate area: apartments, houses, and dormitories. Apartments usually house 2-4 people per room, with several rooms on each floor and a few floors per building, accommodating around 20 people on average. Actual houses are available for school-affiliated renters, often alumni, but they are fewer in number. Dormitories are the most common, with hundreds of students sharing rooms. Now, regarding the people, my campus is known for its diversity, which is evident in my neighborhood. Various cultures and ages are represented, with staff living in houses, newer students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. The neighborhood also offers a variety of stores and a park. The stores include dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, ensuring that all needs can be met within the neighborhood. The park is a communal space kept clean and safe by the community itself.",
            "Having been here for roughly a decade, I feel I'm well-versed enough to share some insights. Initially, I was disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. It was a tough goodbye, but my parents wanted better opportunities for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood was considered upgrading in terms of housing and schooling. It took time to adapt, but I made friends and a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, who live next door, and Dennis, who we were close with. Mr. Glen and his re-marriage to Ms. Veda was a highlight. I caught her garter but missed her bouquet! That night was filled with dancing and fun, especially with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. This neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I'm exploring more. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life's simple pleasures. Nature at the park calms me, and I practice my balance with sticks and a bokken wooden sword. The basketball and tennis courts, though underused, are a fun reminder of my dad's coaching with Mr. Graves. There's a lot of good memories and many more to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently close to the college I attend, which I find very convenient. The area is predominantly residential, with a few restaurants and bars scattered about, many of which are reasonably priced. One of the bars underwent a name change and has a higher price point, but the service and drinks are still quite good. The neighborhood residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly students and lower-income individuals due to the affordability of the housing. There's an elementary school nearby, and the neighborhood is family-friendly. I don't know my neighbors, which suits me just fine. They often smoke weed, leading the building management to install an air freshener outside their door, an amusing but somewhat disrespectful gesture. The buildings around me are mostly older but may have been recently renovated. Newer apartment buildings nearby lack quality construction, yet command high rents due to their campus proximity. There's an affordable restaurant a short walk away that serves food on paper plates and primarily uses microwaves. Across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. Thanks to city funds, the road underwent renovations last summer, improving the overall aesthetics of the area. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, although some were recently removed, leaving stumps. Behind my complex, there's a row of apartments and a tree line. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind me, which is less desirable due to poor sidewalk conditions and dilapidated buildings. There's plenty of greenery, possibly to conceal the buildings' state. Crime is an issue in the neighborhood, with incidents occurring at nearby apartment complexes. While the area has its drawbacks, I appreciate the affordability and proximity to the college and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is composed of duplexes arranged in a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses. The only distinguishing feature is their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. We often gather at the end of a shared driveway in the evenings, chatting while the kids play with toys, draw with chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change in this tech-filled world, like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and last night we heard the sirens for the first time. I ended up in my bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the temperature drop from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. Then, the sun came out and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera to share the sight with my Facebook friends and family. The streets were quiet for an hour before people started returning home. Then, life resumed as usual, with moms and kids playing outside while dinner cooked. This neighborhood is a gem, especially for this New Hampshire transplant who loves the southern accents. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most residents. While the houses look the same externally, interiors vary in size. I enjoy walking through the largest field behind my home to the pond, where I've spotted deer and heard giant bullfrogs in the morning. Living forty minutes from Charlotte is like being in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that braying in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "I arrived in this neighborhood right before I began eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually connected with someone living two houses down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Many of the original residents are still present. This neighborhood is typical of an average American suburb, filled with two-story houses. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing outside is common. Most days are quiet, and I've never had issues with any neighbors. I feel secure in this neighborhood, having never experienced any package thefts from my porch. I can trust my neighbors. There's a park nearby where I have cherished memories, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood kids. Although I once got elbowed in the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's young children. The park evokes nostalgia in me for various reasons. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, all within a one-mile radius. Residents often use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Most popular food places are fast food chains, which are common in suburban areas. There are numerous stores offering everything one might need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and unique ethnic stores like an Indian-owned shop for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm happy with my neighborhood. Reading about other people's experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "My neighborhood is a cozy little town in South Carolina that blends in with others but plays a significant role in the state's agriculture sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely made up of farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle ranches dominating the landscape. Houses outside the main town are spaced far apart, typically two-story structures with metal or gray shingle roofs designed to withstand the scorching summer heat. These homes are usually set back from the road, with the front fields used for farming or livestock. The main part of town features a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the few stores located in the town are situated. These include Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, Gary's, a small burger chain, and Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and expensive, with many residents preferring to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, which offers a wide range of everyday items and remains busy throughout the day. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a community-renowned woman and employs movers to deliver furniture. Attached to the store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming and boarding services. Both a medical clinic and veterinary practice are located away from the town center, serving the town's residents. There's a single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, but middle and high school students must travel to the next town. The town lacks parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed. Despite its limited amenities, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might miss it in a blink of an eye.",
            "The first time I heard about this place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was unexpected, as nearly every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard any news about this before, and neither had my friends. It seems to be a common struggle. Some of my friends struggle financially and have to be frugal. Over time, we've adapted and started to appreciate the dusty scent of thrift store treasures and vintage clothing. Adulthood brings with it a certain smell, including the scent of dusty old magazines in a closed piano that lingers even after cleaning. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every day, but the stores remain quiet. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. Year by year, the city is growing, with more people and vehicles. It's similar to New York, where everyone is focused on their own pursuits, and there's little expectation for interaction. People here don't pry into each other's lives, and you can maintain your privacy as long as you want. The city just keeps moving, like waves on the beach. Despite living in a large, impersonal cityscape, my neighbors make me feel like I haven't entirely made a mistake in choosing to live here. They're a community of friends who gather for various events, assist each other when needed, and generally treat each other well. I like most of them, and they seem to enjoy my company as well. It's people like my neighbors that make this place feel like home.",
            "The area where I live is typical of suburban neighborhoods, characterized by its cookie-cutter feel. A homeowner's association is clearly active here, ensuring that all the homes are well-maintained. Each house is a single-family residence with a similar layout: a small yard with landscaping, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are recently paved, with no potholes, and most houses are single-story, although some are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there are communal mailbox banks and lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of the city, blending rural and suburban elements. It offers several community pools and walking trails, and is mostly populated by retirees, with a few middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. There's a single mall nearby, offering a range of stores from high-end to bargain outlets. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the nearest significant destination. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained area with plenty of recreational facilities, and while it's not close to major shopping centers, they are easily accessible by car.",
            "I reside in a small town located just outside the suburbs of a major city, in the Midwest. My immediate neighborhood on the east side is our town's most economically challenged area, with low property values and predominantly low-income residents. While not unpleasant, the area is often overlooked in terms of development. My neighbors are generally welcoming, and the crime rate, while slightly higher than other parts of town, is still relatively low. Some violent crimes have occurred nearby, including shootings and a homicide in recent years. Our neighboring family lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has only been affected by minor issues like items vanishing from our porch. The community has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this, including addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions. Our town boasts excellent schools with supportive staff, including my son's elementary school, which is particularly inclusive and positive. The PTO organizes events to promote family involvement and educational progress. The school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students to prevent hunger. The City Council has improved the town's appearance, mainly focusing on the center and west side, where most shopping and traffic are concentrated. This has led to some neglect on the east side, where my family lives. Despite these challenges, we enjoy our town as it meets our family's needs and offers a comfortable and adequate home. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It's situated on a hill and surrounded by historic structures. I live in a 7-story apartment building opposite an old theater and a few blocks away is a popular summertime arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd. On weekends in June and July, the line to get in can be quite long. Nearby is a sizable city park. Despite the area, it's well-maintained, with concrete paths and tall stairs. During winter, homeless people set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and steps, a strategy to stay warmer together despite the rain and lack of snow. What I appreciate about my city isn't just its historic architecture but the resilience and community spirit of its people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence, still carries echoes of its past. Despite ongoing efforts to clean it up, it's considered one of the tougher neighborhoods. Even so, people here care deeply about their community and each other. There's a warning to avoid walking the streets at night if you're white, a remnant of old prejudices. I feel a sense of belonging here, where people have offered me kindness rather than threat. It's a place where a laundromat stayed open late to charge my phone and where I've received unexpected acts of kindness.",
            "I reside in rural Michigan, a small town nestled between expansive farmlands and tourist cities. There aren't any major retail outlets like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's, and everything necessitates a drive. Despite this, my location is picturesque, surrounded by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches nearby for a refreshing dip. The neighborhood reflects a typical small-town atmosphere, featuring non-identical, older homes with full basements and diverse yard features like trampolines, play sets, gardens, and fences. It's a community where neighbors are familiar with one another, and houses are well-maintained with open, inviting porches. The area is quiet, peaceful, and safe, with local services like the sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center nearby. The neighborhood has baseball and softball fields, a small airport, a nearby ice cream shop, and a park within cycling distance. It's a great place to live and raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is unique. Most homes are single-family residences, but some have been divided into two, yet still attached. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, along with many others, evokes an era when living in the suburbs was a cherished American dream. While this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to embody its spirit. There's a sense of hopefulness that's waning, as the upkeep of yards has declined, but the presence of cars in driveways and kids playing on the streets remains. The public school, standing for nearly a century, inspires both today's youth and evokes nostalgia in older residents. The churches are sparse, often empty, but basketball courts are always busy. Each home is distinct yet shares a common atmosphere. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemen family, the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American. The wide streets host frequent games of football, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a time when everyone knew one another.

            "On first impression, this residential area might not seem appealing, as it's behind a shopping strip and not the typical place one would expect to find desirable living spaces. However, if you venture behind an old, abandoned Whole Foods, past the hotels that are mainly used during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a thriving community. Along these streets, there are several apartment complexes situated close together, like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and placed side by side. The first complexes you encounter have been in the news for less than ideal activities, but the ones beside them and the ones after that offer a vastly different experience, largely unknown to local residents. Across from these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet, peaceful set of buildings that are home to students beginning their days, often with coffee in hand. The iron gates creak open to let students in one by one, much to the dismay of commuters who find their traffic delayed. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park and a rehabilitation center for those who have suffered bone injuries. The center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan that gently circulates the warm summer air. Children play in the park, while elderly residents walk their dogs, wondering at the teenage skateboarders and nodding at the teenagers by the playground. Nearby are shops like a sushi place, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon, allowing for multitasking activities such as filling your pool, getting a manicure, and eating hibachi chicken all at once.

            "\"Where are we?\" she inquired as we drove past endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, knowing she'd be taken aback by the vast open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was a short walk from her house, she'd never seen so much open space. Surprised by the omnipresence of cornfields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that moment, she understood my background better. As we drove down a winding rural road, we passed a water-filled quarry, and beyond it was the small community where I lived. The homes were mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least a half-acre of land, meticulously maintained by the residents.

The winters in my small town were punishingly cold, but the transformation of the landscape was breathtaking. The lush greenery gave way to frosty bare trees, and any snowfall turned the backyard into a winter wonderland.

            "Portland is renowned for its eccentricity, as embodied by the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" painted on a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza parlor, bar, music venue, and strip club. For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when Portland was less well-known and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the city's quirkiness, where being weird is considered a compliment. Despite an influx of wealthy Californians and the proliferation of luxury condominiums, Portland remains true to its eccentric character. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of the unusual. Portland is not immune to modern conveniences and issues, such as drug problems and homelessness, but it handles them with a unique blend of seriousness and levity. Roaming neighborhoods in Portland reveals a myriad of colors, home gardens brimming with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and \"free boxes\" that sometimes contain treasures like clothes and books. The city's magical atmosphere is a draw, but Portland also boasts yoga, soccer games, and a mix of professionals and dreamers. In essence, Portland is a place where people pursue their passions, often with a touch of whimsy. The city's drug problem and homelessness issues are complex and divisive, with the non-homeless population oscillating between care and antipathy. In this, Portland is surprisingly typical.",

Despite my preoccupation with life and work, they remain constant, steadfast and undeterred by life's challenges. On days of great stress, they insist on being seen, offering solace and renewed strength. I first encountered them during my undergraduate years, when the mountains north of campus first captivated me. While the university's architectural wonders and natural beauty have their own appeal, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is a mix of picturesque neighborhoods and bustling downtown areas, with charming cafes and historic buildings. Just beyond the library, one can escape to a peaceful small town atmosphere. This blend of urban and suburban life creates a unique charm, inviting exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's walking through the park with friends or rushing to a movie, the town holds both joyful and challenging experiences. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for reflection and emotional release. Watching wildlife and contemplating life's purpose, I often find myself drawn to the sunrise and the distant mountains. The sun's rays paint the sky, and as I gaze at the sunrise, I'm reminded that the mountains have always been there, symbolizing my resilience and perseverance.",

Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly prevalent and well-liked by locals for their high-quality food, low prices, and convenience. The area is quite diverse, with many Asian-owned businesses and a newly renovated park featuring basketball and soccer courts, playgrounds, and a water fountain. Few corporate buildings exist; mostly, you'll find co-op and condo apartments, with many two-family homes. While most residents are friendly, noise is a common issue, with frequent car music and early-morning traffic.

Incidents like bullying and package theft have happened in the past, and pet waste is a common issue. Be prepared to step in dog waste frequently.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downwards, and my house is situated at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because joggers frequently use it for their daily exercise. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which, despite its occasional potholes and rough patches, is still used by vehicles. The overhead electrical and telephone wires are worn and weathered, frequently damaged by storms and debris, making them appear patched and makeshift. A thick layer of fog often obscures the view, but at sunset, the water reflects a warm glow and the sky turns orange, albeit intermittently due to frequent cloud cover. Moss thrives in the damp climate, coating roofs, cars, and railings, even on my car after a month parked in my driveway. The area is sparsely populated with children; instead, there are numerous older residents, many of whom are retired, and their pets, particularly dogs, frequent the neighborhood. Large rabbits roam the area, causing issues for gardeners, but my cats have largely kept them at bay. The usual assortment of birds, ranging from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks, can be seen, with crows often chasing off the larger ones.

            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee, located at the intersection of two state highways, which results in moderate traffic. The neighborhood is otherwise peaceful and quiet, with few residents moving in and out, allowing me to become familiar with most of the neighbors. Most people occupy themselves with yard work and daily tasks, and in the winter, we enjoy sledding down our side street. Our house is situated at the corner of our street, providing us with a clear view of everyone's comings and goings. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles and are accustomed to the routine activities of our neighbors, such as walking for exercise or playing on bicycles. We are a family of four, consisting of myself, my wife, and our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, so our presence is a familiar sight to the neighbors. We often play outside, even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, as the trees in our neighborhood, which were originally part of a wooded area, provide ample shade and abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I find the smell of burning leaves to be a comforting sign of the fall season. The winters have been mild lately, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, and we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, which feels like a hub for neighborhood activity. During holidays, the neighborhood remains fairly quiet, except for families visiting from out of town, which increases the number of parked cars. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't for the through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the monotony of endless brown landscapes. When you do encounter a lawn, you know the owner is investing heavily in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were spread out, but now new developments have changed the landscape, making it resemble a city more each day. The neighborhood is generally friendly, but like any city, it has its ups and downs. The elderly residents in my area are particularly friendly. The stores here are mostly chain stores, with the exception of a few independent ones. If you're looking for upscale shopping, you'll need to travel, as there aren't many high-end stores. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, likely due to the city's growth and undeveloped areas. I'm concerned about the city's rapid development, as I prefer the current state of things. I moved from a big city, and I'm not keen on returning anytime soon. My job as a drywall and T-bar installer keeps me busy in the construction field. My family and I have adapted well to the desert, with our children being particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. The high desert's stark beauty draws many visitors, and the unique ecosystems and wildlife require protection. The Victorville area offers several attractions, such as the San Bernardino County Fair, and nearby Wrightwood for winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert through geological and paleontological specimens, as well as Native American artifacts and historical objects.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a bit unconventional. Unlike most respondents who are homeowners with personal lives, my neighborhood is primarily the campus where I live. The people I live with in my dormitory are my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood secondarily. Despite this, my neighborhood shares common features with conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses that make up my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, houses, and dorm rooms. In apartments, each room hosts 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and each building typically has 2 floors, housing around 20 people. Actual houses, available for school-affiliated renters, usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are mainly occupied by alumni, but they're less common. Dorm rooms are the most prevalent, with hundreds of students living in them, usually two per room. My school values diversity, reflected in the varied cultures and ages of my neighborhood's inhabitants. Professional staff live in houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older ones in apartments. Moving on, my campus neighborhood boasts a variety of stores and a single park. Stores offer dining options and the school's unique merchandise, and the park is a community space maintained by all residents.",
            "Having lived here for around a decade, I can share some insights about my neighborhood. Initially, I was quite disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my friends and family back home, but my parents felt we needed a better place to live, with a safer neighborhood and a better high school. Over time, I grew accustomed to my new surroundings and made some new friends and acquaintances. I didn't get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, along with Dennis, who lived next door. They've been like family to me. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding; it was a joyous occasion that I'd like to replicate someday in the future with my wife. I even caught the bouquet when Ms. Veda threw it, though I didn't catch the flowers! We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore it more. I've only ventured so far, usually with friends like Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes, I go to the park to relax and enjoy nature, which calms my soul. I also practice my balance skills and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had a good time with Mr. Graves. There are many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and I find it convenient. It's predominantly apartment buildings with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but the service and drinks are still good. Most residents are college students or lower-income individuals. There's a nearby elementary school, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally pleasant. The building management tackled a weed-smoking issue by installing an air freshener, which amused my boyfriend and me. The surrounding buildings are old but may have been renovated. Down the street, newer apartments have been built, but I don't like them due to their cheap construction and expensive rents. A nearby restaurant offers affordable meals, but it's not very fancy. Across the street is a gas station with mixed reviews, but the road was recently improved with city funds. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, and the area behind it has a tree line with another set of apartments. The neighboring street, 43rd, is less appealing with dilapidated sidewalks and buildings. While crime has occurred there, I appreciate the affordable rent and nearby amenities, including the college and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged in a cul-de-sac, spaced out to appear like individual houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The vast majority of residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of our impromptu driveway for casual conversations while the neighborhood children play with their toys or fly kites. This setting, with its fields and trees under blue skies and white clouds, feels like a breath of fresh air in our increasingly digital world. This year, we faced tornado warnings and heard sirens for the first time last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm was intense with large hailstones falling, and the weather changed rapidly, with temperatures dropping from 92°F to 75°F. After the storm, the road steamed from the sudden temperature change, and a double rainbow appeared in the clearing skies. I quickly snapped photos to share with friends and family. The neighborhood remained quiet for an hour before people returned from where they'd been during the storm. Dinner was then prepared, and the neighborhood felt like a small, tight-knit community. I've recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and enjoy the southern accents. Each residence is a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, but the interiors vary in size. I love strolling along the large field behind my home to the nearby pond, which isn't ideal for swimming. I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs in the morning. It's a charming community only forty minutes from Charlotte. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I consider myself fortunate to have found this peaceful neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was entering eighth grade. Although it was challenging to make friends initially, I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another guy from the same street. They no longer reside here, but the memories linger. Most of the original residents from when I moved are still here. My neighborhood is typical of many American suburban areas, characterized by two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outdoors. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I feel comfortable leaving packages on my porch without fear of theft. The park nearby holds many fond memories. I've played various sports there, including basketball, football, and baseball, with other neighborhood kids. Although I have a memorable incident of getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's children, who are younger and enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes nostalgic feelings for various reasons. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. While food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, there are also numerous pizza places. The neighborhood has all the necessary stores, including dry cleaners, pharmacies (Walgreens and CVS), and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. Some stores cater to diverse tastes, like an Indian-owned shop for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about the problems other people face with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town in South Carolina, indistinguishable from others but pivotal to the agricultural sector. Johnston, acclaimed as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displays this motto on its welcoming sign. Most of the town's landscape is farmland, either covered in peach trees or cattle. Houses, predominantly two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spread out, often located away from the road to allow for farmland in front. The town center boasts a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all shops are clustered. Food options include Hong Kong (a Chinese eatery), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a burger joint). A once-present pizzeria closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, is well-known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a respected local, is attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Medical and veterinary care are provided by small but well-equipped practices. Johnston Elementary School serves students up to fifth grade; middle and high school students travel to the next town. With limited recreational facilities, plans are afoot to create a 2.5-acre park for family outings and to attract visitors/residents. Despite the lack of attractions, Johnston is a pleasant, unassuming town.",
            "I first heard about this place through a podcast featuring stories of missing persons. The price of apartments in the neighborhood was astonishing, around a thousand dollars a month, which came as a shock as neither I nor my friends had any knowledge of this. Perhaps it's the struggle, as many of us find ourselves crying ourselves to sleep at night due to the high cost of living. However, we've adapted to be frugal over time, developing an appreciation for the scent of old flea market toys and second-hand clothing. The smell of adulthood is more subtle, settling into the leather and lingering even after thorough cleaning. There are three thrift stores nearby, along with a charity thrift shop, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. While the downtown area is bustling with traffic and people each morning, the thrift stores remain quiet and serene, providing a peaceful refuge to lose an afternoon. The city, with its headquarters for a major e-commerce and delivery company, is rapidly growing, reminiscent of New York, where everyone is focused on their own pursuits and personal space is respected. The city accepts and embraces solitude, allowing individuals to maintain their privacy. I'm fortunate to live here, as I get along well with my neighbors, who reciprocate my kindness by helping each other with tasks like delivering mail. My apartment, despite being in a dehumanizing modernist sprawl, feels like a community of friends, providing a sense of belonging and companionship.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a discernible homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll encounter a uniform landscape of well-kept single-family homes. Front yards are identical, featuring tiny grass patches, decorative stones, short driveways, and occasional trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. The roads are pristine, with no potholes, and most houses are single-story, although some are two-story. Mailboxes are centrally located at the end of the street, requiring keys for individual access, and there are large lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements, with ample land for community pools, walking trails, and dog walking. Most residents are retired, with some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city is unexpectedly large yet maintains a small-town feel, offering a variety of amenities. A single mall caters to local needs, and major chain stores are accessible within a 15-minute drive. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained neighborhood with plenty of recreational facilities, and although close to amenities is not ideal, it offers a peaceful, serene living environment.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, situated just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it's not an unattractive or unpleasant place. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me with a smile when I walk down the street. While the crime rate is slightly higher than in other parts of town, it remains low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has not been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources to combat this, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, fostering a positive atmosphere where he hasn't faced bullying despite his special needs. His school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The town has made improvements, such as repaving roads and refurbishing parks, but these have mainly occurred in the central and western parts, where most shopping areas and traffic are located. The eastern side, where I live, has been largely neglected, causing some tension among residents. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are adequate shopping options, and our home, while not of high value, is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural atmosphere. It's perched on a hill, with buildings that hold significant historical value. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater, and a short block away is a charming arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, the line of people waiting to enter can be quite long. A few blocks above is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious for the area it occupies. The park is surrounded by concrete, with high steps built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and stairs, as this central location is warmer and closer to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. While I appreciate the historical architecture of my city, what I cherish about my neighborhood is the spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories passed down through generations and newcomers like me. Despite remaining one of the rougher areas of the city, residents work hard to maintain a clean environment and show concern for their community. A common warning is to avoid walking around Hilltop at night if you're white, which I believe reflects the past and societal biases. However, I feel at home here, with people offering help and kindness more than anything else. It's a place where laundry owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and shopkeepers have offered me warmth and kindness on the dreariest nights.",
            "I reside in the rural heart of America, specifically within a small town in Michigan, where landscapes transition from farmland to quaint tourist destinations. Commercial giants like big city malls, Walmart, Target, and Applebee’s are absent, necessitating a drive to access any amenities. Despite this, I live in an incredibly scenic region, bordered by the stunning waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. With countless beaches nearby, water access is plentiful. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town aesthetic, characterized by older homes, many with full basements visible from the street. The houses are diverse in appearance, ranging from classic aluminum siding to vibrant colors, and are typically accompanied by well-maintained yards featuring amenities like trampolines, playsets, and even gardens or fences for animals. The neighborhood reflects a hardworking community, with families and neighbors who are well-acquainted with one another. This is a peaceful, safe, and quiet place to call home, offering amenities like a local sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center within walking distance. Additionally, parks, sports fields, and an airport are close by, with the sounds of planes taking off and landing often heard from within the neighborhood. My children can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, and a trip downtown is just a short walk away. In essence, our small town is a wonderful place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, along with many others, evokes an era when living in the suburbs was a cherished American dream. While this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to embody its spirit. There's a sense of hopefulness that's waning, as the upkeep of yards has declined, but the presence of cars in driveways and kids playing on the streets remains.

Each home is distinct yet shares a common atmosphere. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemen family, the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American.

            "On first impression, this residential area might not seem appealing, as it's behind a shopping strip and not the typical place one would expect to find desirable living spaces. However, if you venture behind an old, abandoned Whole Foods, past the hotels that are mainly used during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a thriving community. Along these streets, there are several apartment complexes situated close together, like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and placed side by side. The first complexes you encounter have been in the news for less than ideal activities, but the ones beside them and the ones after that offer a vastly different experience, largely unknown to local residents. Across from these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet, peaceful set of buildings that are home to students beginning their days, often with coffee in hand. The iron gates creak open to let students in one by one, much to the dismay of commuters who find their traffic delayed. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park and a rehabilitation center for those who have suffered bone injuries. The center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan that gently circulates the warm summer air. Children play in the park, while elderly residents walk their dogs, wondering at the teenage skateboarders and nodding at the teenagers by the playground. Nearby are shops like a sushi place, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon, allowing for multitasking activities such as filling your pool, getting a manicure, and eating hibachi chicken all at once.

            "\"Where are we?\" she inquired as we drove past endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, knowing she'd be taken aback by the vast open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was a short walk from her house, she'd never seen so much open space. Surprised by the omnipresence of cornfields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that moment, she understood my background better.

Crossing a handmade wooden bridge, you'd find an untouched sanctuary filled with native trees, herbs, and wildflowers, where I spent much of my childhood.

The winters in my small town were punishingly cold, but the transformation of the landscape was breathtaking. The lush greenery gave way to frosty bare trees, and any snowfall turned the backyard into a winter wonderland.

            "Portland is renowned for its eccentricity, as embodied by the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" painted on a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza parlor, bar, music venue, and strip club. For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when Portland was less well-known and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the city's quirkiness, where being weird is considered a compliment. Despite an influx of wealthy Californians and the proliferation of luxury condominiums, Portland remains true to its eccentric character. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of the unusual. Portland is not immune to modern conveniences and issues, such as drug problems and homelessness, but it handles them with a unique blend of seriousness and levity. Roaming neighborhoods in Portland reveals a myriad of colors, home gardens brimming with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and \"free boxes\" that sometimes contain treasures like clothes and books. The city's magical atmosphere is a draw, but Portland also boasts yoga, soccer games, and a mix of professionals and dreamers. In essence, Portland is a place where people pursue their passions, often with a touch of whimsy. The city's drug problem and homelessness issues are complex and divisive, with the non-homeless population oscillating between care and antipathy. In this, Portland is surprisingly typical.",

Despite my preoccupation with life and work, they remain constant, steadfast and undeterred by life's challenges. On days of great stress, they insist on being seen, offering solace and renewed strength. I first encountered them during my undergraduate years, when the mountains north of campus first captivated me. While the university's architectural wonders and natural beauty have their own appeal, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.

This blend of urban and suburban life creates a unique charm, inviting exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's walking through the park with friends or rushing to a movie, the town holds both joyful and challenging experiences. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for reflection and emotional release. Watching wildlife and contemplating life's purpose, I often find myself drawn to the sunrise and the distant mountains. The sun's rays paint the sky, and as I gaze at the sunrise, I'm reminded that the mountains have always been there, symbolizing my resilience and perseverance.",

            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downwards, and my house is situated at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because joggers frequently use it for their daily exercise. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which, despite its occasional potholes and rough patches, is still used by vehicles. The overhead electrical and telephone wires are worn and weathered, frequently damaged by storms and debris, making them appear patched and makeshift. A thick layer of fog often obscures the view, but at sunset, the water reflects a warm glow and the sky turns orange, albeit intermittently due to frequent cloud cover.

The area is sparsely populated with children; instead, there are numerous older residents, many of whom are retired, and their pets, particularly dogs, frequent the neighborhood. Large rabbits roam the area, causing issues for gardeners, but my cats have largely kept them at bay. The usual assortment of birds, ranging from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks, can be seen, with crows often chasing off the larger ones. The area lacks shops, but a short hike to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The bay, while not spacious, offers a clear view of the opposite shore even on foggy days, with the shoreline providing a fun spot to throw rocks into the water",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee, located at the intersection of two state highways, which results in moderate traffic. The neighborhood is otherwise peaceful and quiet, with few residents moving in and out, allowing me to become familiar with most of the neighbors. Most people occupy themselves with yard work and daily tasks, and in the winter, we enjoy sledding down our side street. Our house is situated at the corner of our street, providing us with a clear view of everyone's comings and goings. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles and are accustomed to the routine activities of our neighbors, such as walking for exercise or playing on bicycles. We are a family of four, consisting of myself, my wife, and our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, so our presence is a familiar sight to the neighbors. We often play outside, even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, as the trees in our neighborhood, which were originally part of a wooded area, provide ample shade and abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I find the smell of burning leaves to be a comforting sign of the fall season. The winters have been mild lately, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, and we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, which feels like a hub for neighborhood activity. During holidays, the neighborhood remains fairly quiet, except for families visiting from out of town, which increases the number of parked cars. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't for the through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the monotony of endless brown landscapes. When you do encounter a lawn, you know the owner is investing heavily in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were spread out, but now new developments have changed the landscape, making it resemble a city more each day. The neighborhood is generally friendly, but like any city, it has its ups and downs. The elderly residents in my area are particularly friendly. The stores here are mostly chain stores, with the exception of a few independent ones. If you're looking for upscale shopping, you'll need to travel, as there aren't many high-end stores. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, likely due to the city's growth and undeveloped areas. I'm concerned about the city's rapid development, as I prefer the current state of things. I moved from a big city, and I'm not keen on returning anytime soon. My job as a drywall and T-bar installer keeps me busy in the construction field. My family and I have adapted well to the desert, with our children being particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. The high desert's stark beauty draws many visitors, and the unique ecosystems and wildlife require protection. The Victorville area offers several attractions, such as the San Bernardino County Fair, and nearby Wrightwood for winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert through geological and paleontological specimens, as well as Native American artifacts and historical objects.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a bit unconventional. Unlike most respondents who are homeowners with personal lives, my neighborhood is primarily the campus where I live. The people I live with in my dormitory are my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood secondarily. Despite this, my neighborhood shares common features with conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses that make up my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, houses, and dorm rooms. In apartments, each room hosts 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and each building typically has 2 floors, housing around 20 people. Actual houses, available for school-affiliated renters, usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are mainly occupied by alumni, but they're less common. Dorm rooms are the most prevalent, with hundreds of students living in them, usually two per room. My school values diversity, reflected in the varied cultures and ages of my neighborhood's inhabitants. Professional staff live in houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older ones in apartments. Moving on, my campus neighborhood boasts a variety of stores and a single park. Stores offer dining options and the school's unique merchandise, and the park is a community space maintained by all residents.",
            "Having lived here for around a decade, I can share some insights about my neighborhood. Initially, I was quite disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my friends and family back home, but my parents felt we needed a better place to live, with a safer neighborhood and a better high school. Over time, I grew accustomed to my new surroundings and made some new friends and acquaintances. I didn't get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, along with Dennis, who lived next door. They've been like family to me. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding; it was a joyous occasion that I'd like to replicate someday in the future with my wife. I even caught the bouquet when Ms. Veda threw it, though I didn't catch the flowers! We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore it more. I've only ventured so far, usually with friends like Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes, I go to the park to relax and enjoy nature, which calms my soul. I also practice my balance skills and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had a good time with Mr. Graves. There are many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and I find it convenient. It's predominantly apartment buildings with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but the service and drinks are still good. Most residents are college students or lower-income individuals. There's a nearby elementary school, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally pleasant. The building management tackled a weed-smoking issue by installing an air freshener, which amused my boyfriend and me. The surrounding buildings are old but may have been renovated. Down the street, newer apartments have been built, but I don't like them due to their cheap construction and expensive rents. A nearby restaurant offers affordable meals, but it's not very fancy. Across the street is a gas station with mixed reviews, but the road was recently improved with city funds. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, and the area behind it has a tree line with another set of apartments. The neighboring street, 43rd, is less appealing with dilapidated sidewalks and buildings. While crime has occurred there, I appreciate the affordable rent and nearby amenities, including the college and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged in a cul-de-sac, spaced out to appear like individual houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The vast majority of residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of our impromptu driveway for casual conversations while the neighborhood children play with their toys or fly kites. This setting, with its fields and trees under blue skies and white clouds, feels like a breath of fresh air in our increasingly digital world. This year, we faced tornado warnings and heard sirens for the first time last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm was intense with large hailstones falling, and the weather changed rapidly, with temperatures dropping from 92°F to 75°F. After the storm, the road steamed from the sudden temperature change, and a double rainbow appeared in the clearing skies. I quickly snapped photos to share with friends and family. The neighborhood remained quiet for an hour before people returned from where they'd been during the storm. Dinner was then prepared, and the neighborhood felt like a small, tight-knit community. I've recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and enjoy the southern accents. Each residence is a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, but the interiors vary in size. I love strolling along the large field behind my home to the nearby pond, which isn't ideal for swimming. I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs in the morning. It's a charming community only forty minutes from Charlotte. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I consider myself fortunate to have found this peaceful neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was entering eighth grade. Although it was challenging to make friends initially, I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another guy from the same street. They no longer reside here, but the memories linger. Most of the original residents from when I moved are still here. My neighborhood is typical of many American suburban areas, characterized by two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outdoors. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I feel comfortable leaving packages on my porch without fear of theft. The park nearby holds many fond memories. I've played various sports there, including basketball, football, and baseball, with other neighborhood kids. Although I have a memorable incident of getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's children, who are younger and enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes nostalgic feelings for various reasons. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. While food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, there are also numerous pizza places. The neighborhood has all the necessary stores, including dry cleaners, pharmacies (Walgreens and CVS), and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. Some stores cater to diverse tastes, like an Indian-owned shop for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about the problems other people face with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town in South Carolina, indistinguishable from others but pivotal to the agricultural sector. Johnston, acclaimed as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displays this motto on its welcoming sign. Most of the town's landscape is farmland, either covered in peach trees or cattle. Houses, predominantly two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spread out, often located away from the road to allow for farmland in front. The town center boasts a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all shops are clustered. Food options include Hong Kong (a Chinese eatery), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a burger joint). A once-present pizzeria closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, is well-known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a respected local, is attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Medical and veterinary care are provided by small but well-equipped practices. Johnston Elementary School serves students up to fifth grade; middle and high school students travel to the next town. With limited recreational facilities, plans are afoot to create a 2.5-acre park for family outings and to attract visitors/residents. Despite the lack of attractions, Johnston is a pleasant, unassuming town.",
            "I first heard about this place through a podcast featuring stories of missing persons. The price of apartments in the neighborhood was astonishing, around a thousand dollars a month, which came as a shock as neither I nor my friends had any knowledge of this. Perhaps it's the struggle, as many of us find ourselves crying ourselves to sleep at night due to the high cost of living. However, we've adapted to be frugal over time, developing an appreciation for the scent of old flea market toys and second-hand clothing. The smell of adulthood is more subtle, settling into the leather and lingering even after thorough cleaning. There are three thrift stores nearby, along with a charity thrift shop, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. While the downtown area is bustling with traffic and people each morning, the thrift stores remain quiet and serene, providing a peaceful refuge to lose an afternoon. The city, with its headquarters for a major e-commerce and delivery company, is rapidly growing, reminiscent of New York, where everyone is focused on their own pursuits and personal space is respected. The city accepts and embraces solitude, allowing individuals to maintain their privacy. I'm fortunate to live here, as I get along well with my neighbors, who reciprocate my kindness by helping each other with tasks like delivering mail. My apartment, despite being in a dehumanizing modernist sprawl, feels like a community of friends, providing a sense of belonging and companionship.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a discernible homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll encounter a uniform landscape of well-kept single-family homes. Front yards are identical, featuring tiny grass patches, decorative stones, short driveways, and occasional trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. The roads are pristine, with no potholes, and most houses are single-story, although some are two-story. Mailboxes are centrally located at the end of the street, requiring keys for individual access, and there are large lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements, with ample land for community pools, walking trails, and dog walking. Most residents are retired, with some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city is unexpectedly large yet maintains a small-town feel, offering a variety of amenities. A single mall caters to local needs, and major chain stores are accessible within a 15-minute drive. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained neighborhood with plenty of recreational facilities, and although close to amenities is not ideal, it offers a peaceful, serene living environment.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, situated just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it's not an unattractive or unpleasant place. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me with a smile when I walk down the street. While the crime rate is slightly higher than in other parts of town, it remains low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has not been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources to combat this, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, fostering a positive atmosphere where he hasn't faced bullying despite his special needs. His school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The town has made improvements, such as repaving roads and refurbishing parks, but these have mainly occurred in the central and western parts, where most shopping areas and traffic are located. The eastern side, where I live, has been largely neglected, causing some tension among residents. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are adequate shopping options, and our home, while not of high value, is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural atmosphere. It's perched on a hill, with buildings that hold significant historical value. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater, and a short block away is a charming arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, the line of people waiting to enter can be quite long. A few blocks above is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious for the area it occupies. The park is surrounded by concrete, with high steps built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and stairs, as this central location is warmer and closer to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. While I appreciate the historical architecture of my city, what I cherish about my neighborhood is the spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories passed down through generations and newcomers like me. Despite remaining one of the rougher areas of the city, residents work hard to maintain a clean environment and show concern for their community. A common warning is to avoid walking around Hilltop at night if you're white, which I believe reflects the past and societal biases. However, I feel at home here, with people offering help and kindness more than anything else. It's a place where laundry owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and shopkeepers have offered me warmth and kindness on the dreariest nights.",
            "I reside in the rural heart of America, specifically within a small town in Michigan, where landscapes transition from farmland to quaint tourist destinations. Commercial giants like big city malls, Walmart, Target, and Applebee’s are absent, necessitating a drive to access any amenities. Despite this, I live in an incredibly scenic region, bordered by the stunning waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. With countless beaches nearby, water access is plentiful. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town aesthetic, characterized by older homes, many with full basements visible from the street. The houses are diverse in appearance, ranging from classic aluminum siding to vibrant colors, and are typically accompanied by well-maintained yards featuring amenities like trampolines, playsets, and even gardens or fences for animals. The neighborhood reflects a hardworking community, with families and neighbors who are well-acquainted with one another. This is a peaceful, safe, and quiet place to call home, offering amenities like a local sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center within walking distance. Additionally, parks, sports fields, and an airport are close by, with the sounds of planes taking off and landing often heard from within the neighborhood. My children can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, and a trip downtown is just a short walk away. In essence, our small town is a wonderful place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is unique. Most homes are single-family residences, but some have been divided into two, yet still attached. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, along with many others, evokes an era when living in the suburbs was a cherished American dream. While this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to embody its spirit. There's a sense of hopefulness that's waning, as the upkeep of yards has declined, but the presence of cars in driveways and kids playing on the streets remains. The public school, standing for nearly a century, inspires both today's youth and evokes nostalgia in older residents. The churches are sparse, often empty, but basketball courts are always busy. Each home is distinct yet shares a common atmosphere. There's a large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemen family, the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most residents are African American. The wide streets host frequent games of football, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a time when everyone knew one another.

            "On first impression, this residential area might not seem appealing, as it's behind a shopping strip and not the typical place one would expect to find desirable living spaces. However, if you venture behind an old, abandoned Whole Foods, past the hotels that are mainly used during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a thriving community. Along these streets, there are several apartment complexes situated close together, like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and placed side by side. The first complexes you encounter have been in the news for less than ideal activities, but the ones beside them and the ones after that offer a vastly different experience, largely unknown to local residents. Across from these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet, peaceful set of buildings that are home to students beginning their days, often with coffee in hand. The iron gates creak open to let students in one by one, much to the dismay of commuters who find their traffic delayed. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park and a rehabilitation center for those who have suffered bone injuries. The center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan that gently circulates the warm summer air. Children play in the park, while elderly residents walk their dogs, wondering at the teenage skateboarders and nodding at the teenagers by the playground. Nearby are shops like a sushi place, a swimming supply store, and a nail salon, allowing for multitasking activities such as filling your pool, getting a manicure, and eating hibachi chicken all at once.

            "\"Where are we?\" she inquired as we drove past endless cornfields that stretched out as far as the eye could see. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, knowing she'd be taken aback by the vast open landscape. Coming from a town where the nearest grocery store was a short walk from her house, she'd never seen so much open space. Surprised by the omnipresence of cornfields, I shared my upbringing in rural Ohio with her, and in that moment, she understood my background better. As we drove down a winding rural road, we passed a water-filled quarry, and beyond it was the small community where I lived. The homes were mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least a half-acre of land, meticulously maintained by the residents.

The winters in my small town were punishingly cold, but the transformation of the landscape was breathtaking. The lush greenery gave way to frosty bare trees, and any snowfall turned the backyard into a winter wonderland.

            "Portland is renowned for its eccentricity, as embodied by the phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" painted on a building that serves multiple purposes like a pizza parlor, bar, music venue, and strip club. For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when Portland was less well-known and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to embrace the city's quirkiness, where being weird is considered a compliment. Despite an influx of wealthy Californians and the proliferation of luxury condominiums, Portland remains true to its eccentric character. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of the unusual. Portland is not immune to modern conveniences and issues, such as drug problems and homelessness, but it handles them with a unique blend of seriousness and levity. Roaming neighborhoods in Portland reveals a myriad of colors, home gardens brimming with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and \"free boxes\" that sometimes contain treasures like clothes and books. The city's magical atmosphere is a draw, but Portland also boasts yoga, soccer games, and a mix of professionals and dreamers. In essence, Portland is a place where people pursue their passions, often with a touch of whimsy. The city's drug problem and homelessness issues are complex and divisive, with the non-homeless population oscillating between care and antipathy. In this, Portland is surprisingly typical.",

Despite my preoccupation with life and work, they remain constant, steadfast and undeterred by life's challenges. On days of great stress, they insist on being seen, offering solace and renewed strength. I first encountered them during my undergraduate years, when the mountains north of campus first captivated me. While the university's architectural wonders and natural beauty have their own appeal, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is a mix of picturesque neighborhoods and bustling downtown areas, with charming cafes and historic buildings. Just beyond the library, one can escape to a peaceful small town atmosphere. This blend of urban and suburban life creates a unique charm, inviting exploration and cherished memories. Whether it's walking through the park with friends or rushing to a movie, the town holds both joyful and challenging experiences. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for reflection and emotional release. Watching wildlife and contemplating life's purpose, I often find myself drawn to the sunrise and the distant mountains. The sun's rays paint the sky, and as I gaze at the sunrise, I'm reminded that the mountains have always been there, symbolizing my resilience and perseverance.",

Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly prevalent and well-liked by locals for their high-quality food, low prices, and convenience. The area is quite diverse, with many Asian-owned businesses and a newly renovated park featuring basketball and soccer courts, playgrounds, and a water fountain. Few corporate buildings exist; mostly, you'll find co-op and condo apartments, with many two-family homes. While most residents are friendly, noise is a common issue, with frequent car music and early-morning traffic.

Incidents like bullying and package theft have happened in the past, and pet waste is a common issue. Be prepared to step in dog waste frequently.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downwards, and my house is situated at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because joggers frequently use it for their daily exercise. Due to the absence of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which, despite its occasional potholes and rough patches, is still used by vehicles. The overhead electrical and telephone wires are worn and weathered, frequently damaged by storms and debris, making them appear patched and makeshift. A thick layer of fog often obscures the view, but at sunset, the water reflects a warm glow and the sky turns orange, albeit intermittently due to frequent cloud cover. Moss thrives in the damp climate, coating roofs, cars, and railings, even on my car after a month parked in my driveway. The area is sparsely populated with children; instead, there are numerous older residents, many of whom are retired, and their pets, particularly dogs, frequent the neighborhood. Large rabbits roam the area, causing issues for gardeners, but my cats have largely kept them at bay. The usual assortment of birds, ranging from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks, can be seen, with crows often chasing off the larger ones.

            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small southern town in Tennessee, located at the intersection of two state highways, which results in moderate traffic. The neighborhood is otherwise peaceful and quiet, with few residents moving in and out, allowing me to become familiar with most of the neighbors. Most people occupy themselves with yard work and daily tasks, and in the winter, we enjoy sledding down our side street. Our house is situated at the corner of our street, providing us with a clear view of everyone's comings and goings. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles and are accustomed to the routine activities of our neighbors, such as walking for exercise or playing on bicycles. We are a family of four, consisting of myself, my wife, and our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, so our presence is a familiar sight to the neighbors. We often play outside, even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck. The sound of lawn mowers is a regular occurrence from March to October, as the trees in our neighborhood, which were originally part of a wooded area, provide ample shade and abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I find the smell of burning leaves to be a comforting sign of the fall season. The winters have been mild lately, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, and we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, which feels like a hub for neighborhood activity. During holidays, the neighborhood remains fairly quiet, except for families visiting from out of town, which increases the number of parked cars. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't for the through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the monotony of endless brown landscapes. When you do encounter a lawn, you know the owner is investing heavily in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were spread out, but now new developments have changed the landscape, making it resemble a city more each day. The neighborhood is generally friendly, but like any city, it has its ups and downs. The elderly residents in my area are particularly friendly. The stores here are mostly chain stores, with the exception of a few independent ones. If you're looking for upscale shopping, you'll need to travel, as there aren't many high-end stores. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, likely due to the city's growth and undeveloped areas. I'm concerned about the city's rapid development, as I prefer the current state of things. I moved from a big city, and I'm not keen on returning anytime soon. My job as a drywall and T-bar installer keeps me busy in the construction field. My family and I have adapted well to the desert, with our children being particularly fond of lizards and desert insects. The high desert's stark beauty draws many visitors, and the unique ecosystems and wildlife require protection. The Victorville area offers several attractions, such as the San Bernardino County Fair, and nearby Wrightwood for winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum showcases the natural history and culture of the high desert through geological and paleontological specimens, as well as Native American artifacts and historical objects.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a bit unconventional. Unlike most respondents who are homeowners with personal lives, my neighborhood is primarily the campus where I live. The people I live with in my dormitory are my community, and the surrounding campus is my neighborhood secondarily. Despite this, my neighborhood shares common features with conventional ones. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the houses that make up my neighborhood. There are three types of housing here: apartments, houses, and dorm rooms. In apartments, each room hosts 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and each building typically has 2 floors, housing around 20 people. Actual houses, available for school-affiliated renters, usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are mainly occupied by alumni, but they're less common. Dorm rooms are the most prevalent, with hundreds of students living in them, usually two per room. My school values diversity, reflected in the varied cultures and ages of my neighborhood's inhabitants. Professional staff live in houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older ones in apartments. Moving on, my campus neighborhood boasts a variety of stores and a single park. Stores offer dining options and the school's unique merchandise, and the park is a community space maintained by all residents.",
            "Having lived here for around a decade, I can share some insights about my neighborhood. Initially, I was quite disheartened when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my friends and family back home, but my parents felt we needed a better place to live, with a safer neighborhood and a better high school. Over time, I grew accustomed to my new surroundings and made some new friends and acquaintances. I didn't get to know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, along with Dennis, who lived next door. They've been like family to me. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding; it was a joyous occasion that I'd like to replicate someday in the future with my wife. I even caught the bouquet when Ms. Veda threw it, though I didn't catch the flowers! We danced all night, and I enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore it more. I've only ventured so far, usually with friends like Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes, I go to the park to relax and enjoy nature, which calms my soul. I also practice my balance skills and bring my bokken wooden sword for fun. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had a good time with Mr. Graves. There are many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and I find it convenient. It's predominantly apartment buildings with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but the service and drinks are still good. Most residents are college students or lower-income individuals. There's a nearby elementary school, and while I don't know my neighbors, they're generally pleasant. The building management tackled a weed-smoking issue by installing an air freshener, which amused my boyfriend and me. The surrounding buildings are old but may have been renovated. Down the street, newer apartments have been built, but I don't like them due to their cheap construction and expensive rents. A nearby restaurant offers affordable meals, but it's not very fancy. Across the street is a gas station with mixed reviews, but the road was recently improved with city funds. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, and the area behind it has a tree line with another set of apartments. The neighboring street, 43rd, is less appealing with dilapidated sidewalks and buildings. While crime has occurred there, I appreciate the affordable rent and nearby amenities, including the college and bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged in a cul-de-sac, spaced out to appear like individual houses. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. The vast majority of residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of our impromptu driveway for casual conversations while the neighborhood children play with their toys or fly kites. This setting, with its fields and trees under blue skies and white clouds, feels like a breath of fresh air in our increasingly digital world. This year, we faced tornado warnings and heard sirens for the first time last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm was intense with large hailstones falling, and the weather changed rapidly, with temperatures dropping from 92°F to 75°F. After the storm, the road steamed from the sudden temperature change, and a double rainbow appeared in the clearing skies. I quickly snapped photos to share with friends and family. The neighborhood remained quiet for an hour before people returned from where they'd been during the storm. Dinner was then prepared, and the neighborhood felt like a small, tight-knit community. I've recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina and enjoy the southern accents. Each residence is a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, but the interiors vary in size. I love strolling along the large field behind my home to the nearby pond, which isn't ideal for swimming. I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs in the morning. It's a charming community only forty minutes from Charlotte. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I consider myself fortunate to have found this peaceful neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was entering eighth grade. Although it was challenging to make friends initially, I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another guy from the same street. They no longer reside here, but the memories linger. Most of the original residents from when I moved are still here. My neighborhood is typical of many American suburban areas, characterized by two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outdoors. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the neighbors. I feel comfortable leaving packages on my porch without fear of theft. The park nearby holds many fond memories. I've played various sports there, including basketball, football, and baseball, with other neighborhood kids. Although I have a memorable incident of getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, the good times far outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's children, who are younger and enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes nostalgic feelings for various reasons. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. While food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, there are also numerous pizza places. The neighborhood has all the necessary stores, including dry cleaners, pharmacies (Walgreens and CVS), and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. Some stores cater to diverse tastes, like an Indian-owned shop for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about the problems other people face with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town in South Carolina, indistinguishable from others but pivotal to the agricultural sector. Johnston, acclaimed as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displays this motto on its welcoming sign. Most of the town's landscape is farmland, either covered in peach trees or cattle. Houses, predominantly two-story with either metal or gray shingle roofs, are spread out, often located away from the road to allow for farmland in front. The town center boasts a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all shops are clustered. Food options include Hong Kong (a Chinese eatery), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a burger joint). A once-present pizzeria closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, is well-known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, but many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a respected local, is attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet groomer offering various services. Medical and veterinary care are provided by small but well-equipped practices. Johnston Elementary School serves students up to fifth grade; middle and high school students travel to the next town. With limited recreational facilities, plans are afoot to create a 2.5-acre park for family outings and to attract visitors/residents. Despite the lack of attractions, Johnston is a pleasant, unassuming town.",
            "I first heard about this place through a podcast featuring stories of missing persons. The price of apartments in the neighborhood was astonishing, around a thousand dollars a month, which came as a shock as neither I nor my friends had any knowledge of this. Perhaps it's the struggle, as many of us find ourselves crying ourselves to sleep at night due to the high cost of living. However, we've adapted to be frugal over time, developing an appreciation for the scent of old flea market toys and second-hand clothing. The smell of adulthood is more subtle, settling into the leather and lingering even after thorough cleaning. There are three thrift stores nearby, along with a charity thrift shop, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. While the downtown area is bustling with traffic and people each morning, the thrift stores remain quiet and serene, providing a peaceful refuge to lose an afternoon. The city, with its headquarters for a major e-commerce and delivery company, is rapidly growing, reminiscent of New York, where everyone is focused on their own pursuits and personal space is respected. The city accepts and embraces solitude, allowing individuals to maintain their privacy. I'm fortunate to live here, as I get along well with my neighbors, who reciprocate my kindness by helping each other with tasks like delivering mail. My apartment, despite being in a dehumanizing modernist sprawl, feels like a community of friends, providing a sense of belonging and companionship.",
            "The area where I reside is a quintessential cookie-cutter suburb, with a discernible homeowner's association presence. Upon entering, you'll encounter a uniform landscape of well-kept single-family homes. Front yards are identical, featuring tiny grass patches, decorative stones, short driveways, and occasional trees. Every home boasts a two-car garage. The roads are pristine, with no potholes, and most houses are single-story, although some are two-story. Mailboxes are centrally located at the end of the street, requiring keys for individual access, and there are large lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements, with ample land for community pools, walking trails, and dog walking. Most residents are retired, with some middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city is unexpectedly large yet maintains a small-town feel, offering a variety of amenities. A single mall caters to local needs, and major chain stores are accessible within a 15-minute drive. Overall, it's a safe, well-maintained neighborhood with plenty of recreational facilities, and although close to amenities is not ideal, it offers a peaceful, serene living environment.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest, situated just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the east side, is the town's most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with many houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it's not an unattractive or unpleasant place. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me with a smile when I walk down the street. While the crime rate is slightly higher than in other parts of town, it remains low. In the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has not been directly affected by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources to combat this, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, fostering a positive atmosphere where he hasn't faced bullying despite his special needs. His school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The town has made improvements, such as repaving roads and refurbishing parks, but these have mainly occurred in the central and western parts, where most shopping areas and traffic are located. The eastern side, where I live, has been largely neglected, causing some tension among residents. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are adequate shopping options, and our home, while not of high value, is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural atmosphere. It's perched on a hill, with buildings that hold significant historical value. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater, and a short block away is a charming arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, the line of people waiting to enter can be quite long. A few blocks above is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious for the area it occupies. The park is surrounded by concrete, with high steps built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and stairs, as this central location is warmer and closer to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. While I appreciate the historical architecture of my city, what I cherish about my neighborhood is the spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories passed down through generations and newcomers like me. Despite remaining one of the rougher areas of the city, residents work hard to maintain a clean environment and show concern for their community. A common warning is to avoid walking around Hilltop at night if you're white, which I believe reflects the past and societal biases. However, I feel at home here, with people offering help and kindness more than anything else. It's a place where laundry owners have stayed open late to charge my phone when I'm caught in the rain, and shopkeepers have offered me warmth and kindness on the dreariest nights.",
            "I reside in the rural heart of America, specifically within a small town in Michigan, where landscapes transition from farmland to quaint tourist destinations. Commercial giants like big city malls, Walmart, Target, and Applebee’s are absent, necessitating a drive to access any amenities. Despite this, I live in an incredibly scenic region, bordered by the stunning waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. With countless beaches nearby, water access is plentiful. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town aesthetic, characterized by older homes, many with full basements visible from the street. The houses are diverse in appearance, ranging from classic aluminum siding to vibrant colors, and are typically accompanied by well-maintained yards featuring amenities like trampolines, playsets, and even gardens or fences for animals. The neighborhood reflects a hardworking community, with families and neighbors who are well-acquainted with one another. This is a peaceful, safe, and quiet place to call home, offering amenities like a local sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center within walking distance. Additionally, parks, sports fields, and an airport are close by, with the sounds of planes taking off and landing often heard from within the neighborhood. My children can easily ride their bikes to the nearby park, and a trip downtown is just a short walk away. In essence, our small town is a wonderful place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, located in a bustling metropolis, is incredibly diverse. Residential zones are scattered among commercial areas that house a mix of offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, ranging from big-name corporate stores to trendy, locally-owned boutiques. Some of these shops line the streets, bringing a lively atmosphere to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods. Nearby parks are popular among families with young children. The neighborhood is also home to several distinct communities, such as a prominent LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding slightly beyond my immediate area reveals more diverse communities, including Little Korea, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving; a mere 10 miles may take two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most residents prefer cars over walking, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking issues. Despite this, the city has seen significant construction with new apartments being built, much to the dismay of many long-term residents who fear more congestion.

My home has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, reflecting the American dream of suburban living that once captivated our country. Though that dream seems to be waning, remnants of it remain, like my neighborhood and others, hinting at its enduring allure. While optimism and yard maintenance have declined, cars still populate driveways, and kids still play as if the world is their playground. The century-old public school still stands, inspiring both today's youth and stirring nostalgic memories in older residents. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Though each home is distinctive, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket, \"Super A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. Wide streets allow kids to play football, pausing briefly to let cars pass. Most residents have deep roots here, with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school is now a pharmacy, and an old movie theater shows classic films at discounted prices, attracting older residents but not the youth. A single expressway runs through our town, with exits and entrances in the neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was rejected due to fears of ruining the neighborhood, a decision supported by the youth and opposed by the elders.

However, if you venture behind the old, derelict Whole Foods and make your way past the hotels that only operate during brief periods, you'll uncover a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged in a tightly packed, linear fashion, much like Russian nesting dolls. The first apartments you encounter have a spotty reputation, so we'll skip over them. But the ones adjacent and beyond are a different story, hidden from the gaze of most locals. Across from these complexes lies a quiet community college satellite campus, where students begin their days with coffee in hand, as commuters grumble at the traffic delays on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, bordering a park and a rehabilitation center for injured individuals. The center's cheerful porch furniture and lazy ceiling fan create a welcoming atmosphere, while children play and old residents walk their dogs. The neighborhood is a blend of modern and timeless, with a sushi restaurant, swimming supply store, nail salon, and frozen yogurt shop nearby.

            "She inquired, \"Where is everything?\" as we cruised past the endless cornfields. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the expansiveness of the open landscape.

Regardless of how busy or distracted I become, they remain unyielding, undeterred by life's challenges. In times of stress, they call out to me, and when I look to them, they offer solace and strength, helping me carry on day by day. I moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my first captivating sight. While the university itself is a beautiful place with its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is lovely as well, with charming cafes where I spent many hours studying, and a bustling downtown area that contrasts with its quiet, small-town streets. This mix of environments creates a unique atmosphere, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories. From late-night walks in the park to movie nights in town, the town holds both joyful and painful memories. The ponds are especially conducive to reflection and quiet moments. I often found myself contemplating life's purpose while watching the creatures there. One day, as I walked past the pond and through the park, I reached a main street. The sun rose, casting its golden rays on the palm trees, and I realized I was heading north. There, I saw the mountains, their solid presence filling the sky, reigniting my resolve.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding it shouldn't be a problem—public transportation is readily available and popular throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel you're in the heart of the city. During your stay, you'll encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents, resulting in Asian-owned businesses on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common and popular among locals, offering excellent quality food at affordable prices and convenient locations. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other near where I live. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, it's diverse with immigrants and their children living here. Many large local businesses are Asian-owned. There's also a nearby park that's been recently renovated, featuring ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. The park is diverse, with people from various backgrounds getting along well. Corporate buildings aren't prevalent; instead, you'll find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and many are friendly but noisy, with frequent car noise and occasional dog waste on the streets. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's important to be cautious, as there have been incidents of bullying and package theft. I've personally experienced physical assault in the past, but these incidents are less common nowadays. Additionally, there's a lack of adherence to the city's regulations regarding dog waste, leading to a significant amount of it on the streets. Keep your shoes clean, as dog waste is a common issue in the neighborhood.",
            "In my residential area, there's a scarcity of sidewalks. The terrain slopes downward, placing my house at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, dubbed the \"work out hill\" by locals for its popularity among joggers. Lacking sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk along the road, which is rough and dangerous to drive on. Power lines and telephone wires are in disrepair, often damaged by storms and debris. Towering evergreens surround the area, but they're unpopular due to blocking ocean views, leading to many residents building houses high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are spectacular, with the water's reflection creating a glow, though it's often cloudy and damp, resulting in a moist environment where moss thrives. Children are few, and the neighborhood is primarily inhabited by elderly residents and their dogs, which are often seen in yards or on the streets. Gardens and lawns are frequently undermined by rabbits, while various birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be spotted. There are no stores nearby, but a few waterfront restaurants serve local seafood. The bay is narrow, allowing visibility of the opposite shore most days, and the rocky shoreline is good for tossing stones into the water.",
            "Our home is situated in a typical residential area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Being located at the junction of two state highways, we experience a bit more traffic than we'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains mostly quiet. With a relatively stable population, I'm familiar with most of my neighbors, who generally keep to themselves and focus on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house at the end of the street allows us to see most of the neighborhood's comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars driven by our neighbors. Unusual vehicles catch our attention. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on their bikes. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. We work from home and are often outside playing, even in the rain. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the aroma of barbecue fills the air. The lawn mowing season runs from March to October, with leaves being raked and burned in the fall, which I also like as a sign of the season. The neighborhood is wooded, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf cleanup. Recent winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless expecting guests, which is uncommon. I enjoy tinkering in the garage, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, but some families visit from out of town, with extra vehicles parked on the street. All in all, I'm fond of living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",

When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but the area has seen considerable development with new additions, making it increasingly urban-like. The community is generally welcoming, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is populated by friendly seniors, and the shops are mostly chain establishments, with few independent stores. The primary employment sector here is construction, given the city's undeveloped areas. I've grown fond of the unique wildlife, which includes lizards and desert insects, although I prefer this location over my previous big-city home. Victorville offers attractions like the San Bernardino County Fair and nearby snow-capped mountains, while the Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's natural history and culture.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I might describe it in a way that's a bit different. While typical answers might come from homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation is unique. My neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I live, with my dormitory residents being my community, and the surrounding campus as my extended neighborhood. While this is unconventional, my neighborhood shares some common elements with traditional neighborhoods, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the types of \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to note the three types of housing I reside in: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, rooms typically house 2-4 people with 4-6 rooms per floor, and a building can accommodate around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents. These houses are fewer in number due to their lower efficiency. Finally, dormitories are the most common housing type, with hundreds of students living in rooms meant for two people, with exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the mix of cultures and ages in my neighborhood. Professional staff tend to live in houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Moving forward, stores and parks make up the remaining aspects of my neighborhood. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from typical dining options to the school's own branded clothing and grocery stores, ensuring all necessities are available within the neighborhood. The park is a popular gathering spot for the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the neighborhood community itself.",
            "After spending roughly 10 years in this neighborhood, I can certainly share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite tough for me. I was heartbroken to leave behind my old home and friends, but my parents were eager for a better future for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered improved housing and a better high school, which was seen as a step up from what we were used to. Over the years, I adapted to my new surroundings and formed new friendships, albeit some were less than ideal. I never got to know most of my neighbors deeply, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They’ve been a source of joy and support, almost like family. I particularly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where he re-married. It was a fun and memorable event, and it got me thinking about my own future. I even caught the bride's garter! Although I didn't catch the bouquet, we all danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I haven’t seen her since but hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it more freely. I’ve only ventured a bit, mostly hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We enjoyed our time playing video games and taking life easy. Sometimes, I’d visit the park and find solace in nature, practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot and even bringing my bokken wooden sword. I also enjoy the basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a long time. My father and best friend, Mr. Graves, taught us tennis, and we always had a great time despite the rigorous training. I have plenty of happy memories here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "The college I attend is close to my neighborhood, which I enjoy for its proximity to the school. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but still offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are college students or have lower incomes, a reflection of the affordable housing. An elementary school is nearby, and my neighborhood has a mix of friendly and younger residents. My neighbors are not well-known to me, and their smoking habits have led to an air freshener unit being installed outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are mostly older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, new apartments have been constructed, although their quality is questionable, and the rent is higher than it should be due to their campus proximity. A nearby restaurant serves food on paper plates and uses microwaves, while across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. A city-funded road improvement project has made the area look nicer with a new sidewalk and landscaped medians. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although some have been removed, leaving stumps, while behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is more appealing than 43rd, which has poorly maintained sidewalks and shabby buildings. While crime is an issue in the surrounding apartment complexes, I appreciate living where I do due to its affordability and convenient amenities. The university and two bus stops are within walking distance, making it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood comprises a series of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced irregularly to mimic individual houses, the only distinct feature being their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Residents are largely friendly with one another. On some evenings, we gather at the end of an unplanned driveway, chatting as neighborhood children engage in play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing respite from our tech-savvy world, almost as if we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. The only recent challenge has been the tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens, and I found myself seeking shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road steamed as temperatures dropped from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I hurried to capture it on camera. The neighborhood remained quiet for a while, then returned to normal, with people coming home and families going about their evening routines. I appreciate this friendly community, which is like a small village. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most here. While the exteriors are similar, interiors vary, some quite small. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, seeing deer, and hearing morning rooster crowing and the evening donkey braying. It's a wonderful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood right as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but eventually, I developed strong bonds with a couple of kids living nearby. Although they no longer reside there, the memories remain. The original residents who lived here when I first moved in are still around for the most part. My neighborhood is quite typical of an average American suburb, featuring numerous two-story homes. On warm weekends, children's laughter fills the air as they play outside. Most days, the neighborhood is peaceful. I've never encountered any issues with neighbors, and the community is generally welcoming. I've ordered numerous online packages without any issues, and I trust my neighbors implicitly. A park is just a short walk from my house, where I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. Although I had a unpleasant experience there once, getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the happy memories far outweigh the bad ones. Now, I often visit the park with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes many nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many residents now prefer food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. While fast-food chains are prevalent, the area also has several pizza places and a range of stores to cater to every need. There's a dry cleaner, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood, and seeing news reports of other people's negative experiences with neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "The town of Johnston, a sleepy little place in South Carolina, isn't particularly remarkable, but it plays a substantial role in agriculture. It's renowned as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with expansive fields mainly dedicated to peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are typically two-story structures, spaced far from the road, with either metal roofs to beat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. The town's commercial center is minimal, featuring only a single stoplight at an intersection where the three main stores lie: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is the sole option for groceries, with many residents preferring to shop at a nearby Walmart. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. There's a small, community-known furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman. Attached to it is a pet grooming service, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Medical care is provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both situated away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the younger students, while middle and high school students attend schools in the next town. The town lacks parks, but a new 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to provide family activities and attract more residents. Entertainment options are limited, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or diverse dining choices. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a pleasant town, so small that one could pass through without noticing.",
            "The initial time I found out about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment around was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's due to the financial struggles. Some of my friends have mentioned that they cry themselves to sleep at night because of the expensive living costs. We've adapted to being frugal over time. You get used to the dusty scent of flea market toys and moth-eaten clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you might just be accustomed to the current situation. But the flea market persists. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It sticks in the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you wouldn't hear that noise inside the thrift stores. Regardless of the outside activity, the stores are peaceful and a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. It's the headquarters of one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, still experiencing some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really cares about you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue its rhythm like waves on a beach. It's an energetic place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always some sort of activity. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are quite kind to me. I try to keep my space clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I help with each other's mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't entirely ruined my life.",
            "The residential area where I live can be characterized as quintessential suburban living. The neighborhood is dominated by a homeowner's association, whose diligent efforts are evident in the pristine condition of the single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll find immaculate front yards, each with a small patch of greenery, decorative stones, and compact driveways. Scattered trees add to the landscaping. Every home features a two-car garage. As you navigate the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved roads, free of defects like potholes. While most homes are single-story, a few are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, located at the end of the street, with individual keys necessary for access. Larger lockers handle package deliveries. This uniformity is due to the HOA's stringent rules. My neighborhood lies at the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements. The size of the area allows for ample space, including several community pools and walking trails that ensure residents stay active without leaving the neighborhood. The community is primarily composed of retirees and is considered safe and close-knit, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is sizable but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a single mall that meets basic shopping needs. Major retail stores can be reached in about 15 minutes, making it convenient for residents to shop. The area is well-maintained and offers a high quality of life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just outside of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is typically considered the most economically challenged part of town. Here, property values are low, and many homes are rented to or owned by low-income residents. While it might not be the most aesthetically pleasing area, it's not unpleasant either. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me warmly when I walk by. Crime rates are somewhat higher than other parts of town, but they're still relatively low. There have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has fortunately not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch. The town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere that has helped him thrive despite his special needs. We have an active PTO planning events to foster family involvement and academic progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated unfairly due to their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center of town and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, our home is comfortable, and we've lived here for over 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture, perched on a hill with historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex across from an old live theater, and a few blocks down, there's a lively arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. Evenings in June and July often find people waiting in line to enter. A short distance away is a large city park, surrounded by concrete with tall steps leading up to it. During winter, particularly when it rains heavily, homeless individuals set up tents in rows along the sidewalks and steps. While snowfall is minimal, the rain can make it challenging to stay warm. Their tents, close to the city center and the nearest family center for miles, provide warmth and easy access to basic services. My affection for the city isn't for its historic architecture, though the tall buildings and rolling hills leading to the ocean are impressive. What I love about my neighborhood is the resilience and community spirit of the people. Once infamous for gang violence, Hilltop's history is still vividly recounted today. Despite the ongoing reputation, residents work hard to keep the area clean and safe. The warnings about not walking alone at night for white people recall the past, tinged with social conditioning. As someone who doesn't entirely fit the mold, I have found acceptance and kindness from the community. It's a place where night walks feel alive, with people offering help rather than harm. Laundromats stay open late to accommodate my needs, and even on the gloomiest nights, strangers show kindness, reminding me of my worth.",
            "I reside in a rural area of Michigan, specifically in a small town. Instead of big city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, you'll find farmland transitioning into small tourist destinations. My home is nestled near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you turn, there's a beach to enjoy. The neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe: older homes, some updated, others retaining their original charm, with full basements visible from the road. Many homes feature aluminum siding and yards complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect a hardworking community, with children and families at the heart. Neighbors are engaged, friendly, and maintain their properties. The area is peaceful, safe, and quiet, with green lawns and well-maintained plants. Nearby are a sheriff's department, health department, city recycling center, sports fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. My kids can bike to the park just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Some of these shops line the streets, bringing a lively atmosphere to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods. Nearby parks are popular among families with young children.

Expanding slightly beyond my immediate area reveals more diverse communities, including Little Korea, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving; a mere 10 miles may take two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most residents prefer cars over walking, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking issues.

My home has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, reflecting the American dream of suburban living that once captivated our country. Though that dream seems to be waning, remnants of it remain, like my neighborhood and others, hinting at its enduring allure. While optimism and yard maintenance have declined, cars still populate driveways, and kids still play as if the world is their playground. The century-old public school still stands, inspiring both today's youth and stirring nostalgic memories in older residents. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Though each home is distinctive, they share a similar feel.

A single expressway runs through our town, with exits and entrances in the neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was rejected due to fears of ruining the neighborhood, a decision supported by the youth and opposed by the elders.

Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged in a tightly packed, linear fashion, much like Russian nesting dolls.

            "She inquired, \"Where is everything?\" as we cruised past the endless cornfields. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the expansiveness of the open landscape.

Regardless of how busy or distracted I become, they remain unyielding, undeterred by life's challenges. In times of stress, they call out to me, and when I look to them, they offer solace and strength, helping me carry on day by day. I moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my first captivating sight. While the university itself is a beautiful place with its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is lovely as well, with charming cafes where I spent many hours studying, and a bustling downtown area that contrasts with its quiet, small-town streets. This mix of environments creates a unique atmosphere, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories. From late-night walks in the park to movie nights in town, the town holds both joyful and painful memories. The ponds are especially conducive to reflection and quiet moments. I often found myself contemplating life's purpose while watching the creatures there. One day, as I walked past the pond and through the park, I reached a main street. The sun rose, casting its golden rays on the palm trees, and I realized I was heading north. There, I saw the mountains, their solid presence filling the sky, reigniting my resolve.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding it shouldn't be a problem—public transportation is readily available and popular throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel you're in the heart of the city. During your stay, you'll encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents, resulting in Asian-owned businesses on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common and popular among locals, offering excellent quality food at affordable prices and convenient locations. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other near where I live. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, it's diverse with immigrants and their children living here. Many large local businesses are Asian-owned. There's also a nearby park that's been recently renovated, featuring ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. The park is diverse, with people from various backgrounds getting along well. Corporate buildings aren't prevalent; instead, you'll find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and many are friendly but noisy, with frequent car noise and occasional dog waste on the streets. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's important to be cautious, as there have been incidents of bullying and package theft. I've personally experienced physical assault in the past, but these incidents are less common nowadays. Additionally, there's a lack of adherence to the city's regulations regarding dog waste, leading to a significant amount of it on the streets. Keep your shoes clean, as dog waste is a common issue in the neighborhood.",
            "In my residential area, there's a scarcity of sidewalks. The terrain slopes downward, placing my house at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, dubbed the \"work out hill\" by locals for its popularity among joggers. Lacking sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk along the road, which is rough and dangerous to drive on. Power lines and telephone wires are in disrepair, often damaged by storms and debris. Towering evergreens surround the area, but they're unpopular due to blocking ocean views, leading to many residents building houses high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are spectacular, with the water's reflection creating a glow, though it's often cloudy and damp, resulting in a moist environment where moss thrives. Children are few, and the neighborhood is primarily inhabited by elderly residents and their dogs, which are often seen in yards or on the streets. Gardens and lawns are frequently undermined by rabbits, while various birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be spotted. There are no stores nearby, but a few waterfront restaurants serve local seafood. The bay is narrow, allowing visibility of the opposite shore most days, and the rocky shoreline is good for tossing stones into the water.",
            "Our home is situated in a typical residential area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Being located at the junction of two state highways, we experience a bit more traffic than we'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains mostly quiet. With a relatively stable population, I'm familiar with most of my neighbors, who generally keep to themselves and focus on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house at the end of the street allows us to see most of the neighborhood's comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars driven by our neighbors. Unusual vehicles catch our attention. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on their bikes. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. We work from home and are often outside playing, even in the rain. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the aroma of barbecue fills the air. The lawn mowing season runs from March to October, with leaves being raked and burned in the fall, which I also like as a sign of the season. The neighborhood is wooded, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf cleanup. Recent winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless expecting guests, which is uncommon. I enjoy tinkering in the garage, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, but some families visit from out of town, with extra vehicles parked on the street. All in all, I'm fond of living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the desert, where dust is abundant, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating substantial care and expense. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but the area has seen considerable development with new additions, making it increasingly urban-like. The community is generally welcoming, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is populated by friendly seniors, and the shops are mostly chain establishments, with few independent stores. The primary employment sector here is construction, given the city's undeveloped areas. I've grown fond of the unique wildlife, which includes lizards and desert insects, although I prefer this location over my previous big-city home. Victorville offers attractions like the San Bernardino County Fair and nearby snow-capped mountains, while the Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's natural history and culture.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I might describe it in a way that's a bit different. While typical answers might come from homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation is unique. My neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I live, with my dormitory residents being my community, and the surrounding campus as my extended neighborhood. While this is unconventional, my neighborhood shares some common elements with traditional neighborhoods, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the types of \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to note the three types of housing I reside in: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, rooms typically house 2-4 people with 4-6 rooms per floor, and a building can accommodate around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents. These houses are fewer in number due to their lower efficiency. Finally, dormitories are the most common housing type, with hundreds of students living in rooms meant for two people, with exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the mix of cultures and ages in my neighborhood. Professional staff tend to live in houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Moving forward, stores and parks make up the remaining aspects of my neighborhood. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from typical dining options to the school's own branded clothing and grocery stores, ensuring all necessities are available within the neighborhood. The park is a popular gathering spot for the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the neighborhood community itself.",
            "After spending roughly 10 years in this neighborhood, I can certainly share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite tough for me. I was heartbroken to leave behind my old home and friends, but my parents were eager for a better future for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered improved housing and a better high school, which was seen as a step up from what we were used to. Over the years, I adapted to my new surroundings and formed new friendships, albeit some were less than ideal. I never got to know most of my neighbors deeply, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They’ve been a source of joy and support, almost like family. I particularly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where he re-married. It was a fun and memorable event, and it got me thinking about my own future. I even caught the bride's garter! Although I didn't catch the bouquet, we all danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I haven’t seen her since but hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it more freely. I’ve only ventured a bit, mostly hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We enjoyed our time playing video games and taking life easy. Sometimes, I’d visit the park and find solace in nature, practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot and even bringing my bokken wooden sword. I also enjoy the basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a long time. My father and best friend, Mr. Graves, taught us tennis, and we always had a great time despite the rigorous training. I have plenty of happy memories here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "The college I attend is close to my neighborhood, which I enjoy for its proximity to the school. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but still offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are college students or have lower incomes, a reflection of the affordable housing. An elementary school is nearby, and my neighborhood has a mix of friendly and younger residents. My neighbors are not well-known to me, and their smoking habits have led to an air freshener unit being installed outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are mostly older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, new apartments have been constructed, although their quality is questionable, and the rent is higher than it should be due to their campus proximity. A nearby restaurant serves food on paper plates and uses microwaves, while across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. A city-funded road improvement project has made the area look nicer with a new sidewalk and landscaped medians. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although some have been removed, leaving stumps, while behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is more appealing than 43rd, which has poorly maintained sidewalks and shabby buildings. While crime is an issue in the surrounding apartment complexes, I appreciate living where I do due to its affordability and convenient amenities. The university and two bus stops are within walking distance, making it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood comprises a series of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced irregularly to mimic individual houses, the only distinct feature being their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Residents are largely friendly with one another. On some evenings, we gather at the end of an unplanned driveway, chatting as neighborhood children engage in play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing respite from our tech-savvy world, almost as if we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. The only recent challenge has been the tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens, and I found myself seeking shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road steamed as temperatures dropped from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I hurried to capture it on camera. The neighborhood remained quiet for a while, then returned to normal, with people coming home and families going about their evening routines. I appreciate this friendly community, which is like a small village. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most here. While the exteriors are similar, interiors vary, some quite small. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, seeing deer, and hearing morning rooster crowing and the evening donkey braying. It's a wonderful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood right as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but eventually, I developed strong bonds with a couple of kids living nearby. Although they no longer reside there, the memories remain. The original residents who lived here when I first moved in are still around for the most part. My neighborhood is quite typical of an average American suburb, featuring numerous two-story homes. On warm weekends, children's laughter fills the air as they play outside. Most days, the neighborhood is peaceful. I've never encountered any issues with neighbors, and the community is generally welcoming. I've ordered numerous online packages without any issues, and I trust my neighbors implicitly. A park is just a short walk from my house, where I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. Although I had a unpleasant experience there once, getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the happy memories far outweigh the bad ones. Now, I often visit the park with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes many nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many residents now prefer food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. While fast-food chains are prevalent, the area also has several pizza places and a range of stores to cater to every need. There's a dry cleaner, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood, and seeing news reports of other people's negative experiences with neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "The town of Johnston, a sleepy little place in South Carolina, isn't particularly remarkable, but it plays a substantial role in agriculture. It's renowned as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with expansive fields mainly dedicated to peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are typically two-story structures, spaced far from the road, with either metal roofs to beat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. The town's commercial center is minimal, featuring only a single stoplight at an intersection where the three main stores lie: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is the sole option for groceries, with many residents preferring to shop at a nearby Walmart. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. There's a small, community-known furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman. Attached to it is a pet grooming service, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Medical care is provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both situated away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the younger students, while middle and high school students attend schools in the next town. The town lacks parks, but a new 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to provide family activities and attract more residents. Entertainment options are limited, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or diverse dining choices. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a pleasant town, so small that one could pass through without noticing.",
            "The initial time I found out about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment around was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's due to the financial struggles. Some of my friends have mentioned that they cry themselves to sleep at night because of the expensive living costs. We've adapted to being frugal over time. You get used to the dusty scent of flea market toys and moth-eaten clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you might just be accustomed to the current situation. But the flea market persists. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It sticks in the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you wouldn't hear that noise inside the thrift stores. Regardless of the outside activity, the stores are peaceful and a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. It's the headquarters of one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, still experiencing some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really cares about you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue its rhythm like waves on a beach. It's an energetic place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always some sort of activity. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are quite kind to me. I try to keep my space clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I help with each other's mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't entirely ruined my life.",
            "The residential area where I live can be characterized as quintessential suburban living. The neighborhood is dominated by a homeowner's association, whose diligent efforts are evident in the pristine condition of the single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll find immaculate front yards, each with a small patch of greenery, decorative stones, and compact driveways. Scattered trees add to the landscaping. Every home features a two-car garage. As you navigate the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved roads, free of defects like potholes. While most homes are single-story, a few are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, located at the end of the street, with individual keys necessary for access. Larger lockers handle package deliveries. This uniformity is due to the HOA's stringent rules. My neighborhood lies at the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements. The size of the area allows for ample space, including several community pools and walking trails that ensure residents stay active without leaving the neighborhood. The community is primarily composed of retirees and is considered safe and close-knit, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is sizable but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a single mall that meets basic shopping needs. Major retail stores can be reached in about 15 minutes, making it convenient for residents to shop. The area is well-maintained and offers a high quality of life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just outside of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is typically considered the most economically challenged part of town. Here, property values are low, and many homes are rented to or owned by low-income residents. While it might not be the most aesthetically pleasing area, it's not unpleasant either. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me warmly when I walk by. Crime rates are somewhat higher than other parts of town, but they're still relatively low. There have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has fortunately not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch. The town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere that has helped him thrive despite his special needs. We have an active PTO planning events to foster family involvement and academic progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated unfairly due to their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center of town and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, our home is comfortable, and we've lived here for over 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture, perched on a hill with historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex across from an old live theater, and a few blocks down, there's a lively arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. Evenings in June and July often find people waiting in line to enter. A short distance away is a large city park, surrounded by concrete with tall steps leading up to it. During winter, particularly when it rains heavily, homeless individuals set up tents in rows along the sidewalks and steps. While snowfall is minimal, the rain can make it challenging to stay warm. Their tents, close to the city center and the nearest family center for miles, provide warmth and easy access to basic services. My affection for the city isn't for its historic architecture, though the tall buildings and rolling hills leading to the ocean are impressive. What I love about my neighborhood is the resilience and community spirit of the people. Once infamous for gang violence, Hilltop's history is still vividly recounted today. Despite the ongoing reputation, residents work hard to keep the area clean and safe. The warnings about not walking alone at night for white people recall the past, tinged with social conditioning. As someone who doesn't entirely fit the mold, I have found acceptance and kindness from the community. It's a place where night walks feel alive, with people offering help rather than harm. Laundromats stay open late to accommodate my needs, and even on the gloomiest nights, strangers show kindness, reminding me of my worth.",
            "I reside in a rural area of Michigan, specifically in a small town. Instead of big city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, you'll find farmland transitioning into small tourist destinations. My home is nestled near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you turn, there's a beach to enjoy. The neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe: older homes, some updated, others retaining their original charm, with full basements visible from the road. Many homes feature aluminum siding and yards complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect a hardworking community, with children and families at the heart. Neighbors are engaged, friendly, and maintain their properties. The area is peaceful, safe, and quiet, with green lawns and well-maintained plants. Nearby are a sheriff's department, health department, city recycling center, sports fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. My kids can bike to the park just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Some of these shops line the streets, bringing a lively atmosphere to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods. Nearby parks are popular among families with young children.

Expanding slightly beyond my immediate area reveals more diverse communities, including Little Korea, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving; a mere 10 miles may take two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most residents prefer cars over walking, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking issues. Despite this, the city has seen significant construction with new apartments being built, much to the dismay of many long-term residents who fear more congestion.

My home has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, reflecting the American dream of suburban living that once captivated our country. Though that dream seems to be waning, remnants of it remain, like my neighborhood and others, hinting at its enduring allure. While optimism and yard maintenance have declined, cars still populate driveways, and kids still play as if the world is their playground. The century-old public school still stands, inspiring both today's youth and stirring nostalgic memories in older residents. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Though each home is distinctive, they share a similar feel.

A single expressway runs through our town, with exits and entrances in the neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was rejected due to fears of ruining the neighborhood, a decision supported by the youth and opposed by the elders.

            "She inquired, \"Where is everything?\" as we cruised past the endless cornfields. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the expansiveness of the open landscape.

Regardless of how busy or distracted I become, they remain unyielding, undeterred by life's challenges. In times of stress, they call out to me, and when I look to them, they offer solace and strength, helping me carry on day by day. I moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my first captivating sight. While the university itself is a beautiful place with its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is lovely as well, with charming cafes where I spent many hours studying, and a bustling downtown area that contrasts with its quiet, small-town streets. This mix of environments creates a unique atmosphere, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories. From late-night walks in the park to movie nights in town, the town holds both joyful and painful memories. The ponds are especially conducive to reflection and quiet moments. I often found myself contemplating life's purpose while watching the creatures there. One day, as I walked past the pond and through the park, I reached a main street. The sun rose, casting its golden rays on the palm trees, and I realized I was heading north. There, I saw the mountains, their solid presence filling the sky, reigniting my resolve.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding it shouldn't be a problem—public transportation is readily available and popular throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel you're in the heart of the city. During your stay, you'll encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents, resulting in Asian-owned businesses on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common and popular among locals, offering excellent quality food at affordable prices and convenient locations. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other near where I live. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, it's diverse with immigrants and their children living here. Many large local businesses are Asian-owned. There's also a nearby park that's been recently renovated, featuring ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. The park is diverse, with people from various backgrounds getting along well. Corporate buildings aren't prevalent; instead, you'll find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and many are friendly but noisy, with frequent car noise and occasional dog waste on the streets. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's important to be cautious, as there have been incidents of bullying and package theft. I've personally experienced physical assault in the past, but these incidents are less common nowadays. Additionally, there's a lack of adherence to the city's regulations regarding dog waste, leading to a significant amount of it on the streets. Keep your shoes clean, as dog waste is a common issue in the neighborhood.",
            "In my residential area, there's a scarcity of sidewalks. The terrain slopes downward, placing my house at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, dubbed the \"work out hill\" by locals for its popularity among joggers. Lacking sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk along the road, which is rough and dangerous to drive on. Power lines and telephone wires are in disrepair, often damaged by storms and debris. Towering evergreens surround the area, but they're unpopular due to blocking ocean views, leading to many residents building houses high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are spectacular, with the water's reflection creating a glow, though it's often cloudy and damp, resulting in a moist environment where moss thrives. Children are few, and the neighborhood is primarily inhabited by elderly residents and their dogs, which are often seen in yards or on the streets. Gardens and lawns are frequently undermined by rabbits, while various birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be spotted. There are no stores nearby, but a few waterfront restaurants serve local seafood. The bay is narrow, allowing visibility of the opposite shore most days, and the rocky shoreline is good for tossing stones into the water.",
            "Our home is situated in a typical residential area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Being located at the junction of two state highways, we experience a bit more traffic than we'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains mostly quiet. With a relatively stable population, I'm familiar with most of my neighbors, who generally keep to themselves and focus on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house at the end of the street allows us to see most of the neighborhood's comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars driven by our neighbors. Unusual vehicles catch our attention. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on their bikes. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. We work from home and are often outside playing, even in the rain. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the aroma of barbecue fills the air. The lawn mowing season runs from March to October, with leaves being raked and burned in the fall, which I also like as a sign of the season. The neighborhood is wooded, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf cleanup. Recent winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless expecting guests, which is uncommon. I enjoy tinkering in the garage, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, but some families visit from out of town, with extra vehicles parked on the street. All in all, I'm fond of living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the desert, where dust is abundant, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating substantial care and expense. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but the area has seen considerable development with new additions, making it increasingly urban-like. The community is generally welcoming, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is populated by friendly seniors, and the shops are mostly chain establishments, with few independent stores. The primary employment sector here is construction, given the city's undeveloped areas. I've grown fond of the unique wildlife, which includes lizards and desert insects, although I prefer this location over my previous big-city home. Victorville offers attractions like the San Bernardino County Fair and nearby snow-capped mountains, while the Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's natural history and culture.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I might describe it in a way that's a bit different. While typical answers might come from homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation is unique. My neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I live, with my dormitory residents being my community, and the surrounding campus as my extended neighborhood. While this is unconventional, my neighborhood shares some common elements with traditional neighborhoods, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the types of \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to note the three types of housing I reside in: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, rooms typically house 2-4 people with 4-6 rooms per floor, and a building can accommodate around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents. These houses are fewer in number due to their lower efficiency. Finally, dormitories are the most common housing type, with hundreds of students living in rooms meant for two people, with exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the mix of cultures and ages in my neighborhood. Professional staff tend to live in houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Moving forward, stores and parks make up the remaining aspects of my neighborhood. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from typical dining options to the school's own branded clothing and grocery stores, ensuring all necessities are available within the neighborhood. The park is a popular gathering spot for the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the neighborhood community itself.",
            "After spending roughly 10 years in this neighborhood, I can certainly share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite tough for me. I was heartbroken to leave behind my old home and friends, but my parents were eager for a better future for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered improved housing and a better high school, which was seen as a step up from what we were used to. Over the years, I adapted to my new surroundings and formed new friendships, albeit some were less than ideal. I never got to know most of my neighbors deeply, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They’ve been a source of joy and support, almost like family. I particularly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where he re-married. It was a fun and memorable event, and it got me thinking about my own future. I even caught the bride's garter! Although I didn't catch the bouquet, we all danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I haven’t seen her since but hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it more freely. I’ve only ventured a bit, mostly hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We enjoyed our time playing video games and taking life easy. Sometimes, I’d visit the park and find solace in nature, practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot and even bringing my bokken wooden sword. I also enjoy the basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a long time. My father and best friend, Mr. Graves, taught us tennis, and we always had a great time despite the rigorous training. I have plenty of happy memories here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "The college I attend is close to my neighborhood, which I enjoy for its proximity to the school. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but still offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are college students or have lower incomes, a reflection of the affordable housing. An elementary school is nearby, and my neighborhood has a mix of friendly and younger residents. My neighbors are not well-known to me, and their smoking habits have led to an air freshener unit being installed outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are mostly older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, new apartments have been constructed, although their quality is questionable, and the rent is higher than it should be due to their campus proximity. A nearby restaurant serves food on paper plates and uses microwaves, while across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. A city-funded road improvement project has made the area look nicer with a new sidewalk and landscaped medians. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although some have been removed, leaving stumps, while behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is more appealing than 43rd, which has poorly maintained sidewalks and shabby buildings. While crime is an issue in the surrounding apartment complexes, I appreciate living where I do due to its affordability and convenient amenities. The university and two bus stops are within walking distance, making it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood comprises a series of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced irregularly to mimic individual houses, the only distinct feature being their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Residents are largely friendly with one another. On some evenings, we gather at the end of an unplanned driveway, chatting as neighborhood children engage in play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing respite from our tech-savvy world, almost as if we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. The only recent challenge has been the tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens, and I found myself seeking shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road steamed as temperatures dropped from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I hurried to capture it on camera. The neighborhood remained quiet for a while, then returned to normal, with people coming home and families going about their evening routines. I appreciate this friendly community, which is like a small village. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most here. While the exteriors are similar, interiors vary, some quite small. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, seeing deer, and hearing morning rooster crowing and the evening donkey braying. It's a wonderful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood right as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but eventually, I developed strong bonds with a couple of kids living nearby. Although they no longer reside there, the memories remain. The original residents who lived here when I first moved in are still around for the most part. My neighborhood is quite typical of an average American suburb, featuring numerous two-story homes. On warm weekends, children's laughter fills the air as they play outside. Most days, the neighborhood is peaceful. I've never encountered any issues with neighbors, and the community is generally welcoming. I've ordered numerous online packages without any issues, and I trust my neighbors implicitly. A park is just a short walk from my house, where I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. Although I had a unpleasant experience there once, getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the happy memories far outweigh the bad ones. Now, I often visit the park with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes many nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many residents now prefer food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. While fast-food chains are prevalent, the area also has several pizza places and a range of stores to cater to every need. There's a dry cleaner, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood, and seeing news reports of other people's negative experiences with neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "The town of Johnston, a sleepy little place in South Carolina, isn't particularly remarkable, but it plays a substantial role in agriculture. It's renowned as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with expansive fields mainly dedicated to peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are typically two-story structures, spaced far from the road, with either metal roofs to beat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. The town's commercial center is minimal, featuring only a single stoplight at an intersection where the three main stores lie: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is the sole option for groceries, with many residents preferring to shop at a nearby Walmart. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. There's a small, community-known furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman. Attached to it is a pet grooming service, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Medical care is provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both situated away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the younger students, while middle and high school students attend schools in the next town. The town lacks parks, but a new 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to provide family activities and attract more residents. Entertainment options are limited, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or diverse dining choices. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a pleasant town, so small that one could pass through without noticing.",
            "The initial time I found out about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment around was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's due to the financial struggles. Some of my friends have mentioned that they cry themselves to sleep at night because of the expensive living costs. We've adapted to being frugal over time. You get used to the dusty scent of flea market toys and moth-eaten clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you might just be accustomed to the current situation. But the flea market persists. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It sticks in the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you wouldn't hear that noise inside the thrift stores. Regardless of the outside activity, the stores are peaceful and a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. It's the headquarters of one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, still experiencing some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really cares about you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue its rhythm like waves on a beach. It's an energetic place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always some sort of activity. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are quite kind to me. I try to keep my space clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I help with each other's mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't entirely ruined my life.",
            "The residential area where I live can be characterized as quintessential suburban living. The neighborhood is dominated by a homeowner's association, whose diligent efforts are evident in the pristine condition of the single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll find immaculate front yards, each with a small patch of greenery, decorative stones, and compact driveways. Scattered trees add to the landscaping. Every home features a two-car garage. As you navigate the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved roads, free of defects like potholes. While most homes are single-story, a few are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, located at the end of the street, with individual keys necessary for access. Larger lockers handle package deliveries. This uniformity is due to the HOA's stringent rules. My neighborhood lies at the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements. The size of the area allows for ample space, including several community pools and walking trails that ensure residents stay active without leaving the neighborhood. The community is primarily composed of retirees and is considered safe and close-knit, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is sizable but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a single mall that meets basic shopping needs. Major retail stores can be reached in about 15 minutes, making it convenient for residents to shop. The area is well-maintained and offers a high quality of life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just outside of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is typically considered the most economically challenged part of town. Here, property values are low, and many homes are rented to or owned by low-income residents. While it might not be the most aesthetically pleasing area, it's not unpleasant either. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me warmly when I walk by. Crime rates are somewhat higher than other parts of town, but they're still relatively low. There have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has fortunately not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch. The town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere that has helped him thrive despite his special needs. We have an active PTO planning events to foster family involvement and academic progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated unfairly due to their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center of town and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, our home is comfortable, and we've lived here for over 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture, perched on a hill with historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex across from an old live theater, and a few blocks down, there's a lively arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. Evenings in June and July often find people waiting in line to enter. A short distance away is a large city park, surrounded by concrete with tall steps leading up to it. During winter, particularly when it rains heavily, homeless individuals set up tents in rows along the sidewalks and steps. While snowfall is minimal, the rain can make it challenging to stay warm. Their tents, close to the city center and the nearest family center for miles, provide warmth and easy access to basic services. My affection for the city isn't for its historic architecture, though the tall buildings and rolling hills leading to the ocean are impressive. What I love about my neighborhood is the resilience and community spirit of the people. Once infamous for gang violence, Hilltop's history is still vividly recounted today. Despite the ongoing reputation, residents work hard to keep the area clean and safe. The warnings about not walking alone at night for white people recall the past, tinged with social conditioning. As someone who doesn't entirely fit the mold, I have found acceptance and kindness from the community. It's a place where night walks feel alive, with people offering help rather than harm. Laundromats stay open late to accommodate my needs, and even on the gloomiest nights, strangers show kindness, reminding me of my worth.",
            "I reside in a rural area of Michigan, specifically in a small town. Instead of big city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, you'll find farmland transitioning into small tourist destinations. My home is nestled near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you turn, there's a beach to enjoy. The neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe: older homes, some updated, others retaining their original charm, with full basements visible from the road. Many homes feature aluminum siding and yards complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect a hardworking community, with children and families at the heart. Neighbors are engaged, friendly, and maintain their properties. The area is peaceful, safe, and quiet, with green lawns and well-maintained plants. Nearby are a sheriff's department, health department, city recycling center, sports fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. My kids can bike to the park just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, being in a large city, is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones housing numerous businesses, such as offices, stores, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, including both international chains and local boutiques. Neighborhoods are often within walking distance of parks where families with young children gather. The people in my area are also diverse, including a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish population, and former Soviet refugees. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is dotted with ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, travel within the city can be challenging due to heavy traffic, with even short distances taking hours during peak times. Most residents prefer to drive, leading to intense congestion and parking difficulties. Despite these challenges, the city has seen significant growth with new apartment buildings being constructed, although this has drawn criticism from current residents. The housing here is varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and various sizes of apartments and condominiums. The community is not very close-knit, and I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, though I recall fond memories from my childhood of playing with nearby friends.",
            "My neighborhood is unique and charming. The majority of homes are single-family dwellings, but some have been divided into two, while maintaining their connection. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a nostalgic feeling of the American dream of suburban living, which once united the country, though nowadays it seems to be fading. However, neighborhoods like mine and many others still stand as a testament to this dream, even if it's no longer as vibrant as it once was. The residents, though maybe not as optimistic as before, still maintain their homes and yards, with cars in almost every driveway and children playing as if the world is their playground. The local school, nearly a century old, still inspires the youth while stirring up memories for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its own character, yet a shared feel of history. There's a large supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide and children often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations, and they share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school now houses a pharmacy, reflecting the changing interests of the youth. An old movie theater, favored by the elderly, shows classic films at discounted prices, drawing fewer youth who prefer newer releases. The nearest expressway is just outside of town, with an exit and entrance in the neighboring town. A petition to bring the expressway to our town was supported by the youth but rejected by the elders, who feared it would ruin their locality. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a southern accent and a log cabin for our town's symbol.",

However, venture past the abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that only operate during peak seasons, and you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged neatly like Russian nesting dolls, side by side. The first set of apartments has made headlines for unsavory incidents, so they won't be the focus, as appearances can be deceiving. The complexes next to them offer a different story, one that's almost unknown to the area's residents.

Retired residents walk their dogs on the path, eyeing teenagers on skateboards and nodding to the girls by the playground. A strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a DIY frozen yogurt shop. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once - and you'll often see teens with sweet, dripping frozen yogurt cups, doing tricks on their skateboards.

            "“Where are we?” she inquired as we passed expansive fields of corn, stretching endlessly to the horizon. “This way!” I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute walk from her home; she'd never witnessed such an extent of unbroken landscape. Taken aback by the omnipresent cornfields, I recounted my upbringing in rural Ohio to her, and in that instant, she understood my origins better. On a two-lane rural road, a water-filled quarry comes into view, followed by my modest subdivision. The homes, mostly brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. In spring, vibrant flowers and the changing foliage of midwestern trees adorn the driveways, where luxury Mercedes-Benzes gleam after a thorough wash. As we draw closer to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always nearby, tending to his lawn while singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Known for his kindness and unique past as a doctor, he’s often seen as a figure of amusement for his antics but loved for his genuine nature. Continuing past him, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound, chased by our Terrier. Around back, a small stream connects to the quarry, providing a symphony of bullfrogs’ croaks, the stream’s flow, and occasional “moos” from neighboring farms. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge, an untouched sanctuary of native trees, herbs, and wildflowers awaits. This was my haven during childhood, filled with forts, imaginary hunts, and endless play opportunities. Winter in my small town can be harsh, yet the barren beauty is unparalleled. Trees shed their vibrant leaves, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland after a snowfall, where snow angels and snowmen dot the backyard. My sister and I would often clash as kids, but during winter, our weapon of choice was snowballs, building massive igloo-like forts with branches. Snowdrifts created our own magical realm, where we engaged in pretend play, free from worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is known for its eccentricity, a fact celebrated by the city's unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" emblazoned on a multi-purpose building housing a pizza shop, bar, music venue, and a strip club, all while bordering on legal gray areas. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the quirky, lesser-known Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, while to others, it's a call to embrace the city's unique spirit. Despite a growing number of affluent California transplants and new condo developments, Portland's eccentricity remains. Being weird here doesn't mean embracing everything, but it does mean accepting the unconventional. Modern amenities and controversies coexist, and while we share a reliance on Chinese imports like the rest of the country, Portland is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business types. Perhaps, weirdness here means taking it all with a lighter touch. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features vibrant houses, home gardens, and summer's free boxes, filled with discarded items waiting to be claimed by passersby. These unexpected treasures are what make Portland special to me, one of many weird possibilities. Portland is a melting pot of interests, from goat yoga and soccer matches to dream chasers and bar patrons. Substance abuse and homelessness are also issues, with mental health problems at their root, exacerbated by Portland's wet climate. Social services, while more robust than in many areas, struggle to keep up. Portland's response to homelessness is a tale of empathy and intolerance, a common human struggle.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel in the north, witnessing the sun's daily dance. Regardless of my distractions or forgetfulness, they remain steadfast and unyielding, unaffected by life's challenges. On days when I'm at my most frazzled, they seize my attention and offer a haven, providing the strength to endure, day by day. I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my initial captivation. While the university and town boast their own charms, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is a mix of bustling city and serene suburbs, with cafes, historic buildings, and parks where cherished memories are made and heartaches are reflected upon. The mountains, however, are the constant, the ever-present reminder of strength and resilience. As I've walked through the town, from the park to the library, and to the main street where the sunrise paints the sky, the mountains have been there, steadfast, inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're considering a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll easily find your way there due to its accessible public transportation, which is prevalent throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel immersed in the city's energy. During your stay, you'll notice numerous Asian stores, as the area has a significant Asian population that has grown over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are abundant and popular among locals for their quality food, low prices, and convenience. Nearby, there are multiple Asian supermarkets within walking distance. While the neighborhood is diverse, with immigrants and their offspring, most large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park offering basketball, soccer, baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain. The park's diversity reflects the neighborhood's inclusive atmosphere. Most residential buildings are co-ops or condos, with two-family houses being the majority. While the residents are generally pleasant, noise levels can be high due to frequent car noise. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with the occasional encounter with bullies or thieves. Package theft and dog waste issues are concerns, so being cautious and keeping shoes clean is advisable.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. Everything tends to slope downwards, and my home is positioned at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"workout hill\" due to the frequent joggers who climb it daily. Given the lack of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes and is somewhat treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electric wires are dilapidated and often damaged by storms, which are common in our region. There are many tall pine trees everywhere, but residents dislike them as they block the view of the ocean. Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, boasting large glass facades. Sunsets are stunning, with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, though it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows prolifically on most surfaces, including cars and railings. I once left my car unattended for a month and found it covered in moss. There are few children in the area, but many elderly residents and numerous dogs that roam freely. Rabbits are common, and while cats love hunting them, gardeners dislike them due to their destructive habits. We have a variety of bird species, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks, which are chased off by neighborhood crows. No stores are nearby, but a short walk downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. While there's no significant beach, the rocky shoreline is enjoyable for throwing rocks. The bay is narrow and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. The street where I live serves as a connector between two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, which has allowed me to become familiar with most of my neighbors. They primarily focus on yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down the nearby hill. Our house sits at the corner of our street, giving us a clear view of everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognizing the cars that frequent the area. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in regular walks, either for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on their bikes as one might expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently seen coming and going, and the neighbors have grown accustomed to our routines. We often play outside, sometimes even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck, especially during the pleasant barbecue smell it provides. The neighborhood has many trees, having been originally wooded, which offers ample shade but also an abundance of leaves in the fall that we rake and burn yearly. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves as it signals the arrival of fall. Lately, the winter has been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we use the front door infrequently except when someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, though Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visitors from out of town, with extra cars parked around. Despite the traffic from the through street, I enjoy living here.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Those who haven't lived here might not grasp the unique feeling of constant brown landscapes; a green lawn signifies a significant investment in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were far apart, but now the area has seen new developments while maintaining a similar spacious layout. It's increasingly resembling a city, but that's a common trend in many places. Most people here are friendly, though like any city, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood is peaceful and friendly, with elderly residents, and the stores are chain establishments such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. Specialty stores like Whole Foods are rare, and the dominant local job is construction due to the city's ongoing development. This change worries me; I prefer the current state of my neighborhood. I moved from a big city and dislike the idea of returning. My job involves installing drywall and T-bars in construction sites. I appreciate the varied wildlife in my area. Visitors often come for the desert's stark beauty, and residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist harmoniously. My children adore lizards and desert bugs, and they're often outside trying to catch them. For attractions, Victorville offers a unique desert experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair. Nearby Wrightwood provides snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. For those interested in the high desert's history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I must admit that my experience is quite distinct from the norm. Unlike many others who live in traditional neighborhoods with their own homes and lives, my neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I reside. My immediate community is the dormitory, and the wider neighborhood encompasses the entire campus, although to a lesser degree. Despite this unique situation, my neighborhood shares several characteristics with conventional neighborhoods. It includes housing, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's crucial to outline the types of housing present in my immediate vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory housing. In the apartments, rooms are shared by 2-4 people, with each floor containing 4-6 rooms. On average, a building can house around 20 people. The actual houses available for rent are typically 2-4 bedroom units occupied by alumni, but these are less common. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, with each room accommodating two people, although there are exceptions. With the housing situation covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. It's home to people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, new students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in my neighborhood is challenging without oversimplifying, so let's proceed to the stores and parks. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores include various dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, catering to all needs. The park is a common space for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for about a decade, I'd be happy to share some of my experiences. In the beginning, I was quite unhappy, having moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was initially homesick, but my parents wanted a better life for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered better housing and a better high school. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some acquaintances. I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who live next door. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, threw her garter, which I caught. Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but I've gotten better at navigating it now. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and exploring nature. I enjoy practicing balance and sometimes using my bokken sword at the park. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't used them in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had fun with Mr. Graves. There are many more memories, but these stand out. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "I reside near the college I attend, which I greatly appreciate. The area primarily consists of apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and affordable. One newly renamed bar is a bit pricier but offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is budget-friendly. There's a nearby elementary school, and my apartment is within walking distance. I don't know my neighbors, and I prefer it that way. They seem to smoke a lot of weed, prompting the building management to place an air freshener unit near their door - a somewhat humorous solution. The surrounding buildings are quite old but may have been renovated internally. Down the street, there are newly built apartments that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction and high rent, likely due to their proximity to the campus. Just a few minutes away, I can find an inexpensive restaurant that uses paper plates and serves mostly microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station with questionable employee satisfaction. Recent city funds have improved the road, creating a nice sidewalk and lush greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, including some stumps from recent cuts. The complexes behind my building are less visually appealing, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. The crime rate is higher on the nearby 43rd street, but I still prefer my current residence as it is affordable and offers convenient access to amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out in such a way that they appear as individual homes, with a uniform color scheme of yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most, but not all, neighbors are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not pre-planned driveway to chat as children play nearby. This simple setting feels nostalgic amidst our modern, tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds, our neighborhood is picturesque. The recent tornado warnings have been unsettling; last night, sirens startled us, prompting a rush to safety. I found myself in the bathtub with my youngest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, anxious. After the hailstorm, the road was steaming, the temperature dropping from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail quickly melted on the hot pavement. As the storm cleared, a double rainbow materialized, captivating me and my camera. The neighborhood soon returned to normal, with families going about their evening routines. Recently moved from New Hampshire, I enjoy the southern accents. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is similar to others, although the interiors vary in size. I love walking along the vast field behind my home to the non-swimmable pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs. The sounds of roosters and a donkey nearby make it feel like a small, self-contained village. I consider myself fortunate to have found this charming community near Charlotte.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was beginning eighth grade. Making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually connected with a neighbor who lived two houses down and another on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. The neighborhood's initial inhabitants are still largely present. It's quite similar to any typical American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week. I've had no issues with my neighbors, and I feel safe; no packages have ever been stolen from my porch. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of restaurants nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Many residents now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a park a short walk from my house, where I've played sports and shared memorable experiences with neighbors, including getting a bloody nose playing football. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who enjoy the playground. The park evokes nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is well-stocked with amenities, including dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a grocery store. An Indian-owned store caters to those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood, appreciating it more when I see other people's experiences with neighbors on social media and news.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming, unassuming town in South Carolina. It's not especially notable, but it plays a significant role in the state's agricultural sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with farmland covering expanses of land and housing scattered across it. Houses outside the main town area are typically two stories and have either metal roofs or gray shingles to combat the intense summer heat. They are usually set further back, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The main town area features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the town's only stores. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria operated here previously but has since closed. The town's only pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's only grocery store, although many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store that also offers delivery services. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility. Medical services are provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary office, both located away from the main town area. Johnston Elementary School is the sole educational institution in town for students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While there are no parks or recreational facilities, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or other entertainment venues, but the town is small enough to walk through in a blink of an eye.",
            "The very first time I learned about this place, I was listening to a podcast featuring stories of missing people. It was quite surprising. Nearly all the apartments in the area cost over $1,000 a month, and neither I nor any of my friends had heard of this before. Perhaps it's the struggle. I've seen friends who are so overwhelmed they cry themselves to sleep at night. While things are expensive, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. We grow accustomed to the scent of vintage toys and used clothes, which is a bit less pleasant than when we were younger. Sometimes, we start to smoke or just get used to things. Still, the flea market is a constant presence. The smell of adulthood here is like the dust from old magazines stacked on a closed piano, staying in the leather even after cleaning. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's tranquil. No matter the commotion outside, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Year after year, the area sees more growth. Cars and people fill the streets, and it's said to be a developing city, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is busy pursuing their own goals, and there's little expectation for personal involvement. You can live alone, quietly, and independently, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern is seen as caring. No one pries into others' lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you wish, and the city will coexist with you like waves receding from the shore. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a sense, we don't live among strangers, but rather in a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn, and help one another when needed. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same in return. We pass on each other's mail. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in can be characterized as a standard suburban locale. Homeowner's association rules are particularly evident here, evident in the meticulously kept single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll notice uniform front yards with small grass patches, decorative pebbles, short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every household owns a two-car garage. Throughout the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads in excellent condition, without potholes. Most homes are single-story, but a few are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there's a communal mailbox system at the end of the street, accessible with a key. The neighborhood has a few two-story structures for package deliveries. The location of my house is at the outskirts of the city, making it semi-rural and suburban. There's ample space for various activities, including multiple community pools and walking trails. The area is primarily inhabited by retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is considerable in size but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a mall that's not too large but sufficient. A 15-minute drive offers access to various stores, from high-end groceries to bargain outlets. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-maintained, and typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. While it's not immediately adjacent to any major shopping areas, it's a short car ride away from numerous big-name stores.",
            "I reside in a small town located within the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the eastern side, is often considered the economically underprivileged area of the town. Most residents are either renting or owning their homes due to lower property values. Despite this, it is not an unpleasant environment. My neighbors are generally welcoming and cordial, greeting me warmly when I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly elevated compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, the area has seen a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide within a few blocks of my residence. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not experienced direct crime impacts, only occasional minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families. Despite these challenges, the town offers many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the support team, fostering a positive atmosphere where special needs children, like my son, are well-treated and happy. The PTO organizes various annual events to boost family involvement and educational progress. With over 20% of the population living below the poverty level, the school provides free meals to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Privileges are not withheld based on affordability, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are reasonable. The City Council has made notable improvements to the town’s appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishment. Most enhancements have occurred in the central and western parts, where shopping areas and traffic are concentrated. The eastern side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention among residents. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, schools are exceptional, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home is not highly valued, it is comfortable and meets our needs. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural heritage. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theatre, and a few blocks away is an atmospheric arcade bar where diverse crowds gather on warm summer nights, often forming lines on weekends in June and July. Nearby, there's a spacious city park, though its periphery is lined with concrete and tall stairs. During winter, homeless individuals set up tents along the sidewalk and wide steps, using proximity for warmth despite little snowfall but frequent, intense rainfall. The city's past is still felt, with stories of federal efforts to clean up the neighborhood's notorious gang violence echoing through generations. The people here work hard to maintain a sense of community, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. I find solace in the culture of the people, who, despite the lingering effects of social conditioning and racism, extend kindness and generosity. I've experienced this firsthand, walking those streets at night and receiving unexpected acts of kindness. The Hilltop is home, and its spirit of resilience and community is something I carry with me wherever I go.",
            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From my home, I can venture from agricultural landscapes to small tourist destinations. There are no major city malls, no Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee's within reach. Everything is accessible by car. Yet, I live in one of the most scenic areas, bordering two lakes — Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Every direction offers a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town charm. Houses are not congested and are individually unique, many with full basements visible from the road. Some feature aluminum siding, while others are freshly painted or older, but well-maintained. Most homes have yards, complete with play structures, trampolines, gardens, and fences for pets. The neighborhood reflects the hardworking nature of its residents, who are either raising or have raised families. Daily, you'll see children playing, people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar, with a sense of belonging. Grilling in the backyard and friendly waves are common. The lawns are neatly maintained, with trimmed plants and bushes. The neighborhood is not opulent, but it exudes warmth and safety, making it an ideal place to raise a family. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. You can easily walk or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, being in a large city, is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones housing numerous businesses, such as offices, stores, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, including both international chains and local boutiques. Neighborhoods are often within walking distance of parks where families with young children gather. The people in my area are also diverse, including a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish population, and former Soviet refugees. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is dotted with ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, travel within the city can be challenging due to heavy traffic, with even short distances taking hours during peak times. Most residents prefer to drive, leading to intense congestion and parking difficulties. Despite these challenges, the city has seen significant growth with new apartment buildings being constructed, although this has drawn criticism from current residents. The housing here is varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and various sizes of apartments and condominiums. The community is not very close-knit, and I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, though I recall fond memories from my childhood of playing with nearby friends.",
            "My neighborhood is unique and charming. The majority of homes are single-family dwellings, but some have been divided into two, while maintaining their connection. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a nostalgic feeling of the American dream of suburban living, which once united the country, though nowadays it seems to be fading. However, neighborhoods like mine and many others still stand as a testament to this dream, even if it's no longer as vibrant as it once was. The residents, though maybe not as optimistic as before, still maintain their homes and yards, with cars in almost every driveway and children playing as if the world is their playground. The local school, nearly a century old, still inspires the youth while stirring up memories for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its own character, yet a shared feel of history. There's a large supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide and children often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations, and they share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school now houses a pharmacy, reflecting the changing interests of the youth. An old movie theater, favored by the elderly, shows classic films at discounted prices, drawing fewer youth who prefer newer releases. The nearest expressway is just outside of town, with an exit and entrance in the neighboring town. A petition to bring the expressway to our town was supported by the youth but rejected by the elders, who feared it would ruin their locality. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a southern accent and a log cabin for our town's symbol.",

Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged neatly like Russian nesting dolls, side by side. The first set of apartments has made headlines for unsavory incidents, so they won't be the focus, as appearances can be deceiving. The complexes next to them offer a different story, one that's almost unknown to the area's residents. Across from these complexes is a sleepy community college satellite campus, where students lazily begin their days with coffee in hand. The college road intersects with another residential area, home to a park and a rehabilitation center for people with bone injuries. The center boasts cheerful furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan, while children play in the park across the street. Retired residents walk their dogs on the path, eyeing teenagers on skateboards and nodding to the girls by the playground. A strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a DIY frozen yogurt shop. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once - and you'll often see teens with sweet, dripping frozen yogurt cups, doing tricks on their skateboards. This neighborhood is a slice of American history, unchanged by time in this quiet Southern town.",
            "“Where are we?” she inquired as we passed expansive fields of corn, stretching endlessly to the horizon. “This way!” I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute walk from her home; she'd never witnessed such an extent of unbroken landscape. Taken aback by the omnipresent cornfields, I recounted my upbringing in rural Ohio to her, and in that instant, she understood my origins better. On a two-lane rural road, a water-filled quarry comes into view, followed by my modest subdivision. The homes, mostly brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. In spring, vibrant flowers and the changing foliage of midwestern trees adorn the driveways, where luxury Mercedes-Benzes gleam after a thorough wash. As we draw closer to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always nearby, tending to his lawn while singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Known for his kindness and unique past as a doctor, he’s often seen as a figure of amusement for his antics but loved for his genuine nature. Continuing past him, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound, chased by our Terrier. Around back, a small stream connects to the quarry, providing a symphony of bullfrogs’ croaks, the stream’s flow, and occasional “moos” from neighboring farms. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge, an untouched sanctuary of native trees, herbs, and wildflowers awaits. This was my haven during childhood, filled with forts, imaginary hunts, and endless play opportunities. Winter in my small town can be harsh, yet the barren beauty is unparalleled. Trees shed their vibrant leaves, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland after a snowfall, where snow angels and snowmen dot the backyard. My sister and I would often clash as kids, but during winter, our weapon of choice was snowballs, building massive igloo-like forts with branches. Snowdrifts created our own magical realm, where we engaged in pretend play, free from worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is known for its eccentricity, a fact celebrated by the city's unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" emblazoned on a multi-purpose building housing a pizza shop, bar, music venue, and a strip club, all while bordering on legal gray areas. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the quirky, lesser-known Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, while to others, it's a call to embrace the city's unique spirit. Despite a growing number of affluent California transplants and new condo developments, Portland's eccentricity remains. Being weird here doesn't mean embracing everything, but it does mean accepting the unconventional. Modern amenities and controversies coexist, and while we share a reliance on Chinese imports like the rest of the country, Portland is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business types. Perhaps, weirdness here means taking it all with a lighter touch. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features vibrant houses, home gardens, and summer's free boxes, filled with discarded items waiting to be claimed by passersby. These unexpected treasures are what make Portland special to me, one of many weird possibilities. Portland is a melting pot of interests, from goat yoga and soccer matches to dream chasers and bar patrons. Substance abuse and homelessness are also issues, with mental health problems at their root, exacerbated by Portland's wet climate. Social services, while more robust than in many areas, struggle to keep up. Portland's response to homelessness is a tale of empathy and intolerance, a common human struggle.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel in the north, witnessing the sun's daily dance. Regardless of my distractions or forgetfulness, they remain steadfast and unyielding, unaffected by life's challenges. On days when I'm at my most frazzled, they seize my attention and offer a haven, providing the strength to endure, day by day. I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my initial captivation. While the university and town boast their own charms, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is a mix of bustling city and serene suburbs, with cafes, historic buildings, and parks where cherished memories are made and heartaches are reflected upon. The mountains, however, are the constant, the ever-present reminder of strength and resilience. As I've walked through the town, from the park to the library, and to the main street where the sunrise paints the sky, the mountains have been there, steadfast, inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're considering a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll easily find your way there due to its accessible public transportation, which is prevalent throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel immersed in the city's energy. During your stay, you'll notice numerous Asian stores, as the area has a significant Asian population that has grown over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are abundant and popular among locals for their quality food, low prices, and convenience. Nearby, there are multiple Asian supermarkets within walking distance. While the neighborhood is diverse, with immigrants and their offspring, most large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park offering basketball, soccer, baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain. The park's diversity reflects the neighborhood's inclusive atmosphere. Most residential buildings are co-ops or condos, with two-family houses being the majority. While the residents are generally pleasant, noise levels can be high due to frequent car noise. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with the occasional encounter with bullies or thieves. Package theft and dog waste issues are concerns, so being cautious and keeping shoes clean is advisable.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. Everything tends to slope downwards, and my home is positioned at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"workout hill\" due to the frequent joggers who climb it daily. Given the lack of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes and is somewhat treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electric wires are dilapidated and often damaged by storms, which are common in our region. There are many tall pine trees everywhere, but residents dislike them as they block the view of the ocean. Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, boasting large glass facades. Sunsets are stunning, with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, though it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows prolifically on most surfaces, including cars and railings. I once left my car unattended for a month and found it covered in moss. There are few children in the area, but many elderly residents and numerous dogs that roam freely. Rabbits are common, and while cats love hunting them, gardeners dislike them due to their destructive habits. We have a variety of bird species, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks, which are chased off by neighborhood crows. No stores are nearby, but a short walk downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. While there's no significant beach, the rocky shoreline is enjoyable for throwing rocks. The bay is narrow and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. The street where I live serves as a connector between two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, which has allowed me to become familiar with most of my neighbors. They primarily focus on yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down the nearby hill. Our house sits at the corner of our street, giving us a clear view of everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognizing the cars that frequent the area. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in regular walks, either for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on their bikes as one might expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently seen coming and going, and the neighbors have grown accustomed to our routines. We often play outside, sometimes even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck, especially during the pleasant barbecue smell it provides. The neighborhood has many trees, having been originally wooded, which offers ample shade but also an abundance of leaves in the fall that we rake and burn yearly. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves as it signals the arrival of fall. Lately, the winter has been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we use the front door infrequently except when someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, though Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visitors from out of town, with extra cars parked around. Despite the traffic from the through street, I enjoy living here.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Those who haven't lived here might not grasp the unique feeling of constant brown landscapes; a green lawn signifies a significant investment in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were far apart, but now the area has seen new developments while maintaining a similar spacious layout. It's increasingly resembling a city, but that's a common trend in many places. Most people here are friendly, though like any city, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood is peaceful and friendly, with elderly residents, and the stores are chain establishments such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. Specialty stores like Whole Foods are rare, and the dominant local job is construction due to the city's ongoing development. This change worries me; I prefer the current state of my neighborhood. I moved from a big city and dislike the idea of returning. My job involves installing drywall and T-bars in construction sites. I appreciate the varied wildlife in my area. Visitors often come for the desert's stark beauty, and residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist harmoniously. My children adore lizards and desert bugs, and they're often outside trying to catch them. For attractions, Victorville offers a unique desert experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair. Nearby Wrightwood provides snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. For those interested in the high desert's history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I must admit that my experience is quite distinct from the norm. Unlike many others who live in traditional neighborhoods with their own homes and lives, my neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I reside. My immediate community is the dormitory, and the wider neighborhood encompasses the entire campus, although to a lesser degree. Despite this unique situation, my neighborhood shares several characteristics with conventional neighborhoods. It includes housing, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's crucial to outline the types of housing present in my immediate vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory housing. In the apartments, rooms are shared by 2-4 people, with each floor containing 4-6 rooms. On average, a building can house around 20 people. The actual houses available for rent are typically 2-4 bedroom units occupied by alumni, but these are less common. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, with each room accommodating two people, although there are exceptions. With the housing situation covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. It's home to people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, new students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in my neighborhood is challenging without oversimplifying, so let's proceed to the stores and parks. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores include various dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, catering to all needs. The park is a common space for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for about a decade, I'd be happy to share some of my experiences. In the beginning, I was quite unhappy, having moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was initially homesick, but my parents wanted a better life for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered better housing and a better high school. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some acquaintances. I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who live next door. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, threw her garter, which I caught. Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but I've gotten better at navigating it now. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and exploring nature. I enjoy practicing balance and sometimes using my bokken sword at the park. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't used them in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had fun with Mr. Graves. There are many more memories, but these stand out. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "I reside near the college I attend, which I greatly appreciate. The area primarily consists of apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and affordable. One newly renamed bar is a bit pricier but offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is budget-friendly. There's a nearby elementary school, and my apartment is within walking distance. I don't know my neighbors, and I prefer it that way. They seem to smoke a lot of weed, prompting the building management to place an air freshener unit near their door - a somewhat humorous solution. The surrounding buildings are quite old but may have been renovated internally. Down the street, there are newly built apartments that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction and high rent, likely due to their proximity to the campus. Just a few minutes away, I can find an inexpensive restaurant that uses paper plates and serves mostly microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station with questionable employee satisfaction. Recent city funds have improved the road, creating a nice sidewalk and lush greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, including some stumps from recent cuts. The complexes behind my building are less visually appealing, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. The crime rate is higher on the nearby 43rd street, but I still prefer my current residence as it is affordable and offers convenient access to amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out in such a way that they appear as individual homes, with a uniform color scheme of yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most, but not all, neighbors are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not pre-planned driveway to chat as children play nearby. This simple setting feels nostalgic amidst our modern, tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds, our neighborhood is picturesque. The recent tornado warnings have been unsettling; last night, sirens startled us, prompting a rush to safety. I found myself in the bathtub with my youngest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, anxious. After the hailstorm, the road was steaming, the temperature dropping from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail quickly melted on the hot pavement. As the storm cleared, a double rainbow materialized, captivating me and my camera. The neighborhood soon returned to normal, with families going about their evening routines. Recently moved from New Hampshire, I enjoy the southern accents. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is similar to others, although the interiors vary in size. I love walking along the vast field behind my home to the non-swimmable pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs. The sounds of roosters and a donkey nearby make it feel like a small, self-contained village. I consider myself fortunate to have found this charming community near Charlotte.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was beginning eighth grade. Making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually connected with a neighbor who lived two houses down and another on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. The neighborhood's initial inhabitants are still largely present. It's quite similar to any typical American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week. I've had no issues with my neighbors, and I feel safe; no packages have ever been stolen from my porch. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of restaurants nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Many residents now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a park a short walk from my house, where I've played sports and shared memorable experiences with neighbors, including getting a bloody nose playing football. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who enjoy the playground. The park evokes nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is well-stocked with amenities, including dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a grocery store. An Indian-owned store caters to those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood, appreciating it more when I see other people's experiences with neighbors on social media and news.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming, unassuming town in South Carolina. It's not especially notable, but it plays a significant role in the state's agricultural sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with farmland covering expanses of land and housing scattered across it. Houses outside the main town area are typically two stories and have either metal roofs or gray shingles to combat the intense summer heat. They are usually set further back, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The main town area features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the town's only stores. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria operated here previously but has since closed. The town's only pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's only grocery store, although many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store that also offers delivery services. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility. Medical services are provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary office, both located away from the main town area. Johnston Elementary School is the sole educational institution in town for students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While there are no parks or recreational facilities, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or other entertainment venues, but the town is small enough to walk through in a blink of an eye.",
            "The very first time I learned about this place, I was listening to a podcast featuring stories of missing people. It was quite surprising. Nearly all the apartments in the area cost over $1,000 a month, and neither I nor any of my friends had heard of this before. Perhaps it's the struggle. I've seen friends who are so overwhelmed they cry themselves to sleep at night. While things are expensive, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. We grow accustomed to the scent of vintage toys and used clothes, which is a bit less pleasant than when we were younger. Sometimes, we start to smoke or just get used to things. Still, the flea market is a constant presence. The smell of adulthood here is like the dust from old magazines stacked on a closed piano, staying in the leather even after cleaning. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's tranquil. No matter the commotion outside, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Year after year, the area sees more growth. Cars and people fill the streets, and it's said to be a developing city, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is busy pursuing their own goals, and there's little expectation for personal involvement. You can live alone, quietly, and independently, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern is seen as caring. No one pries into others' lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you wish, and the city will coexist with you like waves receding from the shore. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a sense, we don't live among strangers, but rather in a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn, and help one another when needed. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same in return. We pass on each other's mail. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in can be characterized as a standard suburban locale. Homeowner's association rules are particularly evident here, evident in the meticulously kept single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll notice uniform front yards with small grass patches, decorative pebbles, short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every household owns a two-car garage. Throughout the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads in excellent condition, without potholes. Most homes are single-story, but a few are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there's a communal mailbox system at the end of the street, accessible with a key. The neighborhood has a few two-story structures for package deliveries. The location of my house is at the outskirts of the city, making it semi-rural and suburban. There's ample space for various activities, including multiple community pools and walking trails. The area is primarily inhabited by retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is considerable in size but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a mall that's not too large but sufficient. A 15-minute drive offers access to various stores, from high-end groceries to bargain outlets. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-maintained, and typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. While it's not immediately adjacent to any major shopping areas, it's a short car ride away from numerous big-name stores.",
            "I reside in a small town located within the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the eastern side, is often considered the economically underprivileged area of the town. Most residents are either renting or owning their homes due to lower property values. Despite this, it is not an unpleasant environment. My neighbors are generally welcoming and cordial, greeting me warmly when I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly elevated compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, the area has seen a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide within a few blocks of my residence. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not experienced direct crime impacts, only occasional minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families. Despite these challenges, the town offers many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the support team, fostering a positive atmosphere where special needs children, like my son, are well-treated and happy. The PTO organizes various annual events to boost family involvement and educational progress. With over 20% of the population living below the poverty level, the school provides free meals to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Privileges are not withheld based on affordability, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are reasonable. The City Council has made notable improvements to the town’s appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishment. Most enhancements have occurred in the central and western parts, where shopping areas and traffic are concentrated. The eastern side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention among residents. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, schools are exceptional, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home is not highly valued, it is comfortable and meets our needs. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural heritage. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theatre, and a few blocks away is an atmospheric arcade bar where diverse crowds gather on warm summer nights, often forming lines on weekends in June and July. Nearby, there's a spacious city park, though its periphery is lined with concrete and tall stairs. During winter, homeless individuals set up tents along the sidewalk and wide steps, using proximity for warmth despite little snowfall but frequent, intense rainfall. The city's past is still felt, with stories of federal efforts to clean up the neighborhood's notorious gang violence echoing through generations. The people here work hard to maintain a sense of community, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. I find solace in the culture of the people, who, despite the lingering effects of social conditioning and racism, extend kindness and generosity. I've experienced this firsthand, walking those streets at night and receiving unexpected acts of kindness. The Hilltop is home, and its spirit of resilience and community is something I carry with me wherever I go.",
            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From my home, I can venture from agricultural landscapes to small tourist destinations. There are no major city malls, no Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee's within reach. Everything is accessible by car. Yet, I live in one of the most scenic areas, bordering two lakes — Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Every direction offers a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town charm. Houses are not congested and are individually unique, many with full basements visible from the road. Some feature aluminum siding, while others are freshly painted or older, but well-maintained. Most homes have yards, complete with play structures, trampolines, gardens, and fences for pets. The neighborhood reflects the hardworking nature of its residents, who are either raising or have raised families. Daily, you'll see children playing, people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar, with a sense of belonging. Grilling in the backyard and friendly waves are common. The lawns are neatly maintained, with trimmed plants and bushes. The neighborhood is not opulent, but it exudes warmth and safety, making it an ideal place to raise a family. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. You can easily walk or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, being in a large city, is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones housing numerous businesses, such as offices, stores, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, including both international chains and local boutiques. Neighborhoods are often within walking distance of parks where families with young children gather. The people in my area are also diverse, including a significant LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish population, and former Soviet refugees. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is dotted with ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, travel within the city can be challenging due to heavy traffic, with even short distances taking hours during peak times. Most residents prefer to drive, leading to intense congestion and parking difficulties. Despite these challenges, the city has seen significant growth with new apartment buildings being constructed, although this has drawn criticism from current residents. The housing here is varied, with single-family homes, duplexes, and various sizes of apartments and condominiums. The community is not very close-knit, and I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, though I recall fond memories from my childhood of playing with nearby friends.",
            "My neighborhood is unique and charming. The majority of homes are single-family dwellings, but some have been divided into two, while maintaining their connection. My house has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, like many others, evokes a nostalgic feeling of the American dream of suburban living, which once united the country, though nowadays it seems to be fading. However, neighborhoods like mine and many others still stand as a testament to this dream, even if it's no longer as vibrant as it once was. The residents, though maybe not as optimistic as before, still maintain their homes and yards, with cars in almost every driveway and children playing as if the world is their playground. The local school, nearly a century old, still inspires the youth while stirring up memories for the elders. The churches are sparse and often empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its own character, yet a shared feel of history. There's a large supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide and children often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many residents have been here for generations, and they share stories of a time when everyone knew everyone. A former karate school now houses a pharmacy, reflecting the changing interests of the youth. An old movie theater, favored by the elderly, shows classic films at discounted prices, drawing fewer youth who prefer newer releases. The nearest expressway is just outside of town, with an exit and entrance in the neighboring town. A petition to bring the expressway to our town was supported by the youth but rejected by the elders, who feared it would ruin their locality. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a southern accent and a log cabin for our town's symbol.",

However, venture past the abandoned Whole Foods and the hotels that only operate during peak seasons, and you'll discover a thriving community. Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged neatly like Russian nesting dolls, side by side. The first set of apartments has made headlines for unsavory incidents, so they won't be the focus, as appearances can be deceiving. The complexes next to them offer a different story, one that's almost unknown to the area's residents. Across from these complexes is a sleepy community college satellite campus, where students lazily begin their days with coffee in hand. The college road intersects with another residential area, home to a park and a rehabilitation center for people with bone injuries. The center boasts cheerful furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan, while children play in the park across the street. Retired residents walk their dogs on the path, eyeing teenagers on skateboards and nodding to the girls by the playground. A strip mall nearby houses a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a DIY frozen yogurt shop. You can fill your pool, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once - and you'll often see teens with sweet, dripping frozen yogurt cups, doing tricks on their skateboards. This neighborhood is a slice of American history, unchanged by time in this quiet Southern town.",
            "“Where are we?” she inquired as we passed expansive fields of corn, stretching endlessly to the horizon. “This way!” I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was a mere 5-minute walk from her home; she'd never witnessed such an extent of unbroken landscape. Taken aback by the omnipresent cornfields, I recounted my upbringing in rural Ohio to her, and in that instant, she understood my origins better. On a two-lane rural road, a water-filled quarry comes into view, followed by my modest subdivision. The homes, mostly brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. In spring, vibrant flowers and the changing foliage of midwestern trees adorn the driveways, where luxury Mercedes-Benzes gleam after a thorough wash. As we draw closer to my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always nearby, tending to his lawn while singing over the hum of his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Known for his kindness and unique past as a doctor, he’s often seen as a figure of amusement for his antics but loved for his genuine nature. Continuing past him, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese abound, chased by our Terrier. Around back, a small stream connects to the quarry, providing a symphony of bullfrogs’ croaks, the stream’s flow, and occasional “moos” from neighboring farms. Crossing the handmade wooden bridge, an untouched sanctuary of native trees, herbs, and wildflowers awaits. This was my haven during childhood, filled with forts, imaginary hunts, and endless play opportunities. Winter in my small town can be harsh, yet the barren beauty is unparalleled. Trees shed their vibrant leaves, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland after a snowfall, where snow angels and snowmen dot the backyard. My sister and I would often clash as kids, but during winter, our weapon of choice was snowballs, building massive igloo-like forts with branches. Snowdrifts created our own magical realm, where we engaged in pretend play, free from worries.",
            "Portland, Oregon, is known for its eccentricity, a fact celebrated by the city's unofficial motto, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" emblazoned on a multi-purpose building housing a pizza shop, bar, music venue, and a strip club, all while bordering on legal gray areas. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the quirky, lesser-known Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, while to others, it's a call to embrace the city's unique spirit. Despite a growing number of affluent California transplants and new condo developments, Portland's eccentricity remains. Being weird here doesn't mean embracing everything, but it does mean accepting the unconventional. Modern amenities and controversies coexist, and while we share a reliance on Chinese imports like the rest of the country, Portland is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business types. Perhaps, weirdness here means taking it all with a lighter touch. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features vibrant houses, home gardens, and summer's free boxes, filled with discarded items waiting to be claimed by passersby. These unexpected treasures are what make Portland special to me, one of many weird possibilities. Portland is a melting pot of interests, from goat yoga and soccer matches to dream chasers and bar patrons. Substance abuse and homelessness are also issues, with mental health problems at their root, exacerbated by Portland's wet climate. Social services, while more robust than in many areas, struggle to keep up. Portland's response to homelessness is a tale of empathy and intolerance, a common human struggle.",
            "The mountains have always been there, standing sentinel in the north, witnessing the sun's daily dance. Regardless of my distractions or forgetfulness, they remain steadfast and unyielding, unaffected by life's challenges. On days when I'm at my most frazzled, they seize my attention and offer a haven, providing the strength to endure, day by day. I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my initial captivation. While the university and town boast their own charms, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is a mix of bustling city and serene suburbs, with cafes, historic buildings, and parks where cherished memories are made and heartaches are reflected upon. The mountains, however, are the constant, the ever-present reminder of strength and resilience. As I've walked through the town, from the park to the library, and to the main street where the sunrise paints the sky, the mountains have been there, steadfast, inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you're considering a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll easily find your way there due to its accessible public transportation, which is prevalent throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel immersed in the city's energy. During your stay, you'll notice numerous Asian stores, as the area has a significant Asian population that has grown over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are abundant and popular among locals for their quality food, low prices, and convenience. Nearby, there are multiple Asian supermarkets within walking distance. While the neighborhood is diverse, with immigrants and their offspring, most large and popular businesses are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park offering basketball, soccer, baseball, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain. The park's diversity reflects the neighborhood's inclusive atmosphere. Most residential buildings are co-ops or condos, with two-family houses being the majority. While the residents are generally pleasant, noise levels can be high due to frequent car noise. Nighttime can be unpredictable, with the occasional encounter with bullies or thieves. Package theft and dog waste issues are concerns, so being cautious and keeping shoes clean is advisable.",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are scarce. Everything tends to slope downwards, and my home is positioned at the highest point of the steepest hill. Locals refer to it as the \"workout hill\" due to the frequent joggers who climb it daily. Given the lack of sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has a few potholes and is somewhat treacherous to drive on. The telephone and electric wires are dilapidated and often damaged by storms, which are common in our region. There are many tall pine trees everywhere, but residents dislike them as they block the view of the ocean. Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, boasting large glass facades. Sunsets are stunning, with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, though it's often cloudy and damp. Moss grows prolifically on most surfaces, including cars and railings. I once left my car unattended for a month and found it covered in moss. There are few children in the area, but many elderly residents and numerous dogs that roam freely. Rabbits are common, and while cats love hunting them, gardeners dislike them due to their destructive habits. We have a variety of bird species, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks, which are chased off by neighborhood crows. No stores are nearby, but a short walk downhill leads to a few waterfront restaurants serving fresh seafood. While there's no significant beach, the rocky shoreline is enjoyable for throwing rocks. The bay is narrow and the opposite shore is visible through the mist on most days.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area of a small southern town in Tennessee. The street where I live serves as a connector between two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, which has allowed me to become familiar with most of my neighbors. They primarily focus on yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down the nearby hill. Our house sits at the corner of our street, giving us a clear view of everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognizing the cars that frequent the area. Whenever we spot an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors engage in regular walks, either for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on their bikes as one might expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently seen coming and going, and the neighbors have grown accustomed to our routines. We often play outside, sometimes even in the rain, and enjoy grilling on our back deck, especially during the pleasant barbecue smell it provides. The neighborhood has many trees, having been originally wooded, which offers ample shade but also an abundance of leaves in the fall that we rake and burn yearly. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves as it signals the arrival of fall. Lately, the winter has been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is located at the back of our house, so we use the front door infrequently except when someone knocks, which is rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, the neighborhood is relatively quiet, though Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visitors from out of town, with extra cars parked around. Despite the traffic from the through street, I enjoy living here.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by dirt and more dirt. Those who haven't lived here might not grasp the unique feeling of constant brown landscapes; a green lawn signifies a significant investment in lawn care. In the 90s, houses were far apart, but now the area has seen new developments while maintaining a similar spacious layout. It's increasingly resembling a city, but that's a common trend in many places. Most people here are friendly, though like any city, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood is peaceful and friendly, with elderly residents, and the stores are chain establishments such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. Specialty stores like Whole Foods are rare, and the dominant local job is construction due to the city's ongoing development. This change worries me; I prefer the current state of my neighborhood. I moved from a big city and dislike the idea of returning. My job involves installing drywall and T-bars in construction sites. I appreciate the varied wildlife in my area. Visitors often come for the desert's stark beauty, and residents should learn about the wildlife to coexist harmoniously. My children adore lizards and desert bugs, and they're often outside trying to catch them. For attractions, Victorville offers a unique desert experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair. Nearby Wrightwood provides snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. For those interested in the high desert's history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I must admit that my experience is quite distinct from the norm. Unlike many others who live in traditional neighborhoods with their own homes and lives, my neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I reside. My immediate community is the dormitory, and the wider neighborhood encompasses the entire campus, although to a lesser degree. Despite this unique situation, my neighborhood shares several characteristics with conventional neighborhoods. It includes housing, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's crucial to outline the types of housing present in my immediate vicinity. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory housing. In the apartments, rooms are shared by 2-4 people, with each floor containing 4-6 rooms. On average, a building can house around 20 people. The actual houses available for rent are typically 2-4 bedroom units occupied by alumni, but these are less common. Finally, there are the dorm rooms, which house hundreds of students, with each room accommodating two people, although there are exceptions. With the housing situation covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the makeup of my neighborhood. It's home to people from various cultures and age groups. Professional staff tend to live in the houses, new students in dormitories, and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in my neighborhood is challenging without oversimplifying, so let's proceed to the stores and parks. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a wide range of stores and a single park. The stores include various dining options and the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, catering to all needs. The park is a common space for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all its members!",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for about a decade, I'd be happy to share some of my experiences. In the beginning, I was quite unhappy, having moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was initially homesick, but my parents wanted a better life for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered better housing and a better high school. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and even some acquaintances. I've grown close to Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who live next door. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where his new wife, Ms. Veda, threw her garter, which I caught. Sadly, I missed the bouquet. We all danced the night away, and I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is like a labyrinth, but I've gotten better at navigating it now. I've spent time with friends like Kason and Curtis, playing video games and exploring nature. I enjoy practicing balance and sometimes using my bokken sword at the park. There's also a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't used them in a while. My dad taught me tennis, and we always had fun with Mr. Graves. There are many more memories, but these stand out. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "I reside near the college I attend, which I greatly appreciate. The area primarily consists of apartment buildings, but there are some restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and affordable. One newly renamed bar is a bit pricier but offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is budget-friendly. There's a nearby elementary school, and my apartment is within walking distance. I don't know my neighbors, and I prefer it that way. They seem to smoke a lot of weed, prompting the building management to place an air freshener unit near their door - a somewhat humorous solution. The surrounding buildings are quite old but may have been renovated internally. Down the street, there are newly built apartments that I find unappealing due to their shoddy construction and high rent, likely due to their proximity to the campus. Just a few minutes away, I can find an inexpensive restaurant that uses paper plates and serves mostly microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station with questionable employee satisfaction. Recent city funds have improved the road, creating a nice sidewalk and lush greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment complex is surrounded by trees, including some stumps from recent cuts. The complexes behind my building are less visually appealing, with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. The crime rate is higher on the nearby 43rd street, but I still prefer my current residence as it is affordable and offers convenient access to amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out in such a way that they appear as individual homes, with a uniform color scheme of yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most, but not all, neighbors are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of the not pre-planned driveway to chat as children play nearby. This simple setting feels nostalgic amidst our modern, tech-filled world. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds, our neighborhood is picturesque. The recent tornado warnings have been unsettling; last night, sirens startled us, prompting a rush to safety. I found myself in the bathtub with my youngest dog, purse, and pillows, while my bigger dog stayed in the living room, anxious. After the hailstorm, the road was steaming, the temperature dropping from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. The hail quickly melted on the hot pavement. As the storm cleared, a double rainbow materialized, captivating me and my camera. The neighborhood soon returned to normal, with families going about their evening routines. Recently moved from New Hampshire, I enjoy the southern accents. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is similar to others, although the interiors vary in size. I love walking along the vast field behind my home to the non-swimmable pond, where I've seen deer and heard bullfrogs. The sounds of roosters and a donkey nearby make it feel like a small, self-contained village. I consider myself fortunate to have found this charming community near Charlotte.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was beginning eighth grade. Making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually connected with a neighbor who lived two houses down and another on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. The neighborhood's initial inhabitants are still largely present. It's quite similar to any typical American suburban area, filled with two-story houses. On warm weekends, I hear kids playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week. I've had no issues with my neighbors, and I feel safe; no packages have ever been stolen from my porch. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of restaurants nearby, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. Many residents now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. There's a park a short walk from my house, where I've played sports and shared memorable experiences with neighbors, including getting a bloody nose playing football. Now, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger kids, who enjoy the playground. The park evokes nostalgic feelings. The neighborhood is well-stocked with amenities, including dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a grocery store. An Indian-owned store caters to those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood, appreciating it more when I see other people's experiences with neighbors on social media and news.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming, unassuming town in South Carolina. It's not especially notable, but it plays a significant role in the state's agricultural sector. Johnston is renowned as the Peach Capital of the World, a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with farmland covering expanses of land and housing scattered across it. Houses outside the main town area are typically two stories and have either metal roofs or gray shingles to combat the intense summer heat. They are usually set further back, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or livestock. The main town area features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where you'll find the town's only stores. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria operated here previously but has since closed. The town's only pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the town's only grocery store, although many residents prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small, well-known furniture store that also offers delivery services. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming and boarding facility. Medical services are provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary office, both located away from the main town area. Johnston Elementary School is the sole educational institution in town for students up to fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While there are no parks or recreational facilities, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or other entertainment venues, but the town is small enough to walk through in a blink of an eye.",
            "The very first time I learned about this place, I was listening to a podcast featuring stories of missing people. It was quite surprising. Nearly all the apartments in the area cost over $1,000 a month, and neither I nor any of my friends had heard of this before. Perhaps it's the struggle. I've seen friends who are so overwhelmed they cry themselves to sleep at night. While things are expensive, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. We grow accustomed to the scent of vintage toys and used clothes, which is a bit less pleasant than when we were younger. Sometimes, we start to smoke or just get used to things. Still, the flea market is a constant presence. The smell of adulthood here is like the dust from old magazines stacked on a closed piano, staying in the leather even after cleaning. There are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's tranquil. No matter the commotion outside, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Year after year, the area sees more growth. Cars and people fill the streets, and it's said to be a developing city, with one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is busy pursuing their own goals, and there's little expectation for personal involvement. You can live alone, quietly, and independently, and people won't bother you. It's not like the South, where showing concern is seen as caring. No one pries into others' lives here. You can keep to yourself as much as you wish, and the city will coexist with you like waves receding from the shore. It's a vibrant place to be. Between the pianist next door and the amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. In a sense, we don't live among strangers, but rather in a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn, and help one another when needed. I feel lucky to be here. I get along with most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same in return. We pass on each other's mail. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in can be characterized as a standard suburban locale. Homeowner's association rules are particularly evident here, evident in the meticulously kept single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll notice uniform front yards with small grass patches, decorative pebbles, short driveways, and occasional small trees. Every household owns a two-car garage. Throughout the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads in excellent condition, without potholes. Most homes are single-story, but a few are two-story. Instead of individual mailboxes, there's a communal mailbox system at the end of the street, accessible with a key. The neighborhood has a few two-story structures for package deliveries. The location of my house is at the outskirts of the city, making it semi-rural and suburban. There's ample space for various activities, including multiple community pools and walking trails. The area is primarily inhabited by retirees, but there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city is considerable in size but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a mall that's not too large but sufficient. A 15-minute drive offers access to various stores, from high-end groceries to bargain outlets. In summary, my neighborhood is secure, well-maintained, and typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. While it's not immediately adjacent to any major shopping areas, it's a short car ride away from numerous big-name stores.",
            "I reside in a small town located within the suburban outskirts of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the eastern side, is often considered the economically underprivileged area of the town. Most residents are either renting or owning their homes due to lower property values. Despite this, it is not an unpleasant environment. My neighbors are generally welcoming and cordial, greeting me warmly when I walk down the street. While crime rates are slightly elevated compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, the area has seen a few violent crimes, including shootings and a homicide within a few blocks of my residence. Unfortunately, our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not experienced direct crime impacts, only occasional minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost due to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families. Despite these challenges, the town offers many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the support team, fostering a positive atmosphere where special needs children, like my son, are well-treated and happy. The PTO organizes various annual events to boost family involvement and educational progress. With over 20% of the population living below the poverty level, the school provides free meals to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Privileges are not withheld based on affordability, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are reasonable. The City Council has made notable improvements to the town’s appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park refurbishment. Most enhancements have occurred in the central and western parts, where shopping areas and traffic are concentrated. The eastern side, where I live, often feels neglected, which is a point of contention among residents. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here. The community is generally friendly, schools are exceptional, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home is not highly valued, it is comfortable and meets our needs. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot see ourselves living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in cultural heritage. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building across from an old live theatre, and a few blocks away is an atmospheric arcade bar where diverse crowds gather on warm summer nights, often forming lines on weekends in June and July. Nearby, there's a spacious city park, though its periphery is lined with concrete and tall stairs. During winter, homeless individuals set up tents along the sidewalk and wide steps, using proximity for warmth despite little snowfall but frequent, intense rainfall. The city's past is still felt, with stories of federal efforts to clean up the neighborhood's notorious gang violence echoing through generations. The people here work hard to maintain a sense of community, despite the neighborhood's rough reputation. I find solace in the culture of the people, who, despite the lingering effects of social conditioning and racism, extend kindness and generosity. I've experienced this firsthand, walking those streets at night and receiving unexpected acts of kindness. The Hilltop is home, and its spirit of resilience and community is something I carry with me wherever I go.",
            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From my home, I can venture from agricultural landscapes to small tourist destinations. There are no major city malls, no Wal-marts, Targets, or Applebee's within reach. Everything is accessible by car. Yet, I live in one of the most scenic areas, bordering two lakes — Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Every direction offers a beach for a quick dip. My neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town charm. Houses are not congested and are individually unique, many with full basements visible from the road. Some feature aluminum siding, while others are freshly painted or older, but well-maintained. Most homes have yards, complete with play structures, trampolines, gardens, and fences for pets. The neighborhood reflects the hardworking nature of its residents, who are either raising or have raised families. Daily, you'll see children playing, people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar, with a sense of belonging. Grilling in the backyard and friendly waves are common. The lawns are neatly maintained, with trimmed plants and bushes. The neighborhood is not opulent, but it exudes warmth and safety, making it an ideal place to raise a family. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, a small-town airport, and an ice cream shop. You can easily walk or bike to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It's a fantastic place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the sprawling metropolis where I reside, my neighborhood is an amalgam of diverse areas. Residential zones intermingle haphazardly with commercial districts, housing a myriad of businesses from corporate offices to independent stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Dining and shopping options are plentiful, ranging from big-name brands to trendy boutiques, which are scattered throughout the streets and malls. Several parks nearby are frequented by families with young children. My neighborhood boasts a vibrant mix of people, including a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and a contingent of former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants. Further afield, the city is home to distinct enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, each a few miles away but making for a lengthy commute due to traffic. With a vast cityscape, residents rarely walk, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking difficulties. Despite this, recent years have seen a surge in construction, with new apartment buildings popping up, much to the dismay of residents concerned about increased population and vehicle traffic. Housing options vary widely, from single-family homes to duplexes and small apartment buildings. Neighborhood dynamics reflect this diversity, with residents of all ages, including many I do not personally know. While I recall fond memories of childhood play with nearby friends, the neighborhood today is more diverse and less tightly-knit.",
            "My neighborhood is unique. While most of the houses are single-family homes, there are some that have been divided into two connected units. My home has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, along with many others, evokes a sense of a not-too-distant past where suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation, but its appeal is waning. However, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, clinging to it despite the changing times. The residents, though no longer as optimistic as before, maintain a sense of community. While the upkeep of the yards has declined, every driveway still has a car, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The public school, with a history spanning nearly a century, still stands as a symbol of the future for the youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. Though churches are sparse and often empty, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home has its own character, but collectively they convey a sense of unity. A large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, is the only Arab establishment in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing to let cars pass. Many residents have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew everyone. There was once a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate-themed films, it closed, and now a pharmacy stands in its place. A small theater screens old movies at a discounted price, attracting elders who view it as a reasonable night out without the children. A single expressway passes through our town, with its entrance and exit in the neighboring town. There was a proposal to move the exit to our town, but the youth supported it while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin the town's character. They convinced the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being built, and we're discussing a mascot for our town. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the perfect representation of our town.",
            "It might be easy to overlook this area from the outside - it's behind a shopping center and seems more like a residential backwater than a place where people live. Beyond the old, deserted Whole Foods store and the hotels that are mostly empty except for a few summer visits, you'll find a vibrant, hidden community. This community is home to a series of apartment complexes, stacked together like a row of carefully dismantled Russian nesting dolls. The nearby community college satellite campus is a tranquil, sleepy place where students start their days with coffee, while locals and commuters exchange grumbles. Turning off onto a residential road, you'll find a park and a rehabilitation center with cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan. Children play in the park, elderly residents walk their dogs, and teenagers gather at the playground, discussing the latest trends. A strip mall nearby offers affordable food options and a variety of shops, including a DIY frozen yogurt place. This neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana, unchanged even by time.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we drove past the expansive cornfields stretching out as far as the eye could see. “This is my place!” I exclaimed, knowing she'd be surprised by the vast openness. She came from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never experienced this much open space before. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of cornfields, I shared my childhood memories of rural Ohio with her, and in that moment, she finally understood my roots. As we drove along a winding two-lane road, we passed a quarry filled with water, just before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, with each one sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. During springtime, blooming flowers and the changing midwestern trees make the neighborhood come alive. The driveways are lined with luxurious Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approached my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was always outside, always ready with a friendly smile. He enjoyed spending his day mowing his lawn, often humming a tune over the mower's whirr. Everyone in the neighborhood found his constant presence amusing, but he was always genuine and had an intriguing past. He used to be a doctor and could often be mistaken for a part of the landscape with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we reached my home. Geese were abundant in the side yard, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, where you could hear bullfrogs croaking, the stream flowing, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was here that I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which usually meant chasing them. There was always something to do, and a friend nearby. The winters in my small town could be harsh, but they were also incredibly beautiful. The green yard transformed into a barren wilderness, and the vibrantly colored trees became bare skeletons of bark. Snowfall turned the backyard into a winter wonderland, with snow angels and snowmen left by my little sister. Snowballs were our favorite weapons, and we'd build massive igloo-like forts for our arsenal. During these cold winter days, we'd pretend in our own little wonderland, untouched by the cares of the world.",
            "Portland is renowned for its quirkiness, as encapsulated in the unofficial motto \"Keep Portland Weird,\" embossed on a building that serves multiple purposes, including pizza parlor, bar, music venue, and strip club, while often flirting with legal boundaries. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic call to the Portland of yesteryears, when it was less known and less costly, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it beckons them to come and find acceptance for their quirks, as Portland continues to embrace the unusual despite the influx of wealthy Californians and ongoing condominium construction. Portland’s weirdness isn’t about acceptance of everything, but it is open to the unconventional. It's a city where people take yoga with goats and cheer for the soccer team, and where you might find unexpected treasures in free boxes along the roadside. However, Portland also grapples with drug and homelessness issues, exacerbated by its rainy climate and social service limitations. Residents range from those who embrace this unconventional lifestyle to those who struggle to find a balance between care and intolerance. Despite these challenges, Portland remains a city where people passionately pursue their dreams, often with a healthy dose of whimsy.",
            "The mountains have been a constant presence, observing the sunrise and sunset each day. Despite my forgetfulness or preoccupation with life and work, they remain steadfast, unchanging, and undisturbed by life's challenges. On days when I'm most stressed, they remind me to look up and find solace, giving me strength to face the day. When I first moved here for my undergrad, the mountains north of campus were what initially captivated me. While the university offers its own impressive scenes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with charming cafes and a downtown area filled with historic buildings. This town, despite its small-town feel, has its own urban bustle, and the serene atmosphere can be found just beyond the library. The striking contrast of environments creates a unique charm that invites exploration and memory-making, from late-night walks in the park with friends to catching a movie downtown. However, it also holds unhappy memories, as all places do. The ponds, in particular, can be a place of introspection and late-night tears. As I watched the creatures living their lives, I wondered about my own purpose and walked along the main street, where the sunrise illuminated the palm trees, leading me north. The mountains, ever-present and tall, stood out against the horizon, inspiring a sense of determination within me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll find it easy to get to, thanks to the city's excellent public transportation system, which is very popular among residents. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in New York City. During your visit, you'll come across numerous Asian stores; in fact, the neighborhood has seen a significant increase in Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are prevalent and highly regarded for their quality and affordability. Near my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping convenient. While Bensonhurst is diverse with immigrants and their American-born children, many businesses are Asian-owned. The neighborhood also features a recently renovated park with basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. Despite the noise from cars and the occasional package theft, Bensonhurst is generally safe. However, be cautious, especially at night. There's also an issue with dog waste on the streets. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and the terrain slopes downwards, with my house situated at the peak of the steepest hill. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to the popularity of joggers training on it. The road is rough and hazardous, with potholes and disrepair, while overhead telephone and electrical wires are often damaged and patched up following frequent storms. Dense evergreen trees surround the area, though locals dislike them because they block the ocean view, leading to houses built high up the hill. At sunset, the bay lights up with a beautiful orange glow, but it's often cloudy and damp, with moss growing on various surfaces. Few children reside here; instead, old folks and retired people populate the community, often accompanied by dogs. Larger-than-average rabbits roam freely, causing issues for gardeners, but cats hunt them. Birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles (chased off by crows), are common. Stores are scarce, but a few restaurants offering fresh seafood are found near the waterfront. The bay is narrow, and you can easily see the opposite shore.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town of Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, resulting in more traffic than desired, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's minimal turnover among residents, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with our neighbors. Most individuals spend their time on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, and our house's front corner location affords us a view of everyone coming and going. We're accustomed to seeing familiar cars and take note of any new ones. Neighbors engage in activities like walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on bikes. As a family of four—myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen—we're often at home due to our remote work setup. We enjoy outdoor play, even in the rain, and occasionally grill outside, filling the neighborhood with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowing is a common sound from March through October. Our neighborhood has many trees, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf raking and burning in fall. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. The recent mild winters have extended the fall season. Our garage is at the back, so we mainly use the front door for visitors, which are rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage doors are open. During holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for visitors from out of town. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, where dirt is prevalent. Except for those who have actually lived here, the feeling of seeing brown landscapes most of the time is hard to comprehend. When a green lawn is spotted, it indicates considerable efforts and expense on lawn care. In the 1990s, residential houses were scattered far apart, but now, while the layout remains similar, there are many new additions. The area is transforming into a city, though this may be a common trend. Generally, residents are friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my area, I am surrounded by friendly elderly people, making it a pleasant neighborhood. Stores are mostly chain retailers, with few local independent options. The prominent industry in this city is construction, due to the vast undeveloped spaces. While I appreciate the natural beauty, I worry about the ongoing development. Having moved from a large city, I'm not eager to return. My full-time job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. I enjoy the diverse wildlife here. People visit the high desert for its stark beauty and unique ecosystems, which house various animals. It's essential for residents to learn about these non-human inhabitants for safe coexistence. My children are fascinated by the local wildlife, especially lizards and desert insects. Attractions include the nearby Wrightwood's snow-covered mountains and the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which offers diverse activities. For those interested in natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological, paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, my response is somewhat unique. Unlike others who live in the area, I reside on a college campus and consider it my primary neighborhood. The people living in my dormitory make up my community, and while the broader campus is also part of my neighborhood, it plays a secondary role. Despite this unconventional perspective, my neighborhood shares common features with more traditional ones, including homes, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"homes\" in my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it's important to note the types of housing present. There are three main types: apartments, traditional houses, and dormitories. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common apartment buildings can house around 20 people. Traditional houses are available to rent by those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents, but these are fewer in number and less efficient. Dormitories are the most common type of housing, with each room housing two people, and hundreds of students living on campus. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the cultural and age diversity of my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the traditional houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in this neighborhood would be insufficient, so let's move on to the stores and parks. As the campus is self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options found elsewhere, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, making it convenient for all needs. The park is a communal space for the diverse residents, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "I've been living here for nearly a decade, so I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite disheartened when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was homesick and missed my old neighborhood deeply, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we relocated to a more affluent area. Over time, I adapted and made new friends, some of whom remain my acquaintances now. I barely interacted with my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived next door. They were always friendly, and I consider them like family. I recall my parents, sister, and I attended Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a memorable and enjoyable event. I caught his wife's bouquet, even if only part of it! We danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is a bit confusing, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only ventured so far, where I hang out with Kason and Curtis. We used to spend a lot of time playing video games and enjoying life. I also like going to the park to connect with nature, which helps me relax. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken sword if I have it. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played there in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard but always had fun. I've had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and I believe the best times are yet to come!",
            "I live close to the college I attend, which I appreciate. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are both enjoyable and affordable. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit pricier, yet it still offers decent service and drinks. The residents are mostly college students or lower-income individuals due to the affordable housing. There's an elementary school nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors personally, they generally seem pleasant. They tend to smoke marijuana, and the building management has placed an air freshener unit near their doors, which I found amusing. The surrounding buildings are usually older but may have modern interiors. Just down the road, there are newer apartment complexes that, while built cheaply, command high rents due to their proximity to campus. A nearby eatery serves food on paper plates, using a microwave, and across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. The road was recently improved by the city, with sidewalks and landscaping added, enhancing the area. The building I live in is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps left behind after some were cut down. There are more trees on my street than down the road, and the sidewalks on 43rd Street are in poor condition, with many shabby buildings. Crime has occurred in the nearby apartment complexes, but I find my current residence affordable and convenient, with useful amenities nearby and the university within walking distance. The bus stops and walkability to the store and downtown make it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is composed of a series of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, giving the appearance of individual homes. The only distinguishing feature is their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. We're like a tightly-knit community; most everyone is friends with one another. In the evenings, we socialize at the end of a shared driveway while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from our tech-filled world, reminiscent of stepping back in time. Our neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds, but there's a downside - we've been experiencing tornado warnings. Recently, we heard sirens and took shelter. I huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming, and we went from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. Hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped pictures to share, amazed by the sight. The streets remained quiet for an hour before people returned from wherever they'd been during the storm. Life returned to normal with moms and children outside while dinner was cooked. I love this friendly neighborhood, where I've recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most others, but the interiors vary in size. I enjoy walking along the biggest field behind my home to the pond, where I've seen deer and heard giant bullfrogs in the morning. It's like living in a small community village, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets us know he's there with his bray. I consider myself fortunate to have found this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood as I was about to begin eighth grade. While it was challenging to befriend others initially, I eventually connected with a couple of kids nearby: one who lived two houses down and another who lived on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories of our friendship remain. Many of the original inhabitants still live in the neighborhood, which is quite typical of a standard American suburban area. The neighborhood is characterized by two-story houses and is generally quiet, with the exception of weekends or warm days when children play outside. I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors, and I feel secure knowing that I can rely on them if needed. I've never experienced any porch package thefts, which gives me confidence in my neighbors' trustworthiness. A park situated a short distance from my house holds many fond memories for me. I've played various sports there with neighborhood friends, though one of my worst experiences involved getting injured while playing football. Despite this, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger children. They always enjoy going there, and the park evokes nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering numerous food options within a mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The neighborhood also offers various stores that cater to everyday needs, with a range of ethnic-owned establishments. I'm content with my neighborhood, as I see and read about the struggles other people face with their neighbors on social media and the news.",
            "Our village is charming and ordinary, much like the rest of South Carolina, but it's a significant player in the agriculture industry. Johnston is proudly known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a claim it displays on its welcoming sign. The town is predominantly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle farms. Houses outside of the main town area are scattered and mainly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs. They are often situated farther back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or grazing. In the town center, there's a four-way intersection with a single stoplight and a cluster of stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria once existed but has since closed. The local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, which is small and expensive; most residents shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. The town also has a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, which employs movers, and a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. There are small medical and veterinary practices, an elementary school, and plans to create a 2.5-acre recreational area. However, there are limited leisure activities, as there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, dog parks, or a diverse dining scene. Despite its simplicity, it's a pleasant town that's easy to pass through unnoticed.",
            "The first time I learned about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. The prices were astonishing—every apartment in the area was over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about it before. Perhaps it's due to the city's cost of living. I know several friends who struggle financially, but we've learned to be thrifty. We've grown accustomed to the smell of old, vintage items and clothes, which is less noticeable in adulthood. Some of us might turn to smoking or just get used to our circumstances. The flea market is a constant presence here, with its own distinct smell. The scent of worn-out magazines stacked on a closed piano lingers in the leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, along with a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's eerily quiet. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. The city is growing, with a large online empire for e-commerce and delivery. It's a similar atmosphere to New York—everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally leave you alone. You can live independently without much interference. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue to thrive around you. It's a lively place with neighbors who bring music into our lives. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. We've formed a close-knit community, helping each other out, celebrating milestones, and mourning losses. I'm fortunate to live here. Most of my neighbors are pleasant, and they treat me well. I make sure to keep my space clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. Despite living in a vast, impersonal modern city, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a quintessential suburban community, characterized by a homeowner's association that ensures uniform upkeep. Upon entering, visitors will find well-tended single-family homes, each with a small front lawn, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are immaculate, with no potholes or imperfections, and most houses are single-story, though some are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, with each household maintaining a key for their specific box, and larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of a city, blending rural and suburban elements, offering plenty of space and amenities. There are several community pools and walking trails for dog walking or leisurely strolls. Residents are primarily retired, but also include middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large in population but maintains a small-town feel, offering most amenities. A single mall caters to shopping needs, and major chains are accessible within 15 minutes' drive. Overall, the neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and provides a typical suburban lifestyle with the benefits of a larger city nearby.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is the town's most economically challenged area. Property values here are low, and the majority of residents are low-income individuals who either rent or own their homes. Despite this, the neighborhood is not unpleasant and is home to friendly neighbors who greet me with a smile as I pass by. Crime rates are higher than other parts of town but remain generally low. There have been a few incidents of violent crime in recent years, including shootings and homicides within a few blocks of my home. One of our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family, fortunately, has not been directly affected by crime beyond minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been considerably impacted by the opioid crisis, but there are numerous resources to combat it, including addiction treatment centers and Narcan training for families and friends. The town has several strengths, such as excellent schools for my son who has special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying, and he loves attending. The Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes various family events to promote education and engagement. With over 20% of the population below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Additionally, school fees and supplies are affordable. City improvements, while concentrated in the central and western areas, have positively impacted the town's appearance. However, the east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here due to the friendly community, great schools, adequate shopping options, and a comfortable home. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood bustles with culture and history. It's located on a hill, surrounded by buildings with significant historical value. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from a historic theater, and just a block away is a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, a line often forms outside, waiting to enter. A few blocks farther is the nearest city park, which is surprisingly large for the area. The park is bordered by concrete with tall stairs embedded in the wall. During winter, homeless people set up camp along the park's sidewalk and steps, preferring to stay in the city center for warmth. While snowfall is rare, the heavy rain in winter makes it challenging to stay warm. Their close proximity to the only family center in the area allows them easy access to facilities like showers and baths. What truly captivates me about my city is the resilience and spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories of federal intervention decades later. Despite its rough reputation, the community works hard to maintain a clean and safe environment. Passing through generations, these tales serve as constant reminders of the neighborhood's past. The people here are deeply aware of their surroundings, and while some warnings about safety at night persist, I feel a sense of acceptance and belonging. The Hilltop has made me feel alive, with people offering me kindness rather than hostility. It's a place where shop owners extend their hours to accommodate late-night patrons, and where I've experienced genuine human connection even on the grayest of nights.",
            "I reside in a rural area of America, particularly in a small town in Michigan. Here, farmland transitions into small tourist cities, and there are no major city malls, large chain stores like Walmart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's. Everything requires a drive to access. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most stunning places, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, providing numerous beaches for a dip. The neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not densely packed but are older, with many having basements that are visible from the street. Aluminum siding is common, with houses available in a wide array of colors. Most homes have yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. Residents are a close-knit community of hardworking people, raising families or having raised them. Children play and exercise freely on the streets, and neighbors interact warmly. Lawns are well-maintained, and properties are kept neat. The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful, and safe, reflecting the desire for a secure place to call home. Nearby, the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small town airport provide essential services. The local ice cream shop is within walking distance, and the downtown area is easily accessible by bike. The park is a short bike ride away, making it an excellent place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the sprawling metropolis where I reside, my neighborhood is an amalgam of diverse areas. Residential zones intermingle haphazardly with commercial districts, housing a myriad of businesses from corporate offices to independent stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Dining and shopping options are plentiful, ranging from big-name brands to trendy boutiques, which are scattered throughout the streets and malls. Several parks nearby are frequented by families with young children. My neighborhood boasts a vibrant mix of people, including a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and a contingent of former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants. Further afield, the city is home to distinct enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, each a few miles away but making for a lengthy commute due to traffic. With a vast cityscape, residents rarely walk, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking difficulties. Despite this, recent years have seen a surge in construction, with new apartment buildings popping up, much to the dismay of residents concerned about increased population and vehicle traffic. Housing options vary widely, from single-family homes to duplexes and small apartment buildings. Neighborhood dynamics reflect this diversity, with residents of all ages, including many I do not personally know. While I recall fond memories of childhood play with nearby friends, the neighborhood today is more diverse and less tightly-knit.",
            "My neighborhood is unique. While most of the houses are single-family homes, there are some that have been divided into two connected units. My home has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, along with many others, evokes a sense of a not-too-distant past where suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation, but its appeal is waning. However, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, clinging to it despite the changing times. The residents, though no longer as optimistic as before, maintain a sense of community. While the upkeep of the yards has declined, every driveway still has a car, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The public school, with a history spanning nearly a century, still stands as a symbol of the future for the youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. Though churches are sparse and often empty, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home has its own character, but collectively they convey a sense of unity. A large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, is the only Arab establishment in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing to let cars pass. Many residents have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew everyone. There was once a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate-themed films, it closed, and now a pharmacy stands in its place. A small theater screens old movies at a discounted price, attracting elders who view it as a reasonable night out without the children. A single expressway passes through our town, with its entrance and exit in the neighboring town. There was a proposal to move the exit to our town, but the youth supported it while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin the town's character. They convinced the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being built, and we're discussing a mascot for our town. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the perfect representation of our town.",
            "It might be easy to overlook this area from the outside - it's behind a shopping center and seems more like a residential backwater than a place where people live. Beyond the old, deserted Whole Foods store and the hotels that are mostly empty except for a few summer visits, you'll find a vibrant, hidden community. This community is home to a series of apartment complexes, stacked together like a row of carefully dismantled Russian nesting dolls. The nearby community college satellite campus is a tranquil, sleepy place where students start their days with coffee, while locals and commuters exchange grumbles. Turning off onto a residential road, you'll find a park and a rehabilitation center with cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan. Children play in the park, elderly residents walk their dogs, and teenagers gather at the playground, discussing the latest trends. A strip mall nearby offers affordable food options and a variety of shops, including a DIY frozen yogurt place. This neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana, unchanged even by time.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we drove past the expansive cornfields stretching out as far as the eye could see. “This is my place!” I exclaimed, knowing she'd be surprised by the vast openness. She came from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never experienced this much open space before. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of cornfields, I shared my childhood memories of rural Ohio with her, and in that moment, she finally understood my roots. As we drove along a winding two-lane road, we passed a quarry filled with water, just before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, with each one sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. During springtime, blooming flowers and the changing midwestern trees make the neighborhood come alive. The driveways are lined with luxurious Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approached my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was always outside, always ready with a friendly smile. He enjoyed spending his day mowing his lawn, often humming a tune over the mower's whirr. Everyone in the neighborhood found his constant presence amusing, but he was always genuine and had an intriguing past. He used to be a doctor and could often be mistaken for a part of the landscape with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we reached my home. Geese were abundant in the side yard, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, where you could hear bullfrogs croaking, the stream flowing, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was here that I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which usually meant chasing them. There was always something to do, and a friend nearby. The winters in my small town could be harsh, but they were also incredibly beautiful. The green yard transformed into a barren wilderness, and the vibrantly colored trees became bare skeletons of bark. Snowfall turned the backyard into a winter wonderland, with snow angels and snowmen left by my little sister. Snowballs were our favorite weapons, and we'd build massive igloo-like forts for our arsenal. During these cold winter days, we'd pretend in our own little wonderland, untouched by the cares of the world.",
            "Portland is renowned for its quirkiness, as encapsulated in the unofficial motto \"Keep Portland Weird,\" embossed on a building that serves multiple purposes, including pizza parlor, bar, music venue, and strip club, while often flirting with legal boundaries. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic call to the Portland of yesteryears, when it was less known and less costly, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it beckons them to come and find acceptance for their quirks, as Portland continues to embrace the unusual despite the influx of wealthy Californians and ongoing condominium construction. Portland’s weirdness isn’t about acceptance of everything, but it is open to the unconventional. It's a city where people take yoga with goats and cheer for the soccer team, and where you might find unexpected treasures in free boxes along the roadside. However, Portland also grapples with drug and homelessness issues, exacerbated by its rainy climate and social service limitations. Residents range from those who embrace this unconventional lifestyle to those who struggle to find a balance between care and intolerance. Despite these challenges, Portland remains a city where people passionately pursue their dreams, often with a healthy dose of whimsy.",
            "The mountains have been a constant presence, observing the sunrise and sunset each day. Despite my forgetfulness or preoccupation with life and work, they remain steadfast, unchanging, and undisturbed by life's challenges. On days when I'm most stressed, they remind me to look up and find solace, giving me strength to face the day. When I first moved here for my undergrad, the mountains north of campus were what initially captivated me. While the university offers its own impressive scenes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with charming cafes and a downtown area filled with historic buildings. This town, despite its small-town feel, has its own urban bustle, and the serene atmosphere can be found just beyond the library. The striking contrast of environments creates a unique charm that invites exploration and memory-making, from late-night walks in the park with friends to catching a movie downtown. However, it also holds unhappy memories, as all places do. The ponds, in particular, can be a place of introspection and late-night tears. As I watched the creatures living their lives, I wondered about my own purpose and walked along the main street, where the sunrise illuminated the palm trees, leading me north. The mountains, ever-present and tall, stood out against the horizon, inspiring a sense of determination within me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll find it easy to get to, thanks to the city's excellent public transportation system, which is very popular among residents. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in New York City. During your visit, you'll come across numerous Asian stores; in fact, the neighborhood has seen a significant increase in Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are prevalent and highly regarded for their quality and affordability. Near my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping convenient. While Bensonhurst is diverse with immigrants and their American-born children, many businesses are Asian-owned. The neighborhood also features a recently renovated park with basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. Despite the noise from cars and the occasional package theft, Bensonhurst is generally safe. However, be cautious, especially at night. There's also an issue with dog waste on the streets. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and the terrain slopes downwards, with my house situated at the peak of the steepest hill. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to the popularity of joggers training on it. The road is rough and hazardous, with potholes and disrepair, while overhead telephone and electrical wires are often damaged and patched up following frequent storms. Dense evergreen trees surround the area, though locals dislike them because they block the ocean view, leading to houses built high up the hill. At sunset, the bay lights up with a beautiful orange glow, but it's often cloudy and damp, with moss growing on various surfaces. Few children reside here; instead, old folks and retired people populate the community, often accompanied by dogs. Larger-than-average rabbits roam freely, causing issues for gardeners, but cats hunt them. Birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles (chased off by crows), are common. Stores are scarce, but a few restaurants offering fresh seafood are found near the waterfront. The bay is narrow, and you can easily see the opposite shore.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town of Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, resulting in more traffic than desired, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's minimal turnover among residents, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with our neighbors. Most individuals spend their time on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, and our house's front corner location affords us a view of everyone coming and going. We're accustomed to seeing familiar cars and take note of any new ones. Neighbors engage in activities like walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on bikes. As a family of four—myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen—we're often at home due to our remote work setup. We enjoy outdoor play, even in the rain, and occasionally grill outside, filling the neighborhood with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowing is a common sound from March through October. Our neighborhood has many trees, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf raking and burning in fall. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. The recent mild winters have extended the fall season. Our garage is at the back, so we mainly use the front door for visitors, which are rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage doors are open. During holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for visitors from out of town. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, where dirt is prevalent. Except for those who have actually lived here, the feeling of seeing brown landscapes most of the time is hard to comprehend. When a green lawn is spotted, it indicates considerable efforts and expense on lawn care. In the 1990s, residential houses were scattered far apart, but now, while the layout remains similar, there are many new additions. The area is transforming into a city, though this may be a common trend. Generally, residents are friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my area, I am surrounded by friendly elderly people, making it a pleasant neighborhood. Stores are mostly chain retailers, with few local independent options. The prominent industry in this city is construction, due to the vast undeveloped spaces. While I appreciate the natural beauty, I worry about the ongoing development. Having moved from a large city, I'm not eager to return. My full-time job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. I enjoy the diverse wildlife here. People visit the high desert for its stark beauty and unique ecosystems, which house various animals. It's essential for residents to learn about these non-human inhabitants for safe coexistence. My children are fascinated by the local wildlife, especially lizards and desert insects. Attractions include the nearby Wrightwood's snow-covered mountains and the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which offers diverse activities. For those interested in natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological, paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, my response is somewhat unique. Unlike others who live in the area, I reside on a college campus and consider it my primary neighborhood. The people living in my dormitory make up my community, and while the broader campus is also part of my neighborhood, it plays a secondary role. Despite this unconventional perspective, my neighborhood shares common features with more traditional ones, including homes, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"homes\" in my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it's important to note the types of housing present. There are three main types: apartments, traditional houses, and dormitories. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common apartment buildings can house around 20 people. Traditional houses are available to rent by those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents, but these are fewer in number and less efficient. Dormitories are the most common type of housing, with each room housing two people, and hundreds of students living on campus. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the cultural and age diversity of my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the traditional houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in this neighborhood would be insufficient, so let's move on to the stores and parks. As the campus is self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options found elsewhere, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, making it convenient for all needs. The park is a communal space for the diverse residents, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "I've been living here for nearly a decade, so I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite disheartened when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was homesick and missed my old neighborhood deeply, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we relocated to a more affluent area. Over time, I adapted and made new friends, some of whom remain my acquaintances now. I barely interacted with my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived next door. They were always friendly, and I consider them like family. I recall my parents, sister, and I attended Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a memorable and enjoyable event. I caught his wife's bouquet, even if only part of it! We danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is a bit confusing, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only ventured so far, where I hang out with Kason and Curtis. We used to spend a lot of time playing video games and enjoying life. I also like going to the park to connect with nature, which helps me relax. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken sword if I have it. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played there in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard but always had fun. I've had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and I believe the best times are yet to come!",
            "I live close to the college I attend, which I appreciate. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are both enjoyable and affordable. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit pricier, yet it still offers decent service and drinks. The residents are mostly college students or lower-income individuals due to the affordable housing. There's an elementary school nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors personally, they generally seem pleasant. They tend to smoke marijuana, and the building management has placed an air freshener unit near their doors, which I found amusing. The surrounding buildings are usually older but may have modern interiors. Just down the road, there are newer apartment complexes that, while built cheaply, command high rents due to their proximity to campus. A nearby eatery serves food on paper plates, using a microwave, and across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. The road was recently improved by the city, with sidewalks and landscaping added, enhancing the area. The building I live in is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps left behind after some were cut down. There are more trees on my street than down the road, and the sidewalks on 43rd Street are in poor condition, with many shabby buildings. Crime has occurred in the nearby apartment complexes, but I find my current residence affordable and convenient, with useful amenities nearby and the university within walking distance. The bus stops and walkability to the store and downtown make it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is composed of a series of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, giving the appearance of individual homes. The only distinguishing feature is their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. We're like a tightly-knit community; most everyone is friends with one another. In the evenings, we socialize at the end of a shared driveway while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from our tech-filled world, reminiscent of stepping back in time. Our neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds, but there's a downside - we've been experiencing tornado warnings. Recently, we heard sirens and took shelter. I huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming, and we went from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. Hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped pictures to share, amazed by the sight. The streets remained quiet for an hour before people returned from wherever they'd been during the storm. Life returned to normal with moms and children outside while dinner was cooked. I love this friendly neighborhood, where I've recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most others, but the interiors vary in size. I enjoy walking along the biggest field behind my home to the pond, where I've seen deer and heard giant bullfrogs in the morning. It's like living in a small community village, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets us know he's there with his bray. I consider myself fortunate to have found this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood as I was about to begin eighth grade. While it was challenging to befriend others initially, I eventually connected with a couple of kids nearby: one who lived two houses down and another who lived on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories of our friendship remain. Many of the original inhabitants still live in the neighborhood, which is quite typical of a standard American suburban area. The neighborhood is characterized by two-story houses and is generally quiet, with the exception of weekends or warm days when children play outside. I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors, and I feel secure knowing that I can rely on them if needed. I've never experienced any porch package thefts, which gives me confidence in my neighbors' trustworthiness. A park situated a short distance from my house holds many fond memories for me. I've played various sports there with neighborhood friends, though one of my worst experiences involved getting injured while playing football. Despite this, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger children. They always enjoy going there, and the park evokes nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering numerous food options within a mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The neighborhood also offers various stores that cater to everyday needs, with a range of ethnic-owned establishments. I'm content with my neighborhood, as I see and read about the struggles other people face with their neighbors on social media and the news.",
            "Our village is charming and ordinary, much like the rest of South Carolina, but it's a significant player in the agriculture industry. Johnston is proudly known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a claim it displays on its welcoming sign. The town is predominantly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle farms. Houses outside of the main town area are scattered and mainly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs. They are often situated farther back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or grazing. In the town center, there's a four-way intersection with a single stoplight and a cluster of stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria once existed but has since closed. The local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, which is small and expensive; most residents shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. The town also has a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, which employs movers, and a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. There are small medical and veterinary practices, an elementary school, and plans to create a 2.5-acre recreational area. However, there are limited leisure activities, as there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, dog parks, or a diverse dining scene. Despite its simplicity, it's a pleasant town that's easy to pass through unnoticed.",
            "The first time I learned about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. The prices were astonishing—every apartment in the area was over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about it before. Perhaps it's due to the city's cost of living. I know several friends who struggle financially, but we've learned to be thrifty. We've grown accustomed to the smell of old, vintage items and clothes, which is less noticeable in adulthood. Some of us might turn to smoking or just get used to our circumstances. The flea market is a constant presence here, with its own distinct smell. The scent of worn-out magazines stacked on a closed piano lingers in the leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, along with a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's eerily quiet. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. The city is growing, with a large online empire for e-commerce and delivery. It's a similar atmosphere to New York—everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally leave you alone. You can live independently without much interference. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue to thrive around you. It's a lively place with neighbors who bring music into our lives. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. We've formed a close-knit community, helping each other out, celebrating milestones, and mourning losses. I'm fortunate to live here. Most of my neighbors are pleasant, and they treat me well. I make sure to keep my space clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. Despite living in a vast, impersonal modern city, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a quintessential suburban community, characterized by a homeowner's association that ensures uniform upkeep. Upon entering, visitors will find well-tended single-family homes, each with a small front lawn, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are immaculate, with no potholes or imperfections, and most houses are single-story, though some are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, with each household maintaining a key for their specific box, and larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of a city, blending rural and suburban elements, offering plenty of space and amenities. There are several community pools and walking trails for dog walking or leisurely strolls. Residents are primarily retired, but also include middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large in population but maintains a small-town feel, offering most amenities. A single mall caters to shopping needs, and major chains are accessible within 15 minutes' drive. Overall, the neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and provides a typical suburban lifestyle with the benefits of a larger city nearby.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is the town's most economically challenged area. Property values here are low, and the majority of residents are low-income individuals who either rent or own their homes. Despite this, the neighborhood is not unpleasant and is home to friendly neighbors who greet me with a smile as I pass by. Crime rates are higher than other parts of town but remain generally low. There have been a few incidents of violent crime in recent years, including shootings and homicides within a few blocks of my home. One of our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family, fortunately, has not been directly affected by crime beyond minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been considerably impacted by the opioid crisis, but there are numerous resources to combat it, including addiction treatment centers and Narcan training for families and friends. The town has several strengths, such as excellent schools for my son who has special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying, and he loves attending. The Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes various family events to promote education and engagement. With over 20% of the population below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Additionally, school fees and supplies are affordable. City improvements, while concentrated in the central and western areas, have positively impacted the town's appearance. However, the east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here due to the friendly community, great schools, adequate shopping options, and a comfortable home. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood bustles with culture and history. It's located on a hill, surrounded by buildings with significant historical value. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from a historic theater, and just a block away is a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, a line often forms outside, waiting to enter. A few blocks farther is the nearest city park, which is surprisingly large for the area. The park is bordered by concrete with tall stairs embedded in the wall. During winter, homeless people set up camp along the park's sidewalk and steps, preferring to stay in the city center for warmth. While snowfall is rare, the heavy rain in winter makes it challenging to stay warm. Their close proximity to the only family center in the area allows them easy access to facilities like showers and baths. What truly captivates me about my city is the resilience and spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories of federal intervention decades later. Despite its rough reputation, the community works hard to maintain a clean and safe environment. Passing through generations, these tales serve as constant reminders of the neighborhood's past. The people here are deeply aware of their surroundings, and while some warnings about safety at night persist, I feel a sense of acceptance and belonging. The Hilltop has made me feel alive, with people offering me kindness rather than hostility. It's a place where shop owners extend their hours to accommodate late-night patrons, and where I've experienced genuine human connection even on the grayest of nights.",
            "I reside in a rural area of America, particularly in a small town in Michigan. Here, farmland transitions into small tourist cities, and there are no major city malls, large chain stores like Walmart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's. Everything requires a drive to access. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most stunning places, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, providing numerous beaches for a dip. The neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not densely packed but are older, with many having basements that are visible from the street. Aluminum siding is common, with houses available in a wide array of colors. Most homes have yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. Residents are a close-knit community of hardworking people, raising families or having raised them. Children play and exercise freely on the streets, and neighbors interact warmly. Lawns are well-maintained, and properties are kept neat. The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful, and safe, reflecting the desire for a secure place to call home. Nearby, the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small town airport provide essential services. The local ice cream shop is within walking distance, and the downtown area is easily accessible by bike. The park is a short bike ride away, making it an excellent place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the sprawling metropolis where I reside, my neighborhood is an amalgam of diverse areas. Residential zones intermingle haphazardly with commercial districts, housing a myriad of businesses from corporate offices to independent stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Dining and shopping options are plentiful, ranging from big-name brands to trendy boutiques, which are scattered throughout the streets and malls. Several parks nearby are frequented by families with young children. My neighborhood boasts a vibrant mix of people, including a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and a contingent of former Soviet Union refugees and immigrants. Further afield, the city is home to distinct enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, each a few miles away but making for a lengthy commute due to traffic. With a vast cityscape, residents rarely walk, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking difficulties. Despite this, recent years have seen a surge in construction, with new apartment buildings popping up, much to the dismay of residents concerned about increased population and vehicle traffic. Housing options vary widely, from single-family homes to duplexes and small apartment buildings. Neighborhood dynamics reflect this diversity, with residents of all ages, including many I do not personally know. While I recall fond memories of childhood play with nearby friends, the neighborhood today is more diverse and less tightly-knit.",
            "My neighborhood is unique. While most of the houses are single-family homes, there are some that have been divided into two connected units. My home has a small front yard and a narrow driveway to the left. It, along with many others, evokes a sense of a not-too-distant past where suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation, but its appeal is waning. However, my neighborhood and many others still stand as a testament to that dream, clinging to it despite the changing times. The residents, though no longer as optimistic as before, maintain a sense of community. While the upkeep of the yards has declined, every driveway still has a car, and children continue to play as if the world revolves around them. The public school, with a history spanning nearly a century, still stands as a symbol of the future for the youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. Though churches are sparse and often empty, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home has its own character, but collectively they convey a sense of unity. A large supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, is the only Arab establishment in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing to let cars pass. Many residents have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew everyone. There was once a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate-themed films, it closed, and now a pharmacy stands in its place. A small theater screens old movies at a discounted price, attracting elders who view it as a reasonable night out without the children. A single expressway passes through our town, with its entrance and exit in the neighboring town. There was a proposal to move the exit to our town, but the youth supported it while the elders opposed it, fearing it would ruin the town's character. They convinced the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being built, and we're discussing a mascot for our town. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin as the perfect representation of our town.",
            "It might be easy to overlook this area from the outside - it's behind a shopping center and seems more like a residential backwater than a place where people live. Beyond the old, deserted Whole Foods store and the hotels that are mostly empty except for a few summer visits, you'll find a vibrant, hidden community. This community is home to a series of apartment complexes, stacked together like a row of carefully dismantled Russian nesting dolls. The nearby community college satellite campus is a tranquil, sleepy place where students start their days with coffee, while locals and commuters exchange grumbles. Turning off onto a residential road, you'll find a park and a rehabilitation center with cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan. Children play in the park, elderly residents walk their dogs, and teenagers gather at the playground, discussing the latest trends. A strip mall nearby offers affordable food options and a variety of shops, including a DIY frozen yogurt place. This neighborhood is a slice of classic Americana, unchanged even by time.",
            "“Where are we going?” she asked as we drove past the expansive cornfields stretching out as far as the eye could see. “This is my place!” I exclaimed, knowing she'd be surprised by the vast openness. She came from a town where the nearest grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never experienced this much open space before. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of cornfields, I shared my childhood memories of rural Ohio with her, and in that moment, she finally understood my roots. As we drove along a winding two-lane road, we passed a quarry filled with water, just before reaching my small development. The houses here are mostly brick and stucco, with each one sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes great care to maintain. During springtime, blooming flowers and the changing midwestern trees make the neighborhood come alive. The driveways are lined with luxurious Mercedes-Benzes that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approached my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was always outside, always ready with a friendly smile. He enjoyed spending his day mowing his lawn, often humming a tune over the mower's whirr. Everyone in the neighborhood found his constant presence amusing, but he was always genuine and had an intriguing past. He used to be a doctor and could often be mistaken for a part of the landscape with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we reached my home. Geese were abundant in the side yard, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream fed into the quarry, where you could hear bullfrogs croaking, the stream flowing, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. It was here that I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which usually meant chasing them. There was always something to do, and a friend nearby. The winters in my small town could be harsh, but they were also incredibly beautiful. The green yard transformed into a barren wilderness, and the vibrantly colored trees became bare skeletons of bark. Snowfall turned the backyard into a winter wonderland, with snow angels and snowmen left by my little sister. Snowballs were our favorite weapons, and we'd build massive igloo-like forts for our arsenal. During these cold winter days, we'd pretend in our own little wonderland, untouched by the cares of the world.",
            "Portland is renowned for its quirkiness, as encapsulated in the unofficial motto \"Keep Portland Weird,\" embossed on a building that serves multiple purposes, including pizza parlor, bar, music venue, and strip club, while often flirting with legal boundaries. To some, this phrase is a nostalgic call to the Portland of yesteryears, when it was less known and less costly, fostering creative and unique subcultures. To others, it beckons them to come and find acceptance for their quirks, as Portland continues to embrace the unusual despite the influx of wealthy Californians and ongoing condominium construction. Portland’s weirdness isn’t about acceptance of everything, but it is open to the unconventional. It's a city where people take yoga with goats and cheer for the soccer team, and where you might find unexpected treasures in free boxes along the roadside. However, Portland also grapples with drug and homelessness issues, exacerbated by its rainy climate and social service limitations. Residents range from those who embrace this unconventional lifestyle to those who struggle to find a balance between care and intolerance. Despite these challenges, Portland remains a city where people passionately pursue their dreams, often with a healthy dose of whimsy.",
            "The mountains have been a constant presence, observing the sunrise and sunset each day. Despite my forgetfulness or preoccupation with life and work, they remain steadfast, unchanging, and undisturbed by life's challenges. On days when I'm most stressed, they remind me to look up and find solace, giving me strength to face the day. When I first moved here for my undergrad, the mountains north of campus were what initially captivated me. While the university offers its own impressive scenes, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is beautiful, with charming cafes and a downtown area filled with historic buildings. This town, despite its small-town feel, has its own urban bustle, and the serene atmosphere can be found just beyond the library. The striking contrast of environments creates a unique charm that invites exploration and memory-making, from late-night walks in the park with friends to catching a movie downtown. However, it also holds unhappy memories, as all places do. The ponds, in particular, can be a place of introspection and late-night tears. As I watched the creatures living their lives, I wondered about my own purpose and walked along the main street, where the sunrise illuminated the palm trees, leading me north. The mountains, ever-present and tall, stood out against the horizon, inspiring a sense of determination within me.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll find it easy to get to, thanks to the city's excellent public transportation system, which is very popular among residents. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in New York City. During your visit, you'll come across numerous Asian stores; in fact, the neighborhood has seen a significant increase in Asian inhabitants over the past two decades. Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are prevalent and highly regarded for their quality and affordability. Near my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, making grocery shopping convenient. While Bensonhurst is diverse with immigrants and their American-born children, many businesses are Asian-owned. The neighborhood also features a recently renovated park with basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. Despite the noise from cars and the occasional package theft, Bensonhurst is generally safe. However, be cautious, especially at night. There's also an issue with dog waste on the streets. Keep your shoes clean!",
            "My neighborhood lacks sidewalks, and the terrain slopes downwards, with my house situated at the peak of the steepest hill. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" due to the popularity of joggers training on it. The road is rough and hazardous, with potholes and disrepair, while overhead telephone and electrical wires are often damaged and patched up following frequent storms. Dense evergreen trees surround the area, though locals dislike them because they block the ocean view, leading to houses built high up the hill. At sunset, the bay lights up with a beautiful orange glow, but it's often cloudy and damp, with moss growing on various surfaces. Few children reside here; instead, old folks and retired people populate the community, often accompanied by dogs. Larger-than-average rabbits roam freely, causing issues for gardeners, but cats hunt them. Birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles (chased off by crows), are common. Stores are scarce, but a few restaurants offering fresh seafood are found near the waterfront. The bay is narrow, and you can easily see the opposite shore.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town of Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, resulting in more traffic than desired, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's minimal turnover among residents, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with our neighbors. Most individuals spend their time on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street, and our house's front corner location affords us a view of everyone coming and going. We're accustomed to seeing familiar cars and take note of any new ones. Neighbors engage in activities like walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on bikes. As a family of four—myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen—we're often at home due to our remote work setup. We enjoy outdoor play, even in the rain, and occasionally grill outside, filling the neighborhood with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowing is a common sound from March through October. Our neighborhood has many trees, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf raking and burning in fall. I appreciate the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. The recent mild winters have extended the fall season. Our garage is at the back, so we mainly use the front door for visitors, which are rare. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, feeling more connected to the neighborhood when the garage doors are open. During holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the neighborhood is quiet, except for visitors from out of town. Overall, I'm content with living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, where dirt is prevalent. Except for those who have actually lived here, the feeling of seeing brown landscapes most of the time is hard to comprehend. When a green lawn is spotted, it indicates considerable efforts and expense on lawn care. In the 1990s, residential houses were scattered far apart, but now, while the layout remains similar, there are many new additions. The area is transforming into a city, though this may be a common trend. Generally, residents are friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my area, I am surrounded by friendly elderly people, making it a pleasant neighborhood. Stores are mostly chain retailers, with few local independent options. The prominent industry in this city is construction, due to the vast undeveloped spaces. While I appreciate the natural beauty, I worry about the ongoing development. Having moved from a large city, I'm not eager to return. My full-time job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. I enjoy the diverse wildlife here. People visit the high desert for its stark beauty and unique ecosystems, which house various animals. It's essential for residents to learn about these non-human inhabitants for safe coexistence. My children are fascinated by the local wildlife, especially lizards and desert insects. Attractions include the nearby Wrightwood's snow-covered mountains and the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which offers diverse activities. For those interested in natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological, paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, my response is somewhat unique. Unlike others who live in the area, I reside on a college campus and consider it my primary neighborhood. The people living in my dormitory make up my community, and while the broader campus is also part of my neighborhood, it plays a secondary role. Despite this unconventional perspective, my neighborhood shares common features with more traditional ones, including homes, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"homes\" in my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it's important to note the types of housing present. There are three main types: apartments, traditional houses, and dormitories. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common apartment buildings can house around 20 people. Traditional houses are available to rent by those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents, but these are fewer in number and less efficient. Dormitories are the most common type of housing, with each room housing two people, and hundreds of students living on campus. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the cultural and age diversity of my neighborhood. Professional staff often live in the traditional houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Discussing the people in this neighborhood would be insufficient, so let's move on to the stores and parks. As the campus is self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options found elsewhere, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores, making it convenient for all needs. The park is a communal space for the diverse residents, kept clean and safe by the community.",
            "I've been living here for nearly a decade, so I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite disheartened when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was homesick and missed my old neighborhood deeply, but my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we relocated to a more affluent area. Over time, I adapted and made new friends, some of whom remain my acquaintances now. I barely interacted with my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived next door. They were always friendly, and I consider them like family. I recall my parents, sister, and I attended Mr. Glen's wedding, which was a memorable and enjoyable event. I caught his wife's bouquet, even if only part of it! We danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is a bit confusing, but with my GPS, I can explore more. I've only ventured so far, where I hang out with Kason and Curtis. We used to spend a lot of time playing video games and enjoying life. I also like going to the park to connect with nature, which helps me relax. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken sword if I have it. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played there in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves. We worked hard but always had fun. I've had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and I believe the best times are yet to come!",
            "I live close to the college I attend, which I appreciate. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are both enjoyable and affordable. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit pricier, yet it still offers decent service and drinks. The residents are mostly college students or lower-income individuals due to the affordable housing. There's an elementary school nearby, and while I don't know my neighbors personally, they generally seem pleasant. They tend to smoke marijuana, and the building management has placed an air freshener unit near their doors, which I found amusing. The surrounding buildings are usually older but may have modern interiors. Just down the road, there are newer apartment complexes that, while built cheaply, command high rents due to their proximity to campus. A nearby eatery serves food on paper plates, using a microwave, and across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. The road was recently improved by the city, with sidewalks and landscaping added, enhancing the area. The building I live in is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps left behind after some were cut down. There are more trees on my street than down the road, and the sidewalks on 43rd Street are in poor condition, with many shabby buildings. Crime has occurred in the nearby apartment complexes, but I find my current residence affordable and convenient, with useful amenities nearby and the university within walking distance. The bus stops and walkability to the store and downtown make it easy to get around.",
            "My neighborhood is composed of a series of duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, giving the appearance of individual homes. The only distinguishing feature is their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. We're like a tightly-knit community; most everyone is friends with one another. In the evenings, we socialize at the end of a shared driveway while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing change from our tech-filled world, reminiscent of stepping back in time. Our neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds, but there's a downside - we've been experiencing tornado warnings. Recently, we heard sirens and took shelter. I huddled in my bathtub with my smallest dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. After the storm, the road was steaming, and we went from 92°F to 75°F in minutes. Hail melted instantly on the hot pavement, and a double rainbow appeared. I snapped pictures to share, amazed by the sight. The streets remained quiet for an hour before people returned from wherever they'd been during the storm. Life returned to normal with moms and children outside while dinner was cooked. I love this friendly neighborhood, where I've recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most others, but the interiors vary in size. I enjoy walking along the biggest field behind my home to the pond, where I've seen deer and heard giant bullfrogs in the morning. It's like living in a small community village, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters from nearby farms, and in the evening, a donkey from a nearby farm lets us know he's there with his bray. I consider myself fortunate to have found this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood as I was about to begin eighth grade. While it was challenging to befriend others initially, I eventually connected with a couple of kids nearby: one who lived two houses down and another who lived on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories of our friendship remain. Many of the original inhabitants still live in the neighborhood, which is quite typical of a standard American suburban area. The neighborhood is characterized by two-story houses and is generally quiet, with the exception of weekends or warm days when children play outside. I've never encountered any issues with my neighbors, and I feel secure knowing that I can rely on them if needed. I've never experienced any porch package thefts, which gives me confidence in my neighbors' trustworthiness. A park situated a short distance from my house holds many fond memories for me. I've played various sports there with neighborhood friends, though one of my worst experiences involved getting injured while playing football. Despite this, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's younger children. They always enjoy going there, and the park evokes nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering numerous food options within a mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now opt for food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. The neighborhood also offers various stores that cater to everyday needs, with a range of ethnic-owned establishments. I'm content with my neighborhood, as I see and read about the struggles other people face with their neighbors on social media and the news.",
            "Our village is charming and ordinary, much like the rest of South Carolina, but it's a significant player in the agriculture industry. Johnston is proudly known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a claim it displays on its welcoming sign. The town is predominantly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle farms. Houses outside of the main town area are scattered and mainly two-story, with metal or gray shingle roofs. They are often situated farther back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for farming or grazing. In the town center, there's a four-way intersection with a single stoplight and a cluster of stores. Fast food options include Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A pizzeria once existed but has since closed. The local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store is IGA, which is small and expensive; most residents shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General is the most popular store, selling a wide range of everyday items. The town also has a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, which employs movers, and a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. There are small medical and veterinary practices, an elementary school, and plans to create a 2.5-acre recreational area. However, there are limited leisure activities, as there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, dog parks, or a diverse dining scene. Despite its simplicity, it's a pleasant town that's easy to pass through unnoticed.",
            "The first time I learned about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. The prices were astonishing—every apartment in the area was over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about it before. Perhaps it's due to the city's cost of living. I know several friends who struggle financially, but we've learned to be thrifty. We've grown accustomed to the smell of old, vintage items and clothes, which is less noticeable in adulthood. Some of us might turn to smoking or just get used to our circumstances. The flea market is a constant presence here, with its own distinct smell. The scent of worn-out magazines stacked on a closed piano lingers in the leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance, along with a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's eerily quiet. It's a peaceful place to spend an afternoon. The city is growing, with a large online empire for e-commerce and delivery. It's a similar atmosphere to New York—everyone is focused on their own goals, and people generally leave you alone. You can live independently without much interference. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, people mind their own business. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue to thrive around you. It's a lively place with neighbors who bring music into our lives. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always some activity. We've formed a close-knit community, helping each other out, celebrating milestones, and mourning losses. I'm fortunate to live here. Most of my neighbors are pleasant, and they treat me well. I make sure to keep my space clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. Despite living in a vast, impersonal modern city, it's my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't ruined my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a quintessential suburban community, characterized by a homeowner's association that ensures uniform upkeep. Upon entering, visitors will find well-tended single-family homes, each with a small front lawn, decorative pebbles, and a two-car garage. The streets are immaculate, with no potholes or imperfections, and most houses are single-story, though some are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, with each household maintaining a key for their specific box, and larger lockers for packages. The neighborhood is on the outskirts of a city, blending rural and suburban elements, offering plenty of space and amenities. There are several community pools and walking trails for dog walking or leisurely strolls. Residents are primarily retired, but also include middle-aged and young professionals. The city is large in population but maintains a small-town feel, offering most amenities. A single mall caters to shopping needs, and major chains are accessible within 15 minutes' drive. Overall, the neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and provides a typical suburban lifestyle with the benefits of a larger city nearby.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is the town's most economically challenged area. Property values here are low, and the majority of residents are low-income individuals who either rent or own their homes. Despite this, the neighborhood is not unpleasant and is home to friendly neighbors who greet me with a smile as I pass by. Crime rates are higher than other parts of town but remain generally low. There have been a few incidents of violent crime in recent years, including shootings and homicides within a few blocks of my home. One of our neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Our family, fortunately, has not been directly affected by crime beyond minor incidents like missing items from our porch. The town has been considerably impacted by the opioid crisis, but there are numerous resources to combat it, including addiction treatment centers and Narcan training for families and friends. The town has several strengths, such as excellent schools for my son who has special needs. The school's positive atmosphere has prevented any bullying, and he loves attending. The Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes various family events to promote education and engagement. With over 20% of the population below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. Additionally, school fees and supplies are affordable. City improvements, while concentrated in the central and western areas, have positively impacted the town's appearance. However, the east side, where I live, often feels neglected. Nevertheless, I enjoy living here due to the friendly community, great schools, adequate shopping options, and a comfortable home. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood bustles with culture and history. It's located on a hill, surrounded by buildings with significant historical value. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from a historic theater, and just a block away is a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, a line often forms outside, waiting to enter. A few blocks farther is the nearest city park, which is surprisingly large for the area. The park is bordered by concrete with tall stairs embedded in the wall. During winter, homeless people set up camp along the park's sidewalk and steps, preferring to stay in the city center for warmth. While snowfall is rare, the heavy rain in winter makes it challenging to stay warm. Their close proximity to the only family center in the area allows them easy access to facilities like showers and baths. What truly captivates me about my city is the resilience and spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, still echoes with stories of federal intervention decades later. Despite its rough reputation, the community works hard to maintain a clean and safe environment. Passing through generations, these tales serve as constant reminders of the neighborhood's past. The people here are deeply aware of their surroundings, and while some warnings about safety at night persist, I feel a sense of acceptance and belonging. The Hilltop has made me feel alive, with people offering me kindness rather than hostility. It's a place where shop owners extend their hours to accommodate late-night patrons, and where I've experienced genuine human connection even on the grayest of nights.",
            "I reside in a rural area of America, particularly in a small town in Michigan. Here, farmland transitions into small tourist cities, and there are no major city malls, large chain stores like Walmart or Target, or restaurants like Applebee's. Everything requires a drive to access. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most stunning places, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, providing numerous beaches for a dip. The neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town living. Houses are not densely packed but are older, with many having basements that are visible from the street. Aluminum siding is common, with houses available in a wide array of colors. Most homes have yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for animals. Residents are a close-knit community of hardworking people, raising families or having raised them. Children play and exercise freely on the streets, and neighbors interact warmly. Lawns are well-maintained, and properties are kept neat. The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful, and safe, reflecting the desire for a secure place to call home. Nearby, the county sheriff's department and jail, health department, city recycling center, baseball and softball fields, and a small town airport provide essential services. The local ice cream shop is within walking distance, and the downtown area is easily accessible by bike. The park is a short bike ride away, making it an excellent place to raise a family."
