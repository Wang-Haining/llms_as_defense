            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Expanding slightly beyond my immediate area reveals more diverse communities, including Little Korea, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving; a mere 10 miles may take two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours.

My home has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, reflecting the American dream of suburban living that once captivated our country. Though that dream seems to be waning, remnants of it remain, like my neighborhood and others, hinting at its enduring allure. While optimism and yard maintenance have declined, cars still populate driveways, and kids still play as if the world is their playground. The century-old public school still stands, inspiring both today's youth and stirring nostalgic memories in older residents. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Though each home is distinctive, they share a similar feel.

A single expressway runs through our town, with exits and entrances in the neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was rejected due to fears of ruining the neighborhood, a decision supported by the youth and opposed by the elders.

            "The mountains are ever-present, standing vigilant as the sun rises and sets each day. Regardless of how busy or distracted I become, they remain unyielding, undeterred by life's challenges. In times of stress, they call out to me, and when I look to them, they offer solace and strength, helping me carry on day by day. I moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my first captivating sight. While the university itself is a beautiful place with its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is lovely as well, with charming cafes where I spent many hours studying, and a bustling downtown area that contrasts with its quiet, small-town streets. This mix of environments creates a unique atmosphere, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories. From late-night walks in the park to movie nights in town, the town holds both joyful and painful memories. The ponds are especially conducive to reflection and quiet moments. I often found myself contemplating life's purpose while watching the creatures there. One day, as I walked past the pond and through the park, I reached a main street. The sun rose, casting its golden rays on the palm trees, and I realized I was heading north. There, I saw the mountains, their solid presence filling the sky, reigniting my resolve.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding it shouldn't be a problem—public transportation is readily available and popular throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel you're in the heart of the city. During your stay, you'll encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents, resulting in Asian-owned businesses on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common and popular among locals, offering excellent quality food at affordable prices and convenient locations. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other near where I live. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, it's diverse with immigrants and their children living here. Many large local businesses are Asian-owned. There's also a nearby park that's been recently renovated, featuring ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. The park is diverse, with people from various backgrounds getting along well. Corporate buildings aren't prevalent; instead, you'll find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and many are friendly but noisy, with frequent car noise and occasional dog waste on the streets. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's important to be cautious, as there have been incidents of bullying and package theft. I've personally experienced physical assault in the past, but these incidents are less common nowadays. Additionally, there's a lack of adherence to the city's regulations regarding dog waste, leading to a significant amount of it on the streets. Keep your shoes clean, as dog waste is a common issue in the neighborhood.",
            "In my residential area, there's a scarcity of sidewalks. The terrain slopes downward, placing my house at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, dubbed the \"work out hill\" by locals for its popularity among joggers. Lacking sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk along the road, which is rough and dangerous to drive on. Power lines and telephone wires are in disrepair, often damaged by storms and debris. Towering evergreens surround the area, but they're unpopular due to blocking ocean views, leading to many residents building houses high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are spectacular, with the water's reflection creating a glow, though it's often cloudy and damp, resulting in a moist environment where moss thrives. Children are few, and the neighborhood is primarily inhabited by elderly residents and their dogs, which are often seen in yards or on the streets. Gardens and lawns are frequently undermined by rabbits, while various birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be spotted. There are no stores nearby, but a few waterfront restaurants serve local seafood. The bay is narrow, allowing visibility of the opposite shore most days, and the rocky shoreline is good for tossing stones into the water.",
            "Our home is situated in a typical residential area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Being located at the junction of two state highways, we experience a bit more traffic than we'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains mostly quiet. With a relatively stable population, I'm familiar with most of my neighbors, who generally keep to themselves and focus on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house at the end of the street allows us to see most of the neighborhood's comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars driven by our neighbors. Unusual vehicles catch our attention. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on their bikes. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. We work from home and are often outside playing, even in the rain. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the aroma of barbecue fills the air. The lawn mowing season runs from March to October, with leaves being raked and burned in the fall, which I also like as a sign of the season. The neighborhood is wooded, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf cleanup. Recent winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless expecting guests, which is uncommon. I enjoy tinkering in the garage, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, but some families visit from out of town, with extra vehicles parked on the street. All in all, I'm fond of living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the desert, where dust is abundant, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating substantial care and expense. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but the area has seen considerable development with new additions, making it increasingly urban-like. The community is generally welcoming, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is populated by friendly seniors, and the shops are mostly chain establishments, with few independent stores. The primary employment sector here is construction, given the city's undeveloped areas. I've grown fond of the unique wildlife, which includes lizards and desert insects, although I prefer this location over my previous big-city home. Victorville offers attractions like the San Bernardino County Fair and nearby snow-capped mountains, while the Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's natural history and culture.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I might describe it in a way that's a bit different. While typical answers might come from homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation is unique. My neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I live, with my dormitory residents being my community, and the surrounding campus as my extended neighborhood. While this is unconventional, my neighborhood shares some common elements with traditional neighborhoods, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the types of \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to note the three types of housing I reside in: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, rooms typically house 2-4 people with 4-6 rooms per floor, and a building can accommodate around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents. These houses are fewer in number due to their lower efficiency. Finally, dormitories are the most common housing type, with hundreds of students living in rooms meant for two people, with exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the mix of cultures and ages in my neighborhood. Professional staff tend to live in houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Moving forward, stores and parks make up the remaining aspects of my neighborhood. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from typical dining options to the school's own branded clothing and grocery stores, ensuring all necessities are available within the neighborhood. The park is a popular gathering spot for the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the neighborhood community itself.",
            "After spending roughly 10 years in this neighborhood, I can certainly share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite tough for me. I was heartbroken to leave behind my old home and friends, but my parents were eager for a better future for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered improved housing and a better high school, which was seen as a step up from what we were used to. Over the years, I adapted to my new surroundings and formed new friendships, albeit some were less than ideal. I never got to know most of my neighbors deeply, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They’ve been a source of joy and support, almost like family. I particularly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where he re-married. It was a fun and memorable event, and it got me thinking about my own future. I even caught the bride's garter! Although I didn't catch the bouquet, we all danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I haven’t seen her since but hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it more freely. I’ve only ventured a bit, mostly hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We enjoyed our time playing video games and taking life easy. Sometimes, I’d visit the park and find solace in nature, practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot and even bringing my bokken wooden sword. I also enjoy the basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a long time. My father and best friend, Mr. Graves, taught us tennis, and we always had a great time despite the rigorous training. I have plenty of happy memories here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "The college I attend is close to my neighborhood, which I enjoy for its proximity to the school. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but still offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are college students or have lower incomes, a reflection of the affordable housing. An elementary school is nearby, and my neighborhood has a mix of friendly and younger residents. My neighbors are not well-known to me, and their smoking habits have led to an air freshener unit being installed outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are mostly older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, new apartments have been constructed, although their quality is questionable, and the rent is higher than it should be due to their campus proximity. A nearby restaurant serves food on paper plates and uses microwaves, while across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. A city-funded road improvement project has made the area look nicer with a new sidewalk and landscaped medians. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although some have been removed, leaving stumps, while behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is more appealing than 43rd, which has poorly maintained sidewalks and shabby buildings. While crime is an issue in the surrounding apartment complexes, I appreciate living where I do due to its affordability and convenient amenities. The university and two bus stops are within walking distance, making it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood comprises a series of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced irregularly to mimic individual houses, the only distinct feature being their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Residents are largely friendly with one another. On some evenings, we gather at the end of an unplanned driveway, chatting as neighborhood children engage in play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing respite from our tech-savvy world, almost as if we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. The only recent challenge has been the tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens, and I found myself seeking shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road steamed as temperatures dropped from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I hurried to capture it on camera. The neighborhood remained quiet for a while, then returned to normal, with people coming home and families going about their evening routines. I appreciate this friendly community, which is like a small village. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most here. While the exteriors are similar, interiors vary, some quite small. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, seeing deer, and hearing morning rooster crowing and the evening donkey braying. It's a wonderful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood right as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but eventually, I developed strong bonds with a couple of kids living nearby. Although they no longer reside there, the memories remain. The original residents who lived here when I first moved in are still around for the most part. My neighborhood is quite typical of an average American suburb, featuring numerous two-story homes. On warm weekends, children's laughter fills the air as they play outside. Most days, the neighborhood is peaceful. I've never encountered any issues with neighbors, and the community is generally welcoming. I've ordered numerous online packages without any issues, and I trust my neighbors implicitly. A park is just a short walk from my house, where I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. Although I had a unpleasant experience there once, getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the happy memories far outweigh the bad ones. Now, I often visit the park with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes many nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many residents now prefer food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. While fast-food chains are prevalent, the area also has several pizza places and a range of stores to cater to every need. There's a dry cleaner, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood, and seeing news reports of other people's negative experiences with neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "The town of Johnston, a sleepy little place in South Carolina, isn't particularly remarkable, but it plays a substantial role in agriculture. It's renowned as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with expansive fields mainly dedicated to peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are typically two-story structures, spaced far from the road, with either metal roofs to beat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. The town's commercial center is minimal, featuring only a single stoplight at an intersection where the three main stores lie: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is the sole option for groceries, with many residents preferring to shop at a nearby Walmart. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. There's a small, community-known furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman. Attached to it is a pet grooming service, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Medical care is provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both situated away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the younger students, while middle and high school students attend schools in the next town. The town lacks parks, but a new 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to provide family activities and attract more residents. Entertainment options are limited, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or diverse dining choices. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a pleasant town, so small that one could pass through without noticing.",
            "The initial time I found out about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment around was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's due to the financial struggles. Some of my friends have mentioned that they cry themselves to sleep at night because of the expensive living costs. We've adapted to being frugal over time. You get used to the dusty scent of flea market toys and moth-eaten clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you might just be accustomed to the current situation. But the flea market persists. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It sticks in the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you wouldn't hear that noise inside the thrift stores. Regardless of the outside activity, the stores are peaceful and a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. It's the headquarters of one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, still experiencing some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really cares about you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue its rhythm like waves on a beach. It's an energetic place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always some sort of activity. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are quite kind to me. I try to keep my space clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I help with each other's mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't entirely ruined my life.",
            "The residential area where I live can be characterized as quintessential suburban living. The neighborhood is dominated by a homeowner's association, whose diligent efforts are evident in the pristine condition of the single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll find immaculate front yards, each with a small patch of greenery, decorative stones, and compact driveways. Scattered trees add to the landscaping. Every home features a two-car garage. As you navigate the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved roads, free of defects like potholes. While most homes are single-story, a few are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, located at the end of the street, with individual keys necessary for access. Larger lockers handle package deliveries. This uniformity is due to the HOA's stringent rules. My neighborhood lies at the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements. The size of the area allows for ample space, including several community pools and walking trails that ensure residents stay active without leaving the neighborhood. The community is primarily composed of retirees and is considered safe and close-knit, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is sizable but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a single mall that meets basic shopping needs. Major retail stores can be reached in about 15 minutes, making it convenient for residents to shop. The area is well-maintained and offers a high quality of life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just outside of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is typically considered the most economically challenged part of town. Here, property values are low, and many homes are rented to or owned by low-income residents. While it might not be the most aesthetically pleasing area, it's not unpleasant either. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me warmly when I walk by. Crime rates are somewhat higher than other parts of town, but they're still relatively low. There have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has fortunately not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch. The town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere that has helped him thrive despite his special needs. We have an active PTO planning events to foster family involvement and academic progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated unfairly due to their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center of town and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, our home is comfortable, and we've lived here for over 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture, perched on a hill with historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex across from an old live theater, and a few blocks down, there's a lively arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. Evenings in June and July often find people waiting in line to enter. A short distance away is a large city park, surrounded by concrete with tall steps leading up to it. During winter, particularly when it rains heavily, homeless individuals set up tents in rows along the sidewalks and steps. While snowfall is minimal, the rain can make it challenging to stay warm. Their tents, close to the city center and the nearest family center for miles, provide warmth and easy access to basic services. My affection for the city isn't for its historic architecture, though the tall buildings and rolling hills leading to the ocean are impressive. What I love about my neighborhood is the resilience and community spirit of the people. Once infamous for gang violence, Hilltop's history is still vividly recounted today. Despite the ongoing reputation, residents work hard to keep the area clean and safe. The warnings about not walking alone at night for white people recall the past, tinged with social conditioning. As someone who doesn't entirely fit the mold, I have found acceptance and kindness from the community. It's a place where night walks feel alive, with people offering help rather than harm. Laundromats stay open late to accommodate my needs, and even on the gloomiest nights, strangers show kindness, reminding me of my worth.",
            "I reside in a rural area of Michigan, specifically in a small town. Instead of big city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, you'll find farmland transitioning into small tourist destinations. My home is nestled near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you turn, there's a beach to enjoy. The neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe: older homes, some updated, others retaining their original charm, with full basements visible from the road. Many homes feature aluminum siding and yards complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect a hardworking community, with children and families at the heart. Neighbors are engaged, friendly, and maintain their properties. The area is peaceful, safe, and quiet, with green lawns and well-maintained plants. Nearby are a sheriff's department, health department, city recycling center, sports fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. My kids can bike to the park just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, located in a bustling metropolis, is incredibly diverse. Residential zones are scattered among commercial areas that house a mix of offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, ranging from big-name corporate stores to trendy, locally-owned boutiques. Some of these shops line the streets, bringing a lively atmosphere to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods. Nearby parks are popular among families with young children. The neighborhood is also home to several distinct communities, such as a prominent LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding slightly beyond my immediate area reveals more diverse communities, including Little Korea, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving; a mere 10 miles may take two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most residents prefer cars over walking, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking issues. Despite this, the city has seen significant construction with new apartments being built, much to the dismay of many long-term residents who fear more congestion.

My home has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, reflecting the American dream of suburban living that once captivated our country. Though that dream seems to be waning, remnants of it remain, like my neighborhood and others, hinting at its enduring allure. While optimism and yard maintenance have declined, cars still populate driveways, and kids still play as if the world is their playground. The century-old public school still stands, inspiring both today's youth and stirring nostalgic memories in older residents. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Though each home is distinctive, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket, \"Super A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. Wide streets allow kids to play football, pausing briefly to let cars pass. Most residents have deep roots here, with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school is now a pharmacy, and an old movie theater shows classic films at discounted prices, attracting older residents but not the youth. A single expressway runs through our town, with exits and entrances in the neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was rejected due to fears of ruining the neighborhood, a decision supported by the youth and opposed by the elders.

Nestled here are several apartment complexes, arranged in a tightly packed, linear fashion, much like Russian nesting dolls.

Across from these complexes lies a quiet community college satellite campus, where students begin their days with coffee in hand, as commuters grumble at the traffic delays on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, bordering a park and a rehabilitation center for injured individuals. The center's cheerful porch furniture and lazy ceiling fan create a welcoming atmosphere, while children play and old residents walk their dogs. The neighborhood is a blend of modern and timeless, with a sushi restaurant, swimming supply store, nail salon, and frozen yogurt shop nearby.

            "She inquired, \"Where is everything?\" as we cruised past the endless cornfields. \"This is it!\" I exclaimed, anticipating her surprise at the expansiveness of the open landscape. She hailed from a city where the nearest grocery store was a short walk away, so she'd never encountered such vast open spaces before.

The vibrant flowers of spring transform into snowy landscapes, and the backyard becomes a winter wonderland with snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I often fought, using snowballs as our weapons and building igloo-like forts.",
            "Portland, Oregon is renowned for its eccentricity, encapsulated by its unofficial slogan \"Keep Portland Weird\", prominently displayed on a multifunctional building that houses a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and strip club while operating in a legal gray area. This slogan serves as a reminder of the city's past, when it was a creative and unique haven, and also as an invitation to embrace the city's unconventional atmosphere. The influx of wealthy Californians and construction of new condos have not dampened Portland's spirit, which remains accepting of the unusual. While Portland has modern amenities and issues like drug abuse and homelessness, it also features a vibrant community of yogis, hipsters, and professionals. The quirkiness of Portland is not about rejecting normality but rather taking it lightly. Neighborhoods are characterized by colorful homes, lush gardens, and free boxes containing treasures that often include clothes and books. This unexpected delight is a part of what makes Portland unique. The city's diversity includes people who participate in goat yoga or soccer matches, and while there are mental health and homelessness challenges, Portland is also a place of care and dreams.",
            "The mountains are ever-present, standing vigilant as the sun rises and sets each day. Regardless of how busy or distracted I become, they remain unyielding, undeterred by life's challenges. In times of stress, they call out to me, and when I look to them, they offer solace and strength, helping me carry on day by day. I moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my first captivating sight. While the university itself is a beautiful place with its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is lovely as well, with charming cafes where I spent many hours studying, and a bustling downtown area that contrasts with its quiet, small-town streets. This mix of environments creates a unique atmosphere, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories. From late-night walks in the park to movie nights in town, the town holds both joyful and painful memories. The ponds are especially conducive to reflection and quiet moments. I often found myself contemplating life's purpose while watching the creatures there. One day, as I walked past the pond and through the park, I reached a main street. The sun rose, casting its golden rays on the palm trees, and I realized I was heading north. There, I saw the mountains, their solid presence filling the sky, reigniting my resolve.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding it shouldn't be a problem—public transportation is readily available and popular throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel you're in the heart of the city. During your stay, you'll encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents, resulting in Asian-owned businesses on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common and popular among locals, offering excellent quality food at affordable prices and convenient locations. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other near where I live. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, it's diverse with immigrants and their children living here. Many large local businesses are Asian-owned. There's also a nearby park that's been recently renovated, featuring ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. The park is diverse, with people from various backgrounds getting along well. Corporate buildings aren't prevalent; instead, you'll find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and many are friendly but noisy, with frequent car noise and occasional dog waste on the streets. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's important to be cautious, as there have been incidents of bullying and package theft. I've personally experienced physical assault in the past, but these incidents are less common nowadays. Additionally, there's a lack of adherence to the city's regulations regarding dog waste, leading to a significant amount of it on the streets. Keep your shoes clean, as dog waste is a common issue in the neighborhood.",
            "In my residential area, there's a scarcity of sidewalks. The terrain slopes downward, placing my house at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, dubbed the \"work out hill\" by locals for its popularity among joggers. Lacking sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk along the road, which is rough and dangerous to drive on. Power lines and telephone wires are in disrepair, often damaged by storms and debris. Towering evergreens surround the area, but they're unpopular due to blocking ocean views, leading to many residents building houses high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are spectacular, with the water's reflection creating a glow, though it's often cloudy and damp, resulting in a moist environment where moss thrives. Children are few, and the neighborhood is primarily inhabited by elderly residents and their dogs, which are often seen in yards or on the streets. Gardens and lawns are frequently undermined by rabbits, while various birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be spotted. There are no stores nearby, but a few waterfront restaurants serve local seafood. The bay is narrow, allowing visibility of the opposite shore most days, and the rocky shoreline is good for tossing stones into the water.",
            "Our home is situated in a typical residential area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Being located at the junction of two state highways, we experience a bit more traffic than we'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains mostly quiet. With a relatively stable population, I'm familiar with most of my neighbors, who generally keep to themselves and focus on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house at the end of the street allows us to see most of the neighborhood's comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars driven by our neighbors. Unusual vehicles catch our attention. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on their bikes. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. We work from home and are often outside playing, even in the rain. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the aroma of barbecue fills the air. The lawn mowing season runs from March to October, with leaves being raked and burned in the fall, which I also like as a sign of the season. The neighborhood is wooded, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf cleanup. Recent winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless expecting guests, which is uncommon. I enjoy tinkering in the garage, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, but some families visit from out of town, with extra vehicles parked on the street. All in all, I'm fond of living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the desert, where dust is abundant, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating substantial care and expense. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but the area has seen considerable development with new additions, making it increasingly urban-like. The community is generally welcoming, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is populated by friendly seniors, and the shops are mostly chain establishments, with few independent stores. The primary employment sector here is construction, given the city's undeveloped areas. I've grown fond of the unique wildlife, which includes lizards and desert insects, although I prefer this location over my previous big-city home. Victorville offers attractions like the San Bernardino County Fair and nearby snow-capped mountains, while the Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's natural history and culture.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I might describe it in a way that's a bit different. While typical answers might come from homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation is unique. My neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I live, with my dormitory residents being my community, and the surrounding campus as my extended neighborhood. While this is unconventional, my neighborhood shares some common elements with traditional neighborhoods, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the types of \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to note the three types of housing I reside in: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, rooms typically house 2-4 people with 4-6 rooms per floor, and a building can accommodate around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents. These houses are fewer in number due to their lower efficiency. Finally, dormitories are the most common housing type, with hundreds of students living in rooms meant for two people, with exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the mix of cultures and ages in my neighborhood. Professional staff tend to live in houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Moving forward, stores and parks make up the remaining aspects of my neighborhood. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from typical dining options to the school's own branded clothing and grocery stores, ensuring all necessities are available within the neighborhood. The park is a popular gathering spot for the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the neighborhood community itself.",
            "After spending roughly 10 years in this neighborhood, I can certainly share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite tough for me. I was heartbroken to leave behind my old home and friends, but my parents were eager for a better future for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered improved housing and a better high school, which was seen as a step up from what we were used to. Over the years, I adapted to my new surroundings and formed new friendships, albeit some were less than ideal. I never got to know most of my neighbors deeply, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They’ve been a source of joy and support, almost like family. I particularly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where he re-married. It was a fun and memorable event, and it got me thinking about my own future. I even caught the bride's garter! Although I didn't catch the bouquet, we all danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I haven’t seen her since but hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it more freely. I’ve only ventured a bit, mostly hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We enjoyed our time playing video games and taking life easy. Sometimes, I’d visit the park and find solace in nature, practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot and even bringing my bokken wooden sword. I also enjoy the basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a long time. My father and best friend, Mr. Graves, taught us tennis, and we always had a great time despite the rigorous training. I have plenty of happy memories here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "The college I attend is close to my neighborhood, which I enjoy for its proximity to the school. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but still offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are college students or have lower incomes, a reflection of the affordable housing. An elementary school is nearby, and my neighborhood has a mix of friendly and younger residents. My neighbors are not well-known to me, and their smoking habits have led to an air freshener unit being installed outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are mostly older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, new apartments have been constructed, although their quality is questionable, and the rent is higher than it should be due to their campus proximity. A nearby restaurant serves food on paper plates and uses microwaves, while across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. A city-funded road improvement project has made the area look nicer with a new sidewalk and landscaped medians. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although some have been removed, leaving stumps, while behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is more appealing than 43rd, which has poorly maintained sidewalks and shabby buildings. While crime is an issue in the surrounding apartment complexes, I appreciate living where I do due to its affordability and convenient amenities. The university and two bus stops are within walking distance, making it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood comprises a series of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced irregularly to mimic individual houses, the only distinct feature being their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Residents are largely friendly with one another. On some evenings, we gather at the end of an unplanned driveway, chatting as neighborhood children engage in play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing respite from our tech-savvy world, almost as if we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. The only recent challenge has been the tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens, and I found myself seeking shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road steamed as temperatures dropped from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I hurried to capture it on camera. The neighborhood remained quiet for a while, then returned to normal, with people coming home and families going about their evening routines. I appreciate this friendly community, which is like a small village. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most here. While the exteriors are similar, interiors vary, some quite small. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, seeing deer, and hearing morning rooster crowing and the evening donkey braying. It's a wonderful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood right as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but eventually, I developed strong bonds with a couple of kids living nearby. Although they no longer reside there, the memories remain. The original residents who lived here when I first moved in are still around for the most part. My neighborhood is quite typical of an average American suburb, featuring numerous two-story homes. On warm weekends, children's laughter fills the air as they play outside. Most days, the neighborhood is peaceful. I've never encountered any issues with neighbors, and the community is generally welcoming. I've ordered numerous online packages without any issues, and I trust my neighbors implicitly. A park is just a short walk from my house, where I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. Although I had a unpleasant experience there once, getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the happy memories far outweigh the bad ones. Now, I often visit the park with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes many nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many residents now prefer food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. While fast-food chains are prevalent, the area also has several pizza places and a range of stores to cater to every need. There's a dry cleaner, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood, and seeing news reports of other people's negative experiences with neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "The town of Johnston, a sleepy little place in South Carolina, isn't particularly remarkable, but it plays a substantial role in agriculture. It's renowned as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with expansive fields mainly dedicated to peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are typically two-story structures, spaced far from the road, with either metal roofs to beat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. The town's commercial center is minimal, featuring only a single stoplight at an intersection where the three main stores lie: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is the sole option for groceries, with many residents preferring to shop at a nearby Walmart. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. There's a small, community-known furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman. Attached to it is a pet grooming service, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Medical care is provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both situated away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the younger students, while middle and high school students attend schools in the next town. The town lacks parks, but a new 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to provide family activities and attract more residents. Entertainment options are limited, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or diverse dining choices. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a pleasant town, so small that one could pass through without noticing.",
            "The initial time I found out about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment around was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's due to the financial struggles. Some of my friends have mentioned that they cry themselves to sleep at night because of the expensive living costs. We've adapted to being frugal over time. You get used to the dusty scent of flea market toys and moth-eaten clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you might just be accustomed to the current situation. But the flea market persists. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It sticks in the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you wouldn't hear that noise inside the thrift stores. Regardless of the outside activity, the stores are peaceful and a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. It's the headquarters of one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, still experiencing some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really cares about you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue its rhythm like waves on a beach. It's an energetic place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always some sort of activity. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are quite kind to me. I try to keep my space clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I help with each other's mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't entirely ruined my life.",
            "The residential area where I live can be characterized as quintessential suburban living. The neighborhood is dominated by a homeowner's association, whose diligent efforts are evident in the pristine condition of the single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll find immaculate front yards, each with a small patch of greenery, decorative stones, and compact driveways. Scattered trees add to the landscaping. Every home features a two-car garage. As you navigate the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved roads, free of defects like potholes. While most homes are single-story, a few are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, located at the end of the street, with individual keys necessary for access. Larger lockers handle package deliveries. This uniformity is due to the HOA's stringent rules. My neighborhood lies at the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements. The size of the area allows for ample space, including several community pools and walking trails that ensure residents stay active without leaving the neighborhood. The community is primarily composed of retirees and is considered safe and close-knit, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is sizable but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a single mall that meets basic shopping needs. Major retail stores can be reached in about 15 minutes, making it convenient for residents to shop. The area is well-maintained and offers a high quality of life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just outside of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is typically considered the most economically challenged part of town. Here, property values are low, and many homes are rented to or owned by low-income residents. While it might not be the most aesthetically pleasing area, it's not unpleasant either. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me warmly when I walk by. Crime rates are somewhat higher than other parts of town, but they're still relatively low. There have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has fortunately not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch. The town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere that has helped him thrive despite his special needs. We have an active PTO planning events to foster family involvement and academic progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated unfairly due to their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center of town and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, our home is comfortable, and we've lived here for over 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture, perched on a hill with historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex across from an old live theater, and a few blocks down, there's a lively arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. Evenings in June and July often find people waiting in line to enter. A short distance away is a large city park, surrounded by concrete with tall steps leading up to it. During winter, particularly when it rains heavily, homeless individuals set up tents in rows along the sidewalks and steps. While snowfall is minimal, the rain can make it challenging to stay warm. Their tents, close to the city center and the nearest family center for miles, provide warmth and easy access to basic services. My affection for the city isn't for its historic architecture, though the tall buildings and rolling hills leading to the ocean are impressive. What I love about my neighborhood is the resilience and community spirit of the people. Once infamous for gang violence, Hilltop's history is still vividly recounted today. Despite the ongoing reputation, residents work hard to keep the area clean and safe. The warnings about not walking alone at night for white people recall the past, tinged with social conditioning. As someone who doesn't entirely fit the mold, I have found acceptance and kindness from the community. It's a place where night walks feel alive, with people offering help rather than harm. Laundromats stay open late to accommodate my needs, and even on the gloomiest nights, strangers show kindness, reminding me of my worth.",
            "I reside in a rural area of Michigan, specifically in a small town. Instead of big city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, you'll find farmland transitioning into small tourist destinations. My home is nestled near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you turn, there's a beach to enjoy. The neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe: older homes, some updated, others retaining their original charm, with full basements visible from the road. Many homes feature aluminum siding and yards complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect a hardworking community, with children and families at the heart. Neighbors are engaged, friendly, and maintain their properties. The area is peaceful, safe, and quiet, with green lawns and well-maintained plants. Nearby are a sheriff's department, health department, city recycling center, sports fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. My kids can bike to the park just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to raise a family."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood, located in a bustling metropolis, is incredibly diverse. Residential zones are scattered among commercial areas that house a mix of offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, ranging from big-name corporate stores to trendy, locally-owned boutiques. Some of these shops line the streets, bringing a lively atmosphere to what would otherwise be quiet neighborhoods. Nearby parks are popular among families with young children. The neighborhood is also home to several distinct communities, such as a prominent LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding slightly beyond my immediate area reveals more diverse communities, including Little Korea, China Town, and Little Armenia. However, distances can be deceiving; a mere 10 miles may take two hours due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours. Most residents prefer cars over walking, leading to some of the world's worst traffic congestion and parking issues. Despite this, the city has seen significant construction with new apartments being built, much to the dismay of many long-term residents who fear more congestion.

My home has a small front yard and a driveway to its left, reflecting the American dream of suburban living that once captivated our country. Though that dream seems to be waning, remnants of it remain, like my neighborhood and others, hinting at its enduring allure. While optimism and yard maintenance have declined, cars still populate driveways, and kids still play as if the world is their playground. The century-old public school still stands, inspiring both today's youth and stirring nostalgic memories in older residents. Churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full. Though each home is distinctive, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket, \"Super A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. Wide streets allow kids to play football, pausing briefly to let cars pass. Most residents have deep roots here, with stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. A former karate school is now a pharmacy, and an old movie theater shows classic films at discounted prices, attracting older residents but not the youth. A single expressway runs through our town, with exits and entrances in the neighboring town. A proposed exit for our town was rejected due to fears of ruining the neighborhood, a decision supported by the youth and opposed by the elders.

This slogan serves as a reminder of the city's past, when it was a creative and unique haven, and also as an invitation to embrace the city's unconventional atmosphere. The influx of wealthy Californians and construction of new condos have not dampened Portland's spirit, which remains accepting of the unusual. While Portland has modern amenities and issues like drug abuse and homelessness, it also features a vibrant community of yogis, hipsters, and professionals. The quirkiness of Portland is not about rejecting normality but rather taking it lightly. Neighborhoods are characterized by colorful homes, lush gardens, and free boxes containing treasures that often include clothes and books. This unexpected delight is a part of what makes Portland unique. The city's diversity includes people who participate in goat yoga or soccer matches, and while there are mental health and homelessness challenges, Portland is also a place of care and dreams.",
            "The mountains are ever-present, standing vigilant as the sun rises and sets each day. Regardless of how busy or distracted I become, they remain unyielding, undeterred by life's challenges. In times of stress, they call out to me, and when I look to them, they offer solace and strength, helping me carry on day by day. I moved here for my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were my first captivating sight. While the university itself is a beautiful place with its buildings, ponds, and trees, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town is lovely as well, with charming cafes where I spent many hours studying, and a bustling downtown area that contrasts with its quiet, small-town streets. This mix of environments creates a unique atmosphere, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories. From late-night walks in the park to movie nights in town, the town holds both joyful and painful memories. The ponds are especially conducive to reflection and quiet moments. I often found myself contemplating life's purpose while watching the creatures there. One day, as I walked past the pond and through the park, I reached a main street. The sun rose, casting its golden rays on the palm trees, and I realized I was heading north. There, I saw the mountains, their solid presence filling the sky, reigniting my resolve.",
            "If you're thinking of visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding it shouldn't be a problem—public transportation is readily available and popular throughout New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel you're in the heart of the city. During your stay, you'll encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents, resulting in Asian-owned businesses on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common and popular among locals, offering excellent quality food at affordable prices and convenient locations. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other near where I live. While Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian, it's diverse with immigrants and their children living here. Many large local businesses are Asian-owned. There's also a nearby park that's been recently renovated, featuring ten basketball courts, a large field for sports, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and a water fountain. The park is diverse, with people from various backgrounds getting along well. Corporate buildings aren't prevalent; instead, you'll find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments. Most residents live in two-family houses, and many are friendly but noisy, with frequent car noise and occasional dog waste on the streets. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's important to be cautious, as there have been incidents of bullying and package theft. I've personally experienced physical assault in the past, but these incidents are less common nowadays. Additionally, there's a lack of adherence to the city's regulations regarding dog waste, leading to a significant amount of it on the streets. Keep your shoes clean, as dog waste is a common issue in the neighborhood.",
            "In my residential area, there's a scarcity of sidewalks. The terrain slopes downward, placing my house at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood, dubbed the \"work out hill\" by locals for its popularity among joggers. Lacking sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk along the road, which is rough and dangerous to drive on. Power lines and telephone wires are in disrepair, often damaged by storms and debris. Towering evergreens surround the area, but they're unpopular due to blocking ocean views, leading to many residents building houses high up on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories. Sunsets here are spectacular, with the water's reflection creating a glow, though it's often cloudy and damp, resulting in a moist environment where moss thrives. Children are few, and the neighborhood is primarily inhabited by elderly residents and their dogs, which are often seen in yards or on the streets. Gardens and lawns are frequently undermined by rabbits, while various birds and the occasional hawk or eagle can be spotted. There are no stores nearby, but a few waterfront restaurants serve local seafood. The bay is narrow, allowing visibility of the opposite shore most days, and the rocky shoreline is good for tossing stones into the water.",
            "Our home is situated in a typical residential area of a small southern town in Tennessee. Being located at the junction of two state highways, we experience a bit more traffic than we'd prefer, but the neighborhood remains mostly quiet. With a relatively stable population, I'm familiar with most of my neighbors, who generally keep to themselves and focus on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down the hill on our side street. Our house at the end of the street allows us to see most of the neighborhood's comings and goings, and we're familiar with the cars driven by our neighbors. Unusual vehicles catch our attention. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and children play on their bikes. We're a family of four - myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen. We work from home and are often outside playing, even in the rain. We enjoy grilling on our back deck, and the aroma of barbecue fills the air. The lawn mowing season runs from March to October, with leaves being raked and burned in the fall, which I also like as a sign of the season. The neighborhood is wooded, providing ample shade but also requiring regular leaf cleanup. Recent winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged fall. Our garage is at the rear of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless expecting guests, which is uncommon. I enjoy tinkering in the garage, and having the garage doors open makes me more attuned to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet, but some families visit from out of town, with extra vehicles parked on the street. All in all, I'm fond of living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the desert, where dust is abundant, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating substantial care and expense. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spaced far apart, but the area has seen considerable development with new additions, making it increasingly urban-like. The community is generally welcoming, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is populated by friendly seniors, and the shops are mostly chain establishments, with few independent stores. The primary employment sector here is construction, given the city's undeveloped areas. I've grown fond of the unique wildlife, which includes lizards and desert insects, although I prefer this location over my previous big-city home. Victorville offers attractions like the San Bernardino County Fair and nearby snow-capped mountains, while the Victor Valley Museum showcases the area's natural history and culture.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I might describe it in a way that's a bit different. While typical answers might come from homeowners with their own personal lives, my situation is unique. My neighborhood is essentially the college campus where I live, with my dormitory residents being my community, and the surrounding campus as my extended neighborhood. While this is unconventional, my neighborhood shares some common elements with traditional neighborhoods, such as houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the types of \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to note the three types of housing I reside in: apartments, actual houses, and dormitories. In apartments, rooms typically house 2-4 people with 4-6 rooms per floor, and a building can accommodate around 20 people. Actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually with 2-4 bedrooms and alumni residents. These houses are fewer in number due to their lower efficiency. Finally, dormitories are the most common housing type, with hundreds of students living in rooms meant for two people, with exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the mix of cultures and ages in my neighborhood. Professional staff tend to live in houses, while newer students stay in dormitories and older students in apartments. Moving forward, stores and parks make up the remaining aspects of my neighborhood. Given that my school is largely self-contained, it offers a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from typical dining options to the school's own branded clothing and grocery stores, ensuring all necessities are available within the neighborhood. The park is a popular gathering spot for the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the neighborhood community itself.",
            "After spending roughly 10 years in this neighborhood, I can certainly share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite tough for me. I was heartbroken to leave behind my old home and friends, but my parents were eager for a better future for my sister and me. Our new neighborhood offered improved housing and a better high school, which was seen as a step up from what we were used to. Over the years, I adapted to my new surroundings and formed new friendships, albeit some were less than ideal. I never got to know most of my neighbors deeply, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They’ve been a source of joy and support, almost like family. I particularly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding, where he re-married. It was a fun and memorable event, and it got me thinking about my own future. I even caught the bride's garter! Although I didn't catch the bouquet, we all danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I haven’t seen her since but hope she’s doing well.\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but now I have a GPS to explore it more freely. I’ve only ventured a bit, mostly hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We enjoyed our time playing video games and taking life easy. Sometimes, I’d visit the park and find solace in nature, practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot and even bringing my bokken wooden sword. I also enjoy the basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a long time. My father and best friend, Mr. Graves, taught us tennis, and we always had a great time despite the rigorous training. I have plenty of happy memories here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "The college I attend is close to my neighborhood, which I enjoy for its proximity to the school. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are affordable and enjoyable. One bar recently changed its name and is pricier, but still offers decent service and drinks. Most residents are college students or have lower incomes, a reflection of the affordable housing. An elementary school is nearby, and my neighborhood has a mix of friendly and younger residents. My neighbors are not well-known to me, and their smoking habits have led to an air freshener unit being installed outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings around me are mostly older, but some have been renovated. Down the street, new apartments have been constructed, although their quality is questionable, and the rent is higher than it should be due to their campus proximity. A nearby restaurant serves food on paper plates and uses microwaves, while across from it is a gas station with a questionable reputation. A city-funded road improvement project has made the area look nicer with a new sidewalk and landscaped medians. My apartment is surrounded by trees, although some have been removed, leaving stumps, while behind my building is a tree line and another set of apartments. My street, 42nd, is more appealing than 43rd, which has poorly maintained sidewalks and shabby buildings. While crime is an issue in the surrounding apartment complexes, I appreciate living where I do due to its affordability and convenient amenities. The university and two bus stops are within walking distance, making it easy for me to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood comprises a series of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, spaced irregularly to mimic individual houses, the only distinct feature being their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Residents are largely friendly with one another. On some evenings, we gather at the end of an unplanned driveway, chatting as neighborhood children engage in play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing respite from our tech-savvy world, almost as if we've stepped back in time. We're surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies dotted with white clouds. The only recent challenge has been the tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens, and I found myself seeking shelter in the bathtub with my little dog, purse, and pillows, while my larger dog remained in the living room, barking nervously. The storm brought hail, and the road steamed as temperatures dropped from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted quickly on the hot pavement. After the storm, a double rainbow appeared, and I hurried to capture it on camera. The neighborhood remained quiet for a while, then returned to normal, with people coming home and families going about their evening routines. I appreciate this friendly community, which is like a small village. I live in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most here. While the exteriors are similar, interiors vary, some quite small. I enjoy walking to the nearby pond, seeing deer, and hearing morning rooster crowing and the evening donkey braying. It's a wonderful place to live, just a short drive from Charlotte.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood right as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but eventually, I developed strong bonds with a couple of kids living nearby. Although they no longer reside there, the memories remain. The original residents who lived here when I first moved in are still around for the most part. My neighborhood is quite typical of an average American suburb, featuring numerous two-story homes. On warm weekends, children's laughter fills the air as they play outside. Most days, the neighborhood is peaceful. I've never encountered any issues with neighbors, and the community is generally welcoming. I've ordered numerous online packages without any issues, and I trust my neighbors implicitly. A park is just a short walk from my house, where I have fond memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with my neighborhood friends. Although I had a unpleasant experience there once, getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the happy memories far outweigh the bad ones. Now, I often visit the park with my cousin's younger kids, who still enjoy the playground equipment. The park evokes many nostalgic feelings in me. The neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many residents now prefer food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. While fast-food chains are prevalent, the area also has several pizza places and a range of stores to cater to every need. There's a dry cleaner, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco grocery store, and even an Indian-owned store for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood, and seeing news reports of other people's negative experiences with neighbors makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "The town of Johnston, a sleepy little place in South Carolina, isn't particularly remarkable, but it plays a substantial role in agriculture. It's renowned as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" a title proudly displayed on its welcoming sign. The town is largely rural, with expansive fields mainly dedicated to peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are typically two-story structures, spaced far from the road, with either metal roofs to beat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. The town's commercial center is minimal, featuring only a single stoplight at an intersection where the three main stores lie: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain). A local pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. A small, pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is the sole option for groceries, with many residents preferring to shop at a nearby Walmart. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items. There's a small, community-known furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman. Attached to it is a pet grooming service, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Medical care is provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both situated away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the younger students, while middle and high school students attend schools in the next town. The town lacks parks, but a new 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to provide family activities and attract more residents. Entertainment options are limited, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or diverse dining choices. Despite its simplicity, Johnston is a pleasant town, so small that one could pass through without noticing.",
            "The initial time I found out about my place, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment around was renting for over a thousand dollars a month. I hadn't heard about this before, and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's due to the financial struggles. Some of my friends have mentioned that they cry themselves to sleep at night because of the expensive living costs. We've adapted to being frugal over time. You get used to the dusty scent of flea market toys and moth-eaten clothes. You smell less in adulthood. You might start smoking, or you might just be accustomed to the current situation. But the flea market persists. The smell of adulthood is dusty old magazines stacked on a closed piano. It sticks in the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you wouldn't hear that noise inside the thrift stores. Regardless of the outside activity, the stores are peaceful and a great place to spend an afternoon. Each year, there are more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. It's the headquarters of one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, still experiencing some growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and no one really cares about you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will continue its rhythm like waves on a beach. It's an energetic place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always some sort of activity. In a way, we have less of an apartment full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. I feel fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are quite kind to me. I try to keep my space clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I help with each other's mail, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't entirely ruined my life.",
            "The residential area where I live can be characterized as quintessential suburban living. The neighborhood is dominated by a homeowner's association, whose diligent efforts are evident in the pristine condition of the single-family homes. Upon entering, you'll find immaculate front yards, each with a small patch of greenery, decorative stones, and compact driveways. Scattered trees add to the landscaping. Every home features a two-car garage. As you navigate the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved roads, free of defects like potholes. While most homes are single-story, a few are two-story. Mailboxes are communal, located at the end of the street, with individual keys necessary for access. Larger lockers handle package deliveries. This uniformity is due to the HOA's stringent rules. My neighborhood lies at the outskirts of a nearby city, blending rural and suburban elements. The size of the area allows for ample space, including several community pools and walking trails that ensure residents stay active without leaving the neighborhood. The community is primarily composed of retirees and is considered safe and close-knit, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is sizable but retains a small-town feel. It offers most common amenities, including a single mall that meets basic shopping needs. Major retail stores can be reached in about 15 minutes, making it convenient for residents to shop. The area is well-maintained and offers a high quality of life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just outside of a major city's suburban areas. My immediate neighborhood, situated on the east side, is typically considered the most economically challenged part of town. Here, property values are low, and many homes are rented to or owned by low-income residents. While it might not be the most aesthetically pleasing area, it's not unpleasant either. My neighbors are generally friendly, greeting me warmly when I walk by. Crime rates are somewhat higher than other parts of town, but they're still relatively low. There have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Our family has fortunately not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional missing item from our porch. The town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff and a positive atmosphere that has helped him thrive despite his special needs. We have an active PTO planning events to foster family involvement and academic progress. Since over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students. No child or family is treated unfairly due to their financial situation, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating parks, but most of these improvements have been focused on the center of town and the west side, where shopping areas are located. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living here. People are friendly, the schools are great, there are sufficient shopping options, our home is comfortable, and we've lived here for over 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture, perched on a hill with historic buildings. I reside in a 7-story apartment complex across from an old live theater, and a few blocks down, there's a lively arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. Evenings in June and July often find people waiting in line to enter. A short distance away is a large city park, surrounded by concrete with tall steps leading up to it. During winter, particularly when it rains heavily, homeless individuals set up tents in rows along the sidewalks and steps. While snowfall is minimal, the rain can make it challenging to stay warm. Their tents, close to the city center and the nearest family center for miles, provide warmth and easy access to basic services. My affection for the city isn't for its historic architecture, though the tall buildings and rolling hills leading to the ocean are impressive. What I love about my neighborhood is the resilience and community spirit of the people. Once infamous for gang violence, Hilltop's history is still vividly recounted today. Despite the ongoing reputation, residents work hard to keep the area clean and safe. The warnings about not walking alone at night for white people recall the past, tinged with social conditioning. As someone who doesn't entirely fit the mold, I have found acceptance and kindness from the community. It's a place where night walks feel alive, with people offering help rather than harm. Laundromats stay open late to accommodate my needs, and even on the gloomiest nights, strangers show kindness, reminding me of my worth.",
            "I reside in a rural area of Michigan, specifically in a small town. Instead of big city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, you'll find farmland transitioning into small tourist destinations. My home is nestled near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan to the east and Lake Charlevoix to the west. Everywhere you turn, there's a beach to enjoy. The neighborhood embodies the quintessential small-town vibe: older homes, some updated, others retaining their original charm, with full basements visible from the road. Many homes feature aluminum siding and yards complete with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. The houses reflect a hardworking community, with children and families at the heart. Neighbors are engaged, friendly, and maintain their properties. The area is peaceful, safe, and quiet, with green lawns and well-maintained plants. Nearby are a sheriff's department, health department, city recycling center, sports fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. My kids can bike to the park just a few blocks away. It's an ideal place to raise a family."
