            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city neighborhood is vibrant and diverse, with residential areas interspersed among commercial zones bustling with offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, ranging from large chain stores to trendy boutiques found both in malls and lining the streets.  Parks provide green spaces where families with young children gather.  \n\nThe neighborhood itself is a microcosm of diversity, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a sizable population of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  While these communities are concentrated in my immediate area, the city as a whole is a tapestry of diverse ethnicities, with neighborhoods like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia just a short drive away. However, traffic congestion can make even short distances feel lengthy, turning a 10-mile drive into a two-hour ordeal during rush hour.  \n\nWhile some attractions are within walking distance, the city's vast size discourages walking as a primary mode of transportation. Consequently, the city struggles with some of the world's worst traffic and parking challenges. Ironically, despite these issues, there's been a surge in construction, with numerous apartment buildings being added, drawing both excitement and concern from residents who fear increased population density and traffic. \n\nDespite the prevalence of apartment buildings, the city offers a variety of housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums.  This diversity extends to the age demographics of the residents, with a mix of generations.  While I've grown up in this neighborhood, I'm not particularly close to my neighbors, and the sense of community isn't as strong as in my childhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of a fading American dream. While most houses are single-family homes, some have been divided into smaller units. My own house, with its small yard and driveway, is typical of this era. Although the optimism and pristine upkeep of yesteryear have diminished, the essence of suburban life persists. Cars still fill driveways, children play freely, and a historic public school continues to nurture future generations. \n\nEven though churches are sparsely populated, basketball courts remain bustling hubs of activity. The neighborhood's diverse population, predominantly African American with a notable Yemenite family running the local supermarket, reflects a changing landscape. Wide streets are perfect for children's football games, and a sense of community lingers, with many residents having lived there for generations. \n\nThe neighborhood's evolution is evident in the transformation of a karate school into a pharmacy, reflecting shifting cultural trends. An old movie theater, appreciated by older residents, struggles to attract younger audiences.  The town's identity is further shaped by its limited access to a nearby expressway, highlighting a generational divide between those who want change and those who value its preservation.  A new high school is on the horizon, and the community is debating its mascot, seeking a symbol that captures the unique blend of tradition and progress that defines this place.",
            "Hidden behind a commercial strip, you'd easily overlook this residential area. It might not seem like a desirable place to live, especially with its proximity to an abandoned grocery store and hotels used only for occasional reunions. However, venturing past these unassuming structures reveals a thriving community.\n\nThis community boasts a unique arrangement of apartment complexes, resembling carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls lined up along the road. While some complexes have a controversial past, others offer a hidden world unknown to most residents.  Nearby, a quiet community college campus stands, a beacon of student life amidst the surrounding quiet.  \n\nThe road then intersects with a residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center coexist. The park teems with children playing, while seniors walk their dogs and observe the teenagers skateboarding and socializing. Across the street, a strip mall offers a variety of services, from sushi and frozen yogurt to swimming supplies and nail salons. \n\nThis neighborhood embodies a timeless slice of Southern Americana, a place where change seems to occur at a slower pace.",
            "\"Where are we?\" she asked as we drove past endless fields of corn stretching out before us.  I knew she'd be amazed by the vast openness.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away – she'd never seen so much empty space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe continued down a two-lane road until we reached a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining.  Springtime brings a profusion of flowers alongside the midwestern trees that change color with each season. The driveways are lined with luxury Mercedes-Benz cars that gleam in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, I noticed my Korean neighbor, always outside with a friendly smile.  He spends the entire day mowing his lawn, his singing voice occasionally breaking through the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s a genuinely kind person with a fascinating past.  He was a doctor, but his age has mellowed his wit. Now, he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. Our terrier chases geese in the side yard while a small stream, which feeds into the quarry, flows behind the house. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional cow \"moo\" from nearby farms.  Across a handmade wooden bridge, a wild oasis awaits. It's filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, \"hunting\" animals, and making lifelong friends.\n\nOur winters are incredibly harsh, but there's a beauty in the stark landscape.  The yard transforms from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees, once covered in vibrant flowers, become bare skeletons. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears overnight. My sister and I used to build snowmen and leave snow angels in the backyard. During the winter, snowballs became our weapons of choice, and we'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal\" of branches. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered – just two carefree kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon embraces a unique spirit of \"weirdness,\" a concept deeply ingrained in its culture. While some see it as a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, others perceive it as an invitation to join a community that celebrates the unconventional. Despite the influx of wealthier residents and the rise of modern developments, Portland retains its quirky charm. \"Weirdness\" doesn't imply blind acceptance but rather a willingness to embrace the unusual. \n\nPortland, like any other city, faces challenges like consumerism and social issues. However, its residents approach these issues with a lighter, less serious tone. \n\nOne manifestation of this spirit is the presence of \"free boxes,\" filled with discarded items that may hold unexpected treasures for those who stumble upon them.  \n\nThis sense of wonder and open-mindedness permeates Portland's diverse neighborhoods, where residents engage in a wide range of activities, from goat yoga to attending soccer matches.  \n\nPortland also grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, which are often linked to mental health struggles and exacerbated by the city's climate. While the city strives to provide support, resources remain insufficient.  \n\nUltimately, Portland's \"weirdness\" represents a unique blend of acceptance, individuality, and a willingness to embrace the unexpected.",
            "The mountains, always present to the north, have been a constant companion during my time here. Despite my busy life, they remain a steadfast presence, offering solace and strength when I'm stressed. They first captured my attention when I arrived for university, though the campus itself is full of beauty, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. \n\nThe town is charming, with bustling downtown areas and quaint cafes where I spent countless hours studying. Yet, it's the juxtaposition of these different atmospheres, from the suburban quiet to the urban energy, that makes this place so unique. Each part of town holds its own memories, both joyful and melancholic. \n\nThe ponds, in particular, have been a place of reflection, sometimes for tears shed during moments of existential crisis. Watching the creatures there live their lives made me contemplate my own purpose. One morning, seeking solace, I found myself walking north, drawn to the mountains.

            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, is easily accessible via public transportation, making it a convenient neighborhood to explore. As a predominantly urban area, it retains the quintessential New York City feel.

This has resulted in a vibrant Asian business scene, with supermarkets and laundromats lining the streets, offering high-quality goods at competitive prices. \n\nWhile Bensonhurst boasts a diverse population, including immigrants and their descendants, Asian-owned businesses dominate the commercial landscape. A recently renovated park provides recreational opportunities with basketball courts, fields for sports, handball courts, a playground, and water fountains. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op or condominium apartments. While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood can be quite noisy due to traffic. Visitors should exercise caution at night, as petty crime, such as bullying and package theft, can occur. Additionally, dog waste is a common problem, so be mindful of your footwear.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill with limited sidewalks. The hill, nicknamed \"workout hill,\" is popular with joggers.  Since there are no sidewalks, residents walk on the road, which is in poor condition.  The area is prone to storms, causing frequent power outages and resulting in the electrical wires looking disrepair. Evergreen trees are abundant but disliked by residents who prefer an unobstructed ocean view. Houses are often built high with large windows to maximize the vista. Sunsets are stunning, with the water shimmering and the sky turning orange, though the view is often obscured by clouds.\n\nHumidity is high, leading to moss growth on everything.  The neighborhood has a predominantly older population, with more dogs than children.  \n\nWild rabbits, which gardeners despise, are common, but my cats have kept their numbers down.  Various birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles, are also present.\n\nWhile there are no shops nearby, a few seafood restaurants can be found at the waterfront. The beach is small, but the shoreline rocks are enjoyable to throw into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing for a clear view of the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Although situated on a connecting street between state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, it's generally a quiet area.  The neighborhood has a stable population, allowing me to become acquainted with most residents. Life revolves around daily routines like yard work and chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding on a nearby hill.  Living at the corner, we observe the comings and goings of our neighbors, becoming familiar with their vehicles. Unusual cars attract our attention. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play bikes and engage in typical childhood activities.\n\nAs our family works from home, we spend considerable time indoors. We consist of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen.  Our family's frequent presence is well-known to the neighborhood. We enjoy outdoor playtime, even in the rain, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowing is a common sound from March to October due to the abundant trees in our formerly wooded neighborhood, which also result in seasonal leaf raking and burning.  \n\nThe lack of significant winters lately has extended the feeling of fall. Our garage, located at the rear of the house, leads to infrequent use of the front door unless visitors arrive. Working on my truck or projects in the garage, with the doors open, makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood.  \n\nHolidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with some families hosting out-of-town guests and additional vehicles parked on the streets. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas witness similar patterns. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant, with the exception of the through-traffic.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the heart of the high desert, characterized by its expansive stretches of dry, dusty landscapes. It's a unique environment where verdant lawns are a rarity, and their presence often signifies significant financial investment in maintenance.  \n\nWhile the neighborhood was once more spread out, recent years have witnessed considerable development, blurring the lines between rural and urban living. Despite this transformation, the area retains a friendly atmosphere, with many long-time residents.  \n\nThe local commerce primarily consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with larger, upscale options requiring a journey to other areas. Construction remains a dominant industry, fueled by ongoing development and abundant undeveloped land, a prospect that both excites and unnerves me. I moved here to escape the bustle of cities, and I'm hesitant to see that change. \n\nMy work in the construction industry aligns with this reality; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nLife here is enriched by the diverse wildlife that thrives in this unique ecosystem. From lizards to desert insects, the natural world fascinates my children and me. \n\nVictorville, while not without its charms, offers a different kind of desert experience. Visitors can enjoy the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which showcases local culture and entertainment.  A trip to nearby Wrightwood provides a stark contrast with its snow-capped mountains, ideal for winter sports enthusiasts.  \n\nFor those interested in the region's history and natural heritage, the Victor Valley Museum houses a collection of geological, paleontological, and cultural artifacts that shed light on the development of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood isn't typical. While most people might picture houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is the college campus where I live. My dormitory is my community, and the surrounding campus extends this feeling, though to a lesser extent.  Despite this difference, my campus shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. There are \"houses\" – apartments, individual houses, and dormitory buildings – each offering diverse living arrangements. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging around 20 residents per building. Individual houses, mostly rented by alumni, are less common but provide larger spaces for those who prefer it. The most prevalent housing type is the dormitory, accommodating hundreds of students in shared rooms.\n\nThe campus is incredibly diverse, reflecting the student body's multicultural makeup.  Professional staff often live in the individual houses, while newer students reside in dormitories and older students gravitate towards apartments.  \n\nThe campus is essentially a self-contained community with a variety of stores offering dining options, school-branded merchandise, and groceries.  A single park serves as a common space for everyone to enjoy, kept clean and safe by the community itself.",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for ten years, I can share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was difficult. Leaving my friends and family behind was heartbreaking, but my parents believed this move offered better housing, schools, and opportunities. Over time, I adapted, made new friends and acquaintances, though some less pleasant than others. \n\nWhile I haven't formed close relationships with most neighbors, Mr. Glen and his family, along with Dennis who lived next door, have become like family to me. I cherish the memories we've shared, especially attending Mr. Glen's remarriage. It was a joyful occasion filled with dancing and laughter, and it reminds me of the future I envision for myself and my future wife.  \n\nThe neighborhood itself can be labyrinthine, but with GPS navigation, I'm gradually exploring its nooks and crannies. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, reminiscing about our shared love for video games.  I also find solace in the nearby park, where I practice balance exercises and swordplay, connecting with nature and finding inner peace. \n\nAlthough I haven't actively played basketball or tennis lately, the courts remain a reminder of my past enjoyment of these sports, thanks to my father who instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend under the guidance of Mr. Graves. \n\nFilled with fond memories and looking forward to new adventures, I believe the best is yet to come in this neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college. While mostly composed of apartments, it offers a few affordable restaurants and bars. The area is primarily inhabited by college students and lower-income residents due to the relatively inexpensive housing. The presence of a nearby elementary school contributes to the number of families in the neighborhood. Although I don't know my neighbors well, their frequent marijuana use has led to the building management installing an air freshener unit near their door, a humorous albeit slightly insulting gesture.\n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older, although some may have recently renovated interiors. Newer apartment complexes down the street, while aesthetically appealing, are built cheaply and charge exorbitant rents, taking advantage of their proximity to the university.\n\nThere's a budget-friendly restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly prepared in a microwave, and a gas station known for its unfavorable working conditions. Despite these quirks, the neighborhood has undergone improvements thanks to city funding, including a newly paved road, wider sidewalks, and landscaping.\n\nMy apartment building is nestled amidst trees, although some have been removed. Behind my complex lies a tree line and another set of apartments on a less desirable street with dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. This street also experiences a higher rate of crime, concentrated in a particular apartment complex.\n\nDespite these challenges, I find my neighborhood livable and affordable, appreciating its proximity to the university and the convenience of nearby amenities like bus stops and the store.",
            "My neighborhood consists of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses.  They all share a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs.  While not everyone knows each other, there's a strong sense of community, with neighbors often gathering in the evenings to chat while their children play. This idyllic atmosphere feels like a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields, trees, and clear blue skies, offering a picturesque setting. However, this peaceful existence was recently disrupted by a severe thunderstorm, complete with tornado warnings and sirens. I sought shelter in my bathtub with my small dog, while my larger dog nervously paced in the living room. The storm raged with heavy hail that pounded the ground, causing the road to steam from the sudden temperature drop.\n\nAs the storm cleared, a stunning double rainbow appeared, prompting me to grab my camera and capture the breathtaking sight. After an hour of quiet, neighbors slowly returned home, and life resumed its usual pace.\n\nDespite the uniformity of the exterior design, each duplex has its own unique interior. While I live in a comfortably sized two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, some units are surprisingly small.  \n\nI enjoy exploring the large field behind my house, leading to a picturesque pond where I've spotted deer and heard the croaking of bullfrogs.  The neighborhood is truly a gem, located just forty minutes from Charlotte, with the added charm of nearby farms, including one with a friendly donkey whose braying echoes through the evening air. I feel fortunate to have found this welcoming community.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood at the beginning of eighth grade. Adjusting and making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually formed close bonds with two neighbors who unfortunately no longer live here.  Despite this, the core community remains largely unchanged.  My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by two-story houses and a strong sense of community. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sounds of children playing, while the rest of the week is generally quiet. I've always felt safe and respected by my neighbors, with very few issues encountered over the years.  \n\nA nearby park holds many memories for me, from sports games with neighborhood friends to a particularly painful elbow injury I sustained during a football match. Despite the occasional mishap, the good memories outweigh the bad. Now, I frequent the park to spend time with my younger cousins, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.\n\nThe neighborhood boasts a diverse culinary scene, offering a range of cuisines within a short distance, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. While delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, the neighborhood also features numerous fast food chains and pizza places. Essential stores are plentiful, with dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a large grocery store, Jewel-Osco.  Even local businesses contribute to the diversity, such as an Indian-owned store catering to those who enjoy home-cooked or ready-made Indian meals.\n\nOverall, I am grateful for my neighborhood.  Hearing about the challenges faced by others in their communities makes me appreciate the strong sense of safety and support I experience here.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, Johnston is a small town known as the \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  Agriculture is its lifeblood, with vast fields of peach trees and cattle grazing lands dominating the landscape.  The town's scattered houses, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, stand apart from each other, often set back from the roads to accommodate agricultural activities.\n\nThe town center, marked by a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, houses its limited retail options.  Fast food choices include Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain.  A pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store, caters to residents, though many travel to larger stores in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs.  Dollar General, a popular destination for everyday items, enjoys brisk business throughout the day.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing local furniture store, and its attached pet grooming business, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offer essential services.  A doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both small but well-equipped, serve the town's residents.  Johnston Elementary School provides education through fifth grade, with students continuing their studies in the neighboring town.\n\nWhile lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance amenities and attract new residents.  Life in Johnston is quiet, with limited entertainment options.   Despite its simplicity, it remains a charming and close-knit community.",
            "I first learned about my apartment building from a podcast about missing persons, which was surprising because it was in a relatively pricey area.  It seemed like no one else had heard the story, not even my friends. I understand the struggle of making ends meet; some of my friends experience financial stress and worry.  While things are expensive, we've learned to be resourceful, finding joy in bargain finds at flea markets and thrift stores.  The smell of adulthood, I've come to realize, is that of dusty flea market treasures and moth-eaten clothing.\n\nFortunately, my neighborhood is filled with thrift stores, libraries, and unique shops. Downtown is bustling with activity, but the quiet of these stores provides a welcome escape.\n\nThis city is rapidly developing, attracting major companies and a growing population, reminiscent of New York City. People here are focused on their individual goals and tend to keep to themselves.  There's a sense of independence and privacy, a stark contrast to the more communal atmosphere of the South.\n\nDespite the city's size and anonymity, I've found a sense of community among my neighbors. We support each other through life's milestones and challenges, creating a network of friendship.\n\nLiving in this massive, impersonal building, it's the connections I've made with my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban development with a strong homeowner's association.  The well-maintained, uniform single-family homes  feature similar front yards with landscaping, decorative stones, and short driveways.  Paved roads are in excellent condition throughout the neighborhood. While most homes are single-story, some are two stories. Instead of individual mailboxes, residents share a communal mailbox system with key access and package lockers.  Located on the outskirts of a relatively large city, the neighborhood has a mix of suburban and rural characteristics.  Residents enjoy access to community pools, gated walking trails, and ample open space. The community is predominantly composed of retirees, with a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals.  While the city itself is sizable, it retains a small-town atmosphere. Residents have access to essential amenities, including a mall, a variety of grocery stores, and chain retailers, all within a short drive.  Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a comfortable suburban lifestyle with convenient access to both urban and recreational amenities.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. While my east-side neighborhood experiences economic hardship with lower property values and predominantly low-income residents, it's not undesirable. My neighbors are friendly, and despite slightly higher crime rates than other areas, it remains relatively safe. Although there have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, our family hasn't been directly affected beyond occasional petty theft. \n\nThe opioid epidemic has significantly impacted our town, leading to numerous fentanyl-related deaths. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available to combat this crisis.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has much to offer. My son thrives in his elementary school, which boasts excellent staff and a supportive environment. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry, and proactively addresses the needs of its diverse student body.\n\nWhile the town council has made beautification efforts, these primarily benefit the central business district and west side, leaving the east side comparatively neglected.  \n\nOverall, I find joy in living here. The friendly community, exceptional schools, diverse shopping options, and our comfortable home contribute to a sense of belonging. Having lived here for over 16 years, we feel deeply rooted in this town.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and history. Situated on a hill, it boasts beautiful old buildings, including an old theater across from my apartment building. A nearby arcade bar attracts diverse crowds on warm evenings, often leading to lines during summer weekends. The neighborhood also features a large city park, surrounded by concrete walls and steps. During winter, homeless individuals often find shelter in organized rows along the sidewalk and steps, seeking warmth and proximity to the nearby family center offering essential services. While the neighborhood's history and architecture are noteworthy, what truly captivates me is the resilience and spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, carries the weight of its past. Stories of government crackdowns on crime persist, serving as reminders of the neighborhood's challenging history. Despite these hardships, the residents have worked diligently to uplift their community, taking pride in its cleanliness and safety. Despite warnings to avoid the area after dark for those who are not part of the community, I believe this reflects outdated prejudices and fear-based assumptions. I feel a sense of belonging in Hilltop, experiencing kindness and support from its residents. From offering a jacket in the cold to extending closing hours for my convenience, the people of Hilltop have shown me genuine compassion. On those bleak nights, when I felt invisible, they have surprised me with unexpected acts of kindness, reminding me of my inherent worth. Despite any challenges, Hilltop will always be my home, a place where I feel alive and connected to a community that embraces and uplifts its members.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural Michigan, transitioning from farmland to quaint tourist destinations.  There are no large shopping malls or chain stores like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's; everything requires a drive. Despite this, I live in a stunning location surrounded by lakes. My town is bordered by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering beaches within easy reach. My neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses are not crammed together and lack uniformity, showcasing older, diverse styles, some renovated and some retaining their original charm. Many have full basements visible from the street, and older aluminum siding is common. The neighborhood boasts a colorful array of houses, each with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets.\n\nThe residents are hardworking individuals, primarily focused on raising families or enjoying their later years. Children frequently play in the streets, while adults engage in activities like walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading.  A strong sense of community prevails, with neighbors recognizing and welcoming each other.  \n\nLawns are well-maintained, free of debris, with trimmed grass and bushes. While not outwardly extravagant, the neighborhood exudes a welcoming and safe atmosphere, ideal for raising a family. It's a place where people feel a sense of belonging and security. Conveniently located nearby are the county sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, providing essential services to residents.\n\nThe area also features baseball and softball fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop, all within walking distance. My children can easily bike to the park, which is just eight blocks away.  Overall, it's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city neighborhood is vibrant and diverse, with residential areas interspersed among commercial zones bustling with offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, ranging from large chain stores to trendy boutiques found both in malls and lining the streets.  Parks provide green spaces where families with young children gather.  \n\nThe neighborhood itself is a microcosm of diversity, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a sizable population of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  While these communities are concentrated in my immediate area, the city as a whole is a tapestry of diverse ethnicities, with neighborhoods like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia just a short drive away. However, traffic congestion can make even short distances feel lengthy, turning a 10-mile drive into a two-hour ordeal during rush hour.  \n\nWhile some attractions are within walking distance, the city's vast size discourages walking as a primary mode of transportation. Consequently, the city struggles with some of the world's worst traffic and parking challenges. Ironically, despite these issues, there's been a surge in construction, with numerous apartment buildings being added, drawing both excitement and concern from residents who fear increased population density and traffic. \n\nDespite the prevalence of apartment buildings, the city offers a variety of housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums.  This diversity extends to the age demographics of the residents, with a mix of generations.  While I've grown up in this neighborhood, I'm not particularly close to my neighbors, and the sense of community isn't as strong as in my childhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of a fading American dream. While most houses are single-family homes, some have been divided into smaller units. My own house, with its small yard and driveway, is typical of this era. Although the optimism and pristine upkeep of yesteryear have diminished, the essence of suburban life persists. Cars still fill driveways, children play freely, and a historic public school continues to nurture future generations. \n\nEven though churches are sparsely populated, basketball courts remain bustling hubs of activity. The neighborhood's diverse population, predominantly African American with a notable Yemenite family running the local supermarket, reflects a changing landscape. Wide streets are perfect for children's football games, and a sense of community lingers, with many residents having lived there for generations. \n\nThe neighborhood's evolution is evident in the transformation of a karate school into a pharmacy, reflecting shifting cultural trends. An old movie theater, appreciated by older residents, struggles to attract younger audiences.  The town's identity is further shaped by its limited access to a nearby expressway, highlighting a generational divide between those who want change and those who value its preservation.  A new high school is on the horizon, and the community is debating its mascot, seeking a symbol that captures the unique blend of tradition and progress that defines this place.",
            "Hidden behind a commercial strip, you'd easily overlook this residential area. It might not seem like a desirable place to live, especially with its proximity to an abandoned grocery store and hotels used only for occasional reunions. However, venturing past these unassuming structures reveals a thriving community.\n\nThis community boasts a unique arrangement of apartment complexes, resembling carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls lined up along the road. While some complexes have a controversial past, others offer a hidden world unknown to most residents.  Nearby, a quiet community college campus stands, a beacon of student life amidst the surrounding quiet.  \n\nThe road then intersects with a residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center coexist. The park teems with children playing, while seniors walk their dogs and observe the teenagers skateboarding and socializing. Across the street, a strip mall offers a variety of services, from sushi and frozen yogurt to swimming supplies and nail salons. \n\nThis neighborhood embodies a timeless slice of Southern Americana, a place where change seems to occur at a slower pace.",
            "\"Where are we?\" she asked as we drove past endless fields of corn stretching out before us.  I knew she'd be amazed by the vast openness.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away – she'd never seen so much empty space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe continued down a two-lane road until we reached a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining.  Springtime brings a profusion of flowers alongside the midwestern trees that change color with each season. The driveways are lined with luxury Mercedes-Benz cars that gleam in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, I noticed my Korean neighbor, always outside with a friendly smile.  He spends the entire day mowing his lawn, his singing voice occasionally breaking through the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s a genuinely kind person with a fascinating past.  He was a doctor, but his age has mellowed his wit. Now, he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. Our terrier chases geese in the side yard while a small stream, which feeds into the quarry, flows behind the house. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional cow \"moo\" from nearby farms.  Across a handmade wooden bridge, a wild oasis awaits. It's filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, \"hunting\" animals, and making lifelong friends.\n\nOur winters are incredibly harsh, but there's a beauty in the stark landscape.  The yard transforms from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees, once covered in vibrant flowers, become bare skeletons. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears overnight. My sister and I used to build snowmen and leave snow angels in the backyard. During the winter, snowballs became our weapons of choice, and we'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal\" of branches. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered – just two carefree kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon embraces a unique spirit of \"weirdness,\" a concept deeply ingrained in its culture. While some see it as a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, others perceive it as an invitation to join a community that celebrates the unconventional. Despite the influx of wealthier residents and the rise of modern developments, Portland retains its quirky charm. \"Weirdness\" doesn't imply blind acceptance but rather a willingness to embrace the unusual. \n\nPortland, like any other city, faces challenges like consumerism and social issues. However, its residents approach these issues with a lighter, less serious tone. \n\nOne manifestation of this spirit is the presence of \"free boxes,\" filled with discarded items that may hold unexpected treasures for those who stumble upon them.  \n\nThis sense of wonder and open-mindedness permeates Portland's diverse neighborhoods, where residents engage in a wide range of activities, from goat yoga to attending soccer matches.  \n\nPortland also grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, which are often linked to mental health struggles and exacerbated by the city's climate. While the city strives to provide support, resources remain insufficient.  \n\nUltimately, Portland's \"weirdness\" represents a unique blend of acceptance, individuality, and a willingness to embrace the unexpected.",
            "The mountains, always present to the north, have been a constant companion during my time here. Despite my busy life, they remain a steadfast presence, offering solace and strength when I'm stressed. They first captured my attention when I arrived for university, though the campus itself is full of beauty, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. \n\nThe town is charming, with bustling downtown areas and quaint cafes where I spent countless hours studying. Yet, it's the juxtaposition of these different atmospheres, from the suburban quiet to the urban energy, that makes this place so unique. Each part of town holds its own memories, both joyful and melancholic. \n\nThe ponds, in particular, have been a place of reflection, sometimes for tears shed during moments of existential crisis. Watching the creatures there live their lives made me contemplate my own purpose. One morning, seeking solace, I found myself walking north, drawn to the mountains. As the sun rose, bathing the mountains in its light, I felt a renewed sense of perseverance, reminded of their enduring strength.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, is easily accessible via public transportation, making it a convenient neighborhood to explore. As a predominantly urban area, it retains the quintessential New York City feel.

This has resulted in a vibrant Asian business scene, with supermarkets and laundromats lining the streets, offering high-quality goods at competitive prices. \n\nWhile Bensonhurst boasts a diverse population, including immigrants and their descendants, Asian-owned businesses dominate the commercial landscape. A recently renovated park provides recreational opportunities with basketball courts, fields for sports, handball courts, a playground, and water fountains. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op or condominium apartments. While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood can be quite noisy due to traffic. Visitors should exercise caution at night, as petty crime, such as bullying and package theft, can occur. Additionally, dog waste is a common problem, so be mindful of your footwear.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill with limited sidewalks. The hill, nicknamed \"workout hill,\" is popular with joggers.  Since there are no sidewalks, residents walk on the road, which is in poor condition.  The area is prone to storms, causing frequent power outages and resulting in the electrical wires looking disrepair. Evergreen trees are abundant but disliked by residents who prefer an unobstructed ocean view. Houses are often built high with large windows to maximize the vista. Sunsets are stunning, with the water shimmering and the sky turning orange, though the view is often obscured by clouds.\n\nHumidity is high, leading to moss growth on everything.  The neighborhood has a predominantly older population, with more dogs than children.  \n\nWild rabbits, which gardeners despise, are common, but my cats have kept their numbers down.  Various birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles, are also present.\n\nWhile there are no shops nearby, a few seafood restaurants can be found at the waterfront. The beach is small, but the shoreline rocks are enjoyable to throw into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing for a clear view of the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Although situated on a connecting street between state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, it's generally a quiet area.  The neighborhood has a stable population, allowing me to become acquainted with most residents. Life revolves around daily routines like yard work and chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding on a nearby hill.  Living at the corner, we observe the comings and goings of our neighbors, becoming familiar with their vehicles. Unusual cars attract our attention. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play bikes and engage in typical childhood activities.\n\nAs our family works from home, we spend considerable time indoors. We consist of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen.  Our family's frequent presence is well-known to the neighborhood. We enjoy outdoor playtime, even in the rain, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowing is a common sound from March to October due to the abundant trees in our formerly wooded neighborhood, which also result in seasonal leaf raking and burning.  \n\nThe lack of significant winters lately has extended the feeling of fall. Our garage, located at the rear of the house, leads to infrequent use of the front door unless visitors arrive. Working on my truck or projects in the garage, with the doors open, makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood.  \n\nHolidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with some families hosting out-of-town guests and additional vehicles parked on the streets. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas witness similar patterns. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant, with the exception of the through-traffic.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the heart of the high desert, characterized by its expansive stretches of dry, dusty landscapes. It's a unique environment where verdant lawns are a rarity, and their presence often signifies significant financial investment in maintenance.  \n\nWhile the neighborhood was once more spread out, recent years have witnessed considerable development, blurring the lines between rural and urban living. Despite this transformation, the area retains a friendly atmosphere, with many long-time residents.  \n\nThe local commerce primarily consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with larger, upscale options requiring a journey to other areas. Construction remains a dominant industry, fueled by ongoing development and abundant undeveloped land, a prospect that both excites and unnerves me. I moved here to escape the bustle of cities, and I'm hesitant to see that change. \n\nMy work in the construction industry aligns with this reality; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nLife here is enriched by the diverse wildlife that thrives in this unique ecosystem. From lizards to desert insects, the natural world fascinates my children and me. \n\nVictorville, while not without its charms, offers a different kind of desert experience. Visitors can enjoy the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which showcases local culture and entertainment.  A trip to nearby Wrightwood provides a stark contrast with its snow-capped mountains, ideal for winter sports enthusiasts.  \n\nFor those interested in the region's history and natural heritage, the Victor Valley Museum houses a collection of geological, paleontological, and cultural artifacts that shed light on the development of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood isn't typical. While most people might picture houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is the college campus where I live. My dormitory is my community, and the surrounding campus extends this feeling, though to a lesser extent.  Despite this difference, my campus shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. There are \"houses\" – apartments, individual houses, and dormitory buildings – each offering diverse living arrangements. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging around 20 residents per building. Individual houses, mostly rented by alumni, are less common but provide larger spaces for those who prefer it. The most prevalent housing type is the dormitory, accommodating hundreds of students in shared rooms.\n\nThe campus is incredibly diverse, reflecting the student body's multicultural makeup.  Professional staff often live in the individual houses, while newer students reside in dormitories and older students gravitate towards apartments.  \n\nThe campus is essentially a self-contained community with a variety of stores offering dining options, school-branded merchandise, and groceries.  A single park serves as a common space for everyone to enjoy, kept clean and safe by the community itself.",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for ten years, I can share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was difficult. Leaving my friends and family behind was heartbreaking, but my parents believed this move offered better housing, schools, and opportunities. Over time, I adapted, made new friends and acquaintances, though some less pleasant than others. \n\nWhile I haven't formed close relationships with most neighbors, Mr. Glen and his family, along with Dennis who lived next door, have become like family to me. I cherish the memories we've shared, especially attending Mr. Glen's remarriage. It was a joyful occasion filled with dancing and laughter, and it reminds me of the future I envision for myself and my future wife.  \n\nThe neighborhood itself can be labyrinthine, but with GPS navigation, I'm gradually exploring its nooks and crannies. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, reminiscing about our shared love for video games.  I also find solace in the nearby park, where I practice balance exercises and swordplay, connecting with nature and finding inner peace. \n\nAlthough I haven't actively played basketball or tennis lately, the courts remain a reminder of my past enjoyment of these sports, thanks to my father who instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend under the guidance of Mr. Graves. \n\nFilled with fond memories and looking forward to new adventures, I believe the best is yet to come in this neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college. While mostly composed of apartments, it offers a few affordable restaurants and bars. The area is primarily inhabited by college students and lower-income residents due to the relatively inexpensive housing. The presence of a nearby elementary school contributes to the number of families in the neighborhood. Although I don't know my neighbors well, their frequent marijuana use has led to the building management installing an air freshener unit near their door, a humorous albeit slightly insulting gesture.\n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older, although some may have recently renovated interiors. Newer apartment complexes down the street, while aesthetically appealing, are built cheaply and charge exorbitant rents, taking advantage of their proximity to the university.\n\nThere's a budget-friendly restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly prepared in a microwave, and a gas station known for its unfavorable working conditions. Despite these quirks, the neighborhood has undergone improvements thanks to city funding, including a newly paved road, wider sidewalks, and landscaping.\n\nMy apartment building is nestled amidst trees, although some have been removed. Behind my complex lies a tree line and another set of apartments on a less desirable street with dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. This street also experiences a higher rate of crime, concentrated in a particular apartment complex.\n\nDespite these challenges, I find my neighborhood livable and affordable, appreciating its proximity to the university and the convenience of nearby amenities like bus stops and the store.",
            "My neighborhood consists of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses.  They all share a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs.  While not everyone knows each other, there's a strong sense of community, with neighbors often gathering in the evenings to chat while their children play. This idyllic atmosphere feels like a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields, trees, and clear blue skies, offering a picturesque setting. However, this peaceful existence was recently disrupted by a severe thunderstorm, complete with tornado warnings and sirens. I sought shelter in my bathtub with my small dog, while my larger dog nervously paced in the living room. The storm raged with heavy hail that pounded the ground, causing the road to steam from the sudden temperature drop.\n\nAs the storm cleared, a stunning double rainbow appeared, prompting me to grab my camera and capture the breathtaking sight. After an hour of quiet, neighbors slowly returned home, and life resumed its usual pace.\n\nDespite the uniformity of the exterior design, each duplex has its own unique interior. While I live in a comfortably sized two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, some units are surprisingly small.  \n\nI enjoy exploring the large field behind my house, leading to a picturesque pond where I've spotted deer and heard the croaking of bullfrogs.  The neighborhood is truly a gem, located just forty minutes from Charlotte, with the added charm of nearby farms, including one with a friendly donkey whose braying echoes through the evening air. I feel fortunate to have found this welcoming community.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood at the beginning of eighth grade. Adjusting and making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually formed close bonds with two neighbors who unfortunately no longer live here.  Despite this, the core community remains largely unchanged.  My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by two-story houses and a strong sense of community. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sounds of children playing, while the rest of the week is generally quiet. I've always felt safe and respected by my neighbors, with very few issues encountered over the years.  \n\nA nearby park holds many memories for me, from sports games with neighborhood friends to a particularly painful elbow injury I sustained during a football match. Despite the occasional mishap, the good memories outweigh the bad. Now, I frequent the park to spend time with my younger cousins, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.\n\nThe neighborhood boasts a diverse culinary scene, offering a range of cuisines within a short distance, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. While delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, the neighborhood also features numerous fast food chains and pizza places. Essential stores are plentiful, with dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a large grocery store, Jewel-Osco.  Even local businesses contribute to the diversity, such as an Indian-owned store catering to those who enjoy home-cooked or ready-made Indian meals.\n\nOverall, I am grateful for my neighborhood.  Hearing about the challenges faced by others in their communities makes me appreciate the strong sense of safety and support I experience here.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, Johnston is a small town known as the \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  Agriculture is its lifeblood, with vast fields of peach trees and cattle grazing lands dominating the landscape.  The town's scattered houses, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, stand apart from each other, often set back from the roads to accommodate agricultural activities.\n\nThe town center, marked by a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, houses its limited retail options.  Fast food choices include Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain.  A pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store, caters to residents, though many travel to larger stores in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs.  Dollar General, a popular destination for everyday items, enjoys brisk business throughout the day.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing local furniture store, and its attached pet grooming business, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offer essential services.  A doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both small but well-equipped, serve the town's residents.  Johnston Elementary School provides education through fifth grade, with students continuing their studies in the neighboring town.\n\nWhile lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance amenities and attract new residents.  Life in Johnston is quiet, with limited entertainment options.   Despite its simplicity, it remains a charming and close-knit community.",
            "I first learned about my apartment building from a podcast about missing persons, which was surprising because it was in a relatively pricey area.  It seemed like no one else had heard the story, not even my friends. I understand the struggle of making ends meet; some of my friends experience financial stress and worry.  While things are expensive, we've learned to be resourceful, finding joy in bargain finds at flea markets and thrift stores.  The smell of adulthood, I've come to realize, is that of dusty flea market treasures and moth-eaten clothing.\n\nFortunately, my neighborhood is filled with thrift stores, libraries, and unique shops. Downtown is bustling with activity, but the quiet of these stores provides a welcome escape.\n\nThis city is rapidly developing, attracting major companies and a growing population, reminiscent of New York City. People here are focused on their individual goals and tend to keep to themselves.  There's a sense of independence and privacy, a stark contrast to the more communal atmosphere of the South.\n\nDespite the city's size and anonymity, I've found a sense of community among my neighbors. We support each other through life's milestones and challenges, creating a network of friendship.\n\nLiving in this massive, impersonal building, it's the connections I've made with my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban development with a strong homeowner's association.  The well-maintained, uniform single-family homes  feature similar front yards with landscaping, decorative stones, and short driveways.  Paved roads are in excellent condition throughout the neighborhood. While most homes are single-story, some are two stories. Instead of individual mailboxes, residents share a communal mailbox system with key access and package lockers.  Located on the outskirts of a relatively large city, the neighborhood has a mix of suburban and rural characteristics.  Residents enjoy access to community pools, gated walking trails, and ample open space. The community is predominantly composed of retirees, with a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals.  While the city itself is sizable, it retains a small-town atmosphere. Residents have access to essential amenities, including a mall, a variety of grocery stores, and chain retailers, all within a short drive.  Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a comfortable suburban lifestyle with convenient access to both urban and recreational amenities.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. While my east-side neighborhood experiences economic hardship with lower property values and predominantly low-income residents, it's not undesirable. My neighbors are friendly, and despite slightly higher crime rates than other areas, it remains relatively safe. Although there have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, our family hasn't been directly affected beyond occasional petty theft. \n\nThe opioid epidemic has significantly impacted our town, leading to numerous fentanyl-related deaths. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available to combat this crisis.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has much to offer. My son thrives in his elementary school, which boasts excellent staff and a supportive environment. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry, and proactively addresses the needs of its diverse student body.\n\nWhile the town council has made beautification efforts, these primarily benefit the central business district and west side, leaving the east side comparatively neglected.  \n\nOverall, I find joy in living here. The friendly community, exceptional schools, diverse shopping options, and our comfortable home contribute to a sense of belonging. Having lived here for over 16 years, we feel deeply rooted in this town.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and history. Situated on a hill, it boasts beautiful old buildings, including an old theater across from my apartment building. A nearby arcade bar attracts diverse crowds on warm evenings, often leading to lines during summer weekends. The neighborhood also features a large city park, surrounded by concrete walls and steps. During winter, homeless individuals often find shelter in organized rows along the sidewalk and steps, seeking warmth and proximity to the nearby family center offering essential services. While the neighborhood's history and architecture are noteworthy, what truly captivates me is the resilience and spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, carries the weight of its past. Stories of government crackdowns on crime persist, serving as reminders of the neighborhood's challenging history. Despite these hardships, the residents have worked diligently to uplift their community, taking pride in its cleanliness and safety. Despite warnings to avoid the area after dark for those who are not part of the community, I believe this reflects outdated prejudices and fear-based assumptions. I feel a sense of belonging in Hilltop, experiencing kindness and support from its residents. From offering a jacket in the cold to extending closing hours for my convenience, the people of Hilltop have shown me genuine compassion. On those bleak nights, when I felt invisible, they have surprised me with unexpected acts of kindness, reminding me of my inherent worth. Despite any challenges, Hilltop will always be my home, a place where I feel alive and connected to a community that embraces and uplifts its members.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural Michigan, transitioning from farmland to quaint tourist destinations.  There are no large shopping malls or chain stores like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's; everything requires a drive. Despite this, I live in a stunning location surrounded by lakes. My town is bordered by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering beaches within easy reach. My neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses are not crammed together and lack uniformity, showcasing older, diverse styles, some renovated and some retaining their original charm. Many have full basements visible from the street, and older aluminum siding is common. The neighborhood boasts a colorful array of houses, each with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets.\n\nThe residents are hardworking individuals, primarily focused on raising families or enjoying their later years. Children frequently play in the streets, while adults engage in activities like walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading.  A strong sense of community prevails, with neighbors recognizing and welcoming each other.  \n\nLawns are well-maintained, free of debris, with trimmed grass and bushes. While not outwardly extravagant, the neighborhood exudes a welcoming and safe atmosphere, ideal for raising a family. It's a place where people feel a sense of belonging and security. Conveniently located nearby are the county sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, providing essential services to residents.\n\nThe area also features baseball and softball fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop, all within walking distance. My children can easily bike to the park, which is just eight blocks away.  Overall, it's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city neighborhood is vibrant and diverse, with residential areas interspersed among commercial zones bustling with offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  There's an abundance of dining and shopping options, ranging from large chain stores to trendy boutiques found both in malls and lining the streets.  Parks provide green spaces where families with young children gather.  \n\nThe neighborhood itself is a microcosm of diversity, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a sizable population of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  While these communities are concentrated in my immediate area, the city as a whole is a tapestry of diverse ethnicities, with neighborhoods like Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Armenia just a short drive away. However, traffic congestion can make even short distances feel lengthy, turning a 10-mile drive into a two-hour ordeal during rush hour.  \n\nWhile some attractions are within walking distance, the city's vast size discourages walking as a primary mode of transportation. Consequently, the city struggles with some of the world's worst traffic and parking challenges. Ironically, despite these issues, there's been a surge in construction, with numerous apartment buildings being added, drawing both excitement and concern from residents who fear increased population density and traffic. \n\nDespite the prevalence of apartment buildings, the city offers a variety of housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums.  This diversity extends to the age demographics of the residents, with a mix of generations.  While I've grown up in this neighborhood, I'm not particularly close to my neighbors, and the sense of community isn't as strong as in my childhood.",
            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of a fading American dream. While most houses are single-family homes, some have been divided into smaller units. My own house, with its small yard and driveway, is typical of this era. Although the optimism and pristine upkeep of yesteryear have diminished, the essence of suburban life persists. Cars still fill driveways, children play freely, and a historic public school continues to nurture future generations. \n\nEven though churches are sparsely populated, basketball courts remain bustling hubs of activity. The neighborhood's diverse population, predominantly African American with a notable Yemenite family running the local supermarket, reflects a changing landscape. Wide streets are perfect for children's football games, and a sense of community lingers, with many residents having lived there for generations. \n\nThe neighborhood's evolution is evident in the transformation of a karate school into a pharmacy, reflecting shifting cultural trends. An old movie theater, appreciated by older residents, struggles to attract younger audiences.  The town's identity is further shaped by its limited access to a nearby expressway, highlighting a generational divide between those who want change and those who value its preservation.  A new high school is on the horizon, and the community is debating its mascot, seeking a symbol that captures the unique blend of tradition and progress that defines this place.",
            "Hidden behind a commercial strip, you'd easily overlook this residential area. It might not seem like a desirable place to live, especially with its proximity to an abandoned grocery store and hotels used only for occasional reunions. However, venturing past these unassuming structures reveals a thriving community.\n\nThis community boasts a unique arrangement of apartment complexes, resembling carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls lined up along the road. While some complexes have a controversial past, others offer a hidden world unknown to most residents.  Nearby, a quiet community college campus stands, a beacon of student life amidst the surrounding quiet.  \n\nThe road then intersects with a residential street, where a park and a rehabilitation center coexist. The park teems with children playing, while seniors walk their dogs and observe the teenagers skateboarding and socializing. Across the street, a strip mall offers a variety of services, from sushi and frozen yogurt to swimming supplies and nail salons. \n\nThis neighborhood embodies a timeless slice of Southern Americana, a place where change seems to occur at a slower pace.",
            "\"Where are we?\" she asked as we drove past endless fields of corn stretching out before us.  I knew she'd be amazed by the vast openness.  She came from a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away – she'd never seen so much empty space. I told her about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe continued down a two-lane road until we reached a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining.  Springtime brings a profusion of flowers alongside the midwestern trees that change color with each season. The driveways are lined with luxury Mercedes-Benz cars that gleam in the midday sun after a good wash.\n\nAs we drove towards my grey stucco house, I noticed my Korean neighbor, always outside with a friendly smile.  He spends the entire day mowing his lawn, his singing voice occasionally breaking through the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, but he’s a genuinely kind person with a fascinating past.  He was a doctor, but his age has mellowed his wit. Now, he blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. Our terrier chases geese in the side yard while a small stream, which feeds into the quarry, flows behind the house. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional cow \"moo\" from nearby farms.  Across a handmade wooden bridge, a wild oasis awaits. It's filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, \"hunting\" animals, and making lifelong friends.\n\nOur winters are incredibly harsh, but there's a beauty in the stark landscape.  The yard transforms from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees, once covered in vibrant flowers, become bare skeletons. When it snows, a winter wonderland appears overnight. My sister and I used to build snowmen and leave snow angels in the backyard. During the winter, snowballs became our weapons of choice, and we'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal\" of branches. In our own winter wonderland, we played pretend, lost in a world where nothing else mattered – just two carefree kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon embraces a unique spirit of \"weirdness,\" a concept deeply ingrained in its culture. While some see it as a nostalgic reminder of the city's past, a time when it was less known and more affordable, others perceive it as an invitation to join a community that celebrates the unconventional. Despite the influx of wealthier residents and the rise of modern developments, Portland retains its quirky charm. \"Weirdness\" doesn't imply blind acceptance but rather a willingness to embrace the unusual. \n\nPortland, like any other city, faces challenges like consumerism and social issues. However, its residents approach these issues with a lighter, less serious tone. \n\nOne manifestation of this spirit is the presence of \"free boxes,\" filled with discarded items that may hold unexpected treasures for those who stumble upon them.  \n\nThis sense of wonder and open-mindedness permeates Portland's diverse neighborhoods, where residents engage in a wide range of activities, from goat yoga to attending soccer matches.  \n\nPortland also grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, which are often linked to mental health struggles and exacerbated by the city's climate. While the city strives to provide support, resources remain insufficient.  \n\nUltimately, Portland's \"weirdness\" represents a unique blend of acceptance, individuality, and a willingness to embrace the unexpected.",
            "The mountains, always present to the north, have been a constant companion during my time here. Despite my busy life, they remain a steadfast presence, offering solace and strength when I'm stressed. They first captured my attention when I arrived for university, though the campus itself is full of beauty, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. \n\nThe town is charming, with bustling downtown areas and quaint cafes where I spent countless hours studying. Yet, it's the juxtaposition of these different atmospheres, from the suburban quiet to the urban energy, that makes this place so unique. Each part of town holds its own memories, both joyful and melancholic. \n\nThe ponds, in particular, have been a place of reflection, sometimes for tears shed during moments of existential crisis. Watching the creatures there live their lives made me contemplate my own purpose. One morning, seeking solace, I found myself walking north, drawn to the mountains. As the sun rose, bathing the mountains in its light, I felt a renewed sense of perseverance, reminded of their enduring strength.",

This has resulted in a vibrant Asian business scene, with supermarkets and laundromats lining the streets, offering high-quality goods at competitive prices. \n\nWhile Bensonhurst boasts a diverse population, including immigrants and their descendants, Asian-owned businesses dominate the commercial landscape. A recently renovated park provides recreational opportunities with basketball courts, fields for sports, handball courts, a playground, and water fountains. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op or condominium apartments. While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood can be quite noisy due to traffic. Visitors should exercise caution at night, as petty crime, such as bullying and package theft, can occur. Additionally, dog waste is a common problem, so be mindful of your footwear.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill with limited sidewalks. The hill, nicknamed \"workout hill,\" is popular with joggers.  Since there are no sidewalks, residents walk on the road, which is in poor condition.  The area is prone to storms, causing frequent power outages and resulting in the electrical wires looking disrepair. Evergreen trees are abundant but disliked by residents who prefer an unobstructed ocean view. Houses are often built high with large windows to maximize the vista. Sunsets are stunning, with the water shimmering and the sky turning orange, though the view is often obscured by clouds.\n\nHumidity is high, leading to moss growth on everything.  The neighborhood has a predominantly older population, with more dogs than children.  \n\nWild rabbits, which gardeners despise, are common, but my cats have kept their numbers down.  Various birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles, are also present.\n\nWhile there are no shops nearby, a few seafood restaurants can be found at the waterfront.

            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Although situated on a connecting street between state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, it's generally a quiet area.  The neighborhood has a stable population, allowing me to become acquainted with most residents. Life revolves around daily routines like yard work and chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding on a nearby hill.  Living at the corner, we observe the comings and goings of our neighbors, becoming familiar with their vehicles. Unusual cars attract our attention. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play bikes and engage in typical childhood activities.\n\nAs our family works from home, we spend considerable time indoors. We consist of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen.  Our family's frequent presence is well-known to the neighborhood. We enjoy outdoor playtime, even in the rain, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. Lawn mowing is a common sound from March to October due to the abundant trees in our formerly wooded neighborhood, which also result in seasonal leaf raking and burning.  \n\nThe lack of significant winters lately has extended the feeling of fall. Our garage, located at the rear of the house, leads to infrequent use of the front door unless visitors arrive. Working on my truck or projects in the garage, with the doors open, makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood.  \n\nHolidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with some families hosting out-of-town guests and additional vehicles parked on the streets. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas witness similar patterns. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant, with the exception of the through-traffic.",

It's a unique environment where verdant lawns are a rarity, and their presence often signifies significant financial investment in maintenance.  \n\nWhile the neighborhood was once more spread out, recent years have witnessed considerable development, blurring the lines between rural and urban living. Despite this transformation, the area retains a friendly atmosphere, with many long-time residents.  \n\nThe local commerce primarily consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, with larger, upscale options requiring a journey to other areas. Construction remains a dominant industry, fueled by ongoing development and abundant undeveloped land, a prospect that both excites and unnerves me. I moved here to escape the bustle of cities, and I'm hesitant to see that change. \n\nMy work in the construction industry aligns with this reality; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. \n\nLife here is enriched by the diverse wildlife that thrives in this unique ecosystem. From lizards to desert insects, the natural world fascinates my children and me. \n\nVictorville, while not without its charms, offers a different kind of desert experience. Visitors can enjoy the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which showcases local culture and entertainment.  A trip to nearby Wrightwood provides a stark contrast with its snow-capped mountains, ideal for winter sports enthusiasts.  \n\nFor those interested in the region's history and natural heritage, the Victor Valley Museum houses a collection of geological, paleontological, and cultural artifacts that shed light on the development of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood isn't typical. While most people might picture houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is the college campus where I live. My dormitory is my community, and the surrounding campus extends this feeling, though to a lesser extent.  Despite this difference, my campus shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. There are \"houses\" – apartments, individual houses, and dormitory buildings – each offering diverse living arrangements. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging around 20 residents per building. Individual houses, mostly rented by alumni, are less common but provide larger spaces for those who prefer it. The most prevalent housing type is the dormitory, accommodating hundreds of students in shared rooms.\n\nThe campus is incredibly diverse, reflecting the student body's multicultural makeup.  Professional staff often live in the individual houses, while newer students reside in dormitories and older students gravitate towards apartments.  \n\nThe campus is essentially a self-contained community with a variety of stores offering dining options, school-branded merchandise, and groceries.  A single park serves as a common space for everyone to enjoy, kept clean and safe by the community itself.",
            "Having lived in this neighborhood for ten years, I can share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was difficult. Leaving my friends and family behind was heartbreaking, but my parents believed this move offered better housing, schools, and opportunities. Over time, I adapted, made new friends and acquaintances, though some less pleasant than others. \n\nWhile I haven't formed close relationships with most neighbors, Mr. Glen and his family, along with Dennis who lived next door, have become like family to me. I cherish the memories we've shared, especially attending Mr. Glen's remarriage. It was a joyful occasion filled with dancing and laughter, and it reminds me of the future I envision for myself and my future wife.  \n\nThe neighborhood itself can be labyrinthine, but with GPS navigation, I'm gradually exploring its nooks and crannies. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, reminiscing about our shared love for video games.  I also find solace in the nearby park, where I practice balance exercises and swordplay, connecting with nature and finding inner peace. \n\nAlthough I haven't actively played basketball or tennis lately, the courts remain a reminder of my past enjoyment of these sports, thanks to my father who instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend under the guidance of Mr. Graves. \n\nFilled with fond memories and looking forward to new adventures, I believe the best is yet to come in this neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college. While mostly composed of apartments, it offers a few affordable restaurants and bars. The area is primarily inhabited by college students and lower-income residents due to the relatively inexpensive housing. The presence of a nearby elementary school contributes to the number of families in the neighborhood. Although I don't know my neighbors well, their frequent marijuana use has led to the building management installing an air freshener unit near their door, a humorous albeit slightly insulting gesture.\n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older, although some may have recently renovated interiors. Newer apartment complexes down the street, while aesthetically appealing, are built cheaply and charge exorbitant rents, taking advantage of their proximity to the university.\n\nThere's a budget-friendly restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly prepared in a microwave, and a gas station known for its unfavorable working conditions. Despite these quirks, the neighborhood has undergone improvements thanks to city funding, including a newly paved road, wider sidewalks, and landscaping.\n\nMy apartment building is nestled amidst trees, although some have been removed. Behind my complex lies a tree line and another set of apartments on a less desirable street with dilapidated sidewalks and shabby buildings. This street also experiences a higher rate of crime, concentrated in a particular apartment complex.\n\nDespite these challenges, I find my neighborhood livable and affordable, appreciating its proximity to the university and the convenience of nearby amenities like bus stops and the store.",
            "My neighborhood consists of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced out to resemble individual houses.  They all share a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs.  While not everyone knows each other, there's a strong sense of community, with neighbors often gathering in the evenings to chat while their children play. This idyllic atmosphere feels like a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields, trees, and clear blue skies, offering a picturesque setting. However, this peaceful existence was recently disrupted by a severe thunderstorm, complete with tornado warnings and sirens. I sought shelter in my bathtub with my small dog, while my larger dog nervously paced in the living room. The storm raged with heavy hail that pounded the ground, causing the road to steam from the sudden temperature drop.\n\nAs the storm cleared, a stunning double rainbow appeared, prompting me to grab my camera and capture the breathtaking sight. After an hour of quiet, neighbors slowly returned home, and life resumed its usual pace.\n\nDespite the uniformity of the exterior design, each duplex has its own unique interior. While I live in a comfortably sized two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, some units are surprisingly small.  \n\nI enjoy exploring the large field behind my house, leading to a picturesque pond where I've spotted deer and heard the croaking of bullfrogs.  The neighborhood is truly a gem, located just forty minutes from Charlotte, with the added charm of nearby farms, including one with a friendly donkey whose braying echoes through the evening air. I feel fortunate to have found this welcoming community.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood at the beginning of eighth grade. Adjusting and making friends was initially challenging, but I eventually formed close bonds with two neighbors who unfortunately no longer live here.  Despite this, the core community remains largely unchanged.  My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by two-story houses and a strong sense of community. Weekends and warm days are filled with the sounds of children playing, while the rest of the week is generally quiet. I've always felt safe and respected by my neighbors, with very few issues encountered over the years.  \n\nA nearby park holds many memories for me, from sports games with neighborhood friends to a particularly painful elbow injury I sustained during a football match. Despite the occasional mishap, the good memories outweigh the bad. Now, I frequent the park to spend time with my younger cousins, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.\n\nThe neighborhood boasts a diverse culinary scene, offering a range of cuisines within a short distance, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian. While delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, the neighborhood also features numerous fast food chains and pizza places. Essential stores are plentiful, with dry cleaners, pharmacies, and a large grocery store, Jewel-Osco.  Even local businesses contribute to the diversity, such as an Indian-owned store catering to those who enjoy home-cooked or ready-made Indian meals.\n\nOverall, I am grateful for my neighborhood.  Hearing about the challenges faced by others in their communities makes me appreciate the strong sense of safety and support I experience here.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, Johnston is a small town known as the \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  Agriculture is its lifeblood, with vast fields of peach trees and cattle grazing lands dominating the landscape.  The town's scattered houses, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, stand apart from each other, often set back from the roads to accommodate agricultural activities.\n\nThe town center, marked by a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, houses its limited retail options.  Fast food choices include Hong Kong (a family-run Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain.  A pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store, caters to residents, though many travel to larger stores in nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs.  Dollar General, a popular destination for everyday items, enjoys brisk business throughout the day.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing local furniture store, and its attached pet grooming business, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offer essential services.  A doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both small but well-equipped, serve the town's residents.  Johnston Elementary School provides education through fifth grade, with students continuing their studies in the neighboring town.\n\nWhile lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance amenities and attract new residents.  Life in Johnston is quiet, with limited entertainment options.   Despite its simplicity, it remains a charming and close-knit community.",
            "I first learned about my apartment building from a podcast about missing persons, which was surprising because it was in a relatively pricey area.  It seemed like no one else had heard the story, not even my friends. I understand the struggle of making ends meet; some of my friends experience financial stress and worry.  While things are expensive, we've learned to be resourceful, finding joy in bargain finds at flea markets and thrift stores.  The smell of adulthood, I've come to realize, is that of dusty flea market treasures and moth-eaten clothing.\n\nFortunately, my neighborhood is filled with thrift stores, libraries, and unique shops. Downtown is bustling with activity, but the quiet of these stores provides a welcome escape.\n\nThis city is rapidly developing, attracting major companies and a growing population, reminiscent of New York City. People here are focused on their individual goals and tend to keep to themselves.  There's a sense of independence and privacy, a stark contrast to the more communal atmosphere of the South.\n\nDespite the city's size and anonymity, I've found a sense of community among my neighbors. We support each other through life's milestones and challenges, creating a network of friendship.\n\nLiving in this massive, impersonal building, it's the connections I've made with my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban development with a strong homeowner's association.  The well-maintained, uniform single-family homes  feature similar front yards with landscaping, decorative stones, and short driveways.  Paved roads are in excellent condition throughout the neighborhood. While most homes are single-story, some are two stories. Instead of individual mailboxes, residents share a communal mailbox system with key access and package lockers.  Located on the outskirts of a relatively large city, the neighborhood has a mix of suburban and rural characteristics.  Residents enjoy access to community pools, gated walking trails, and ample open space. The community is predominantly composed of retirees, with a smaller number of middle-aged and young professionals.  While the city itself is sizable, it retains a small-town atmosphere. Residents have access to essential amenities, including a mall, a variety of grocery stores, and chain retailers, all within a short drive.  Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a comfortable suburban lifestyle with convenient access to both urban and recreational amenities.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. While my east-side neighborhood experiences economic hardship with lower property values and predominantly low-income residents, it's not undesirable. My neighbors are friendly, and despite slightly higher crime rates than other areas, it remains relatively safe. Although there have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, our family hasn't been directly affected beyond occasional petty theft. \n\nThe opioid epidemic has significantly impacted our town, leading to numerous fentanyl-related deaths. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available to combat this crisis.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has much to offer. My son thrives in his elementary school, which boasts excellent staff and a supportive environment. The school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry, and proactively addresses the needs of its diverse student body.\n\nWhile the town council has made beautification efforts, these primarily benefit the central business district and west side, leaving the east side comparatively neglected.  \n\nOverall, I find joy in living here. The friendly community, exceptional schools, diverse shopping options, and our comfortable home contribute to a sense of belonging. Having lived here for over 16 years, we feel deeply rooted in this town.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and history. Situated on a hill, it boasts beautiful old buildings, including an old theater across from my apartment building. A nearby arcade bar attracts diverse crowds on warm evenings, often leading to lines during summer weekends. The neighborhood also features a large city park, surrounded by concrete walls and steps. During winter, homeless individuals often find shelter in organized rows along the sidewalk and steps, seeking warmth and proximity to the nearby family center offering essential services. While the neighborhood's history and architecture are noteworthy, what truly captivates me is the resilience and spirit of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, carries the weight of its past. Stories of government crackdowns on crime persist, serving as reminders of the neighborhood's challenging history. Despite these hardships, the residents have worked diligently to uplift their community, taking pride in its cleanliness and safety. Despite warnings to avoid the area after dark for those who are not part of the community, I believe this reflects outdated prejudices and fear-based assumptions. I feel a sense of belonging in Hilltop, experiencing kindness and support from its residents. From offering a jacket in the cold to extending closing hours for my convenience, the people of Hilltop have shown me genuine compassion. On those bleak nights, when I felt invisible, they have surprised me with unexpected acts of kindness, reminding me of my inherent worth. Despite any challenges, Hilltop will always be my home, a place where I feel alive and connected to a community that embraces and uplifts its members.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural Michigan, transitioning from farmland to quaint tourist destinations.  There are no large shopping malls or chain stores like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's; everything requires a drive. Despite this, I live in a stunning location surrounded by lakes. My town is bordered by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering beaches within easy reach. My neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel. Houses are not crammed together and lack uniformity, showcasing older, diverse styles, some renovated and some retaining their original charm. Many have full basements visible from the street, and older aluminum siding is common. The neighborhood boasts a colorful array of houses, each with yards featuring trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets.\n\nThe residents are hardworking individuals, primarily focused on raising families or enjoying their later years. Children frequently play in the streets, while adults engage in activities like walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading.  A strong sense of community prevails, with neighbors recognizing and welcoming each other.  \n\nLawns are well-maintained, free of debris, with trimmed grass and bushes. While not outwardly extravagant, the neighborhood exudes a welcoming and safe atmosphere, ideal for raising a family. It's a place where people feel a sense of belonging and security. Conveniently located nearby are the county sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center, providing essential services to residents.\n\nThe area also features baseball and softball fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop, all within walking distance. My children can easily bike to the park, which is just eight blocks away.  Overall, it's a wonderful place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood is a vibrant mix of residential areas and commercial spaces within a large, diverse city. The commercial areas teem with a variety of businesses, from offices and large chain stores to smaller boutiques and unique eateries. Parks provide green spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself boasts a rich tapestry of cultures, including a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a sizable population of former Soviet Union immigrants. While other ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia are located nearby, they often feel geographically distant due to heavy traffic. Commuting by car can be a time-consuming ordeal, especially during rush hour, and walking is not a common mode of transportation. This reliance on cars contributes to the city's notorious traffic congestion and parking difficulties. Despite the challenges, the city is experiencing a surge in construction, with new apartment buildings popping up, potentially adding to the population and traffic woes. However, diverse housing options exist beyond these high-rises, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings.  The neighborhood itself is a mix of people from various ages and backgrounds, though a strong sense of community seems to be lacking in comparison to childhood memories of close-knit interactions with neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a blend of classic suburban charm and evolving realities. While most homes are single-family units, some have been converted into duplexes. My own house has a small front yard and driveway, reminiscent of a bygone era when suburban living symbolized the American dream. Although that dream feels less attainable today, my neighborhood still embodies its spirit.  Though residents may not be as optimistic as they once were, and yard maintenance isn't as meticulous, the presence of cars, children playing, and a well-established public school reflects a continued hold on this dream. \n\nChurches are sparse, but basketball courts remain bustling. Despite their varied appearances, the homes share a common feeling.  A large supermarket owned by a Yemenite family stands out in a predominantly African American neighborhood.  Wide streets host children playing football, and many residents have lived here for generations, cherishing a past defined by strong community ties.\n\nA former karate school, now a pharmacy, reflects the changing interests of youth. An old movie theater, showcasing classic films, caters to older residents while younger generations gravitate towards newer releases. The neighborhood is bisected by an expressway, though its entrance and exit are located in the neighboring town. A past petition for a local exit was met with resistance from elders who feared disruption.  \n\nCurrently, a new high school is under construction, and the community is debating a mascot.  For me, a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin best encapsulates the unique blend of tradition and change that defines my town.",
            "While seemingly unassuming nestled behind a shopping strip and an old, deserted Whole Foods, lies a vibrant, hidden community. Tucked away behind hotels primarily used for annual family reunions, you'll discover a cluster of apartment complexes resembling a line of carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls.  Some complexes have a less-than-stellar reputation, but others nearby offer a different experience, largely unknown to the surrounding area.  Opposite these complexes sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where sleepy students arrive for their morning classes, often causing frustration for commuting traffic. This road merges with a residential street featuring a park and a rehabilitation center with a welcoming atmosphere, where patients recover from various injuries. Children play in the park, while seniors walk their dogs and observe the neighborhood's teenage scene. Nearby, a strip mall offers a variety of shops, including a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, a frozen yogurt shop, and more, catering to the diverse needs of the community. This slice of Americana, with its slow pace of life and enduring traditions, feels timeless.",
            "She questioned my description of \"where everything was\" as we drove past endless cornfields. I knew she'd be surprised by the vastness of the landscape, coming from a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away. I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood my roots.\n\nOur journey took us down a two-lane country road to a quarry filled with water.  Just past it lay the small development where I live. The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land, meticulously kept. Springtime bursts with colorful flowers alongside the trees that transform with each season. Long driveways showcase gleaming Mercedes-Benz cars, sparkling after a good wash.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my friendly Korean neighbor, always outside tending to his lawn, greeted us.  He spends his days mowing, his singing echoing over the hum of his mower.  Everyone finds his antics amusing, but he's a kind and remarkable man with a fascinating past as a doctor.  His wit may have faded with age, but he blends seamlessly into the scenery with his John Deere mower.\n\nMy home is surrounded by geese, chased by our terrier.  A small stream behind the house flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms can be heard.  A wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, chasing animals, and playing with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinters in this small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The vibrant green yard transforms into a stark, wintry landscape.  Trees, once adorned with colorful flowers, stand bare and skeletal.  Snowfall turns the backyard into a winter wonderland, with snow angels and snowmen marking our play area.  My sister and I, though prone to fighting, used snowballs as our weapons, building elaborate igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal.\"  In our own winter paradise, we were simply carefree kids, lost in our pretend world.",

While Portland has experienced growth and gentrification, its quirky essence persists.  \n\n\"Weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean unaccepting, but rather an acceptance of the unconventional.  Despite modern conveniences and challenges shared with other cities, Portland maintains a distinct character. It's a place where yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and professionals coexist, perhaps with a more lighthearted approach to life. \n\nNeighborhoods showcase this spirit through vibrant houses, flourishing gardens, and the intriguing tradition of \"free boxes,\" filled with unexpected treasures.  Portland's magic lies in its diverse offerings, from goat yoga to soccer matches, appealing to a wide range of interests. \n\nHowever, Portland, like many cities, grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, rooted in complex social and economic factors. While the city's social services strive to help, the challenges remain significant.\n\nUltimately, Portland's \"weirdness\" extends beyond the unusual.

            "The mountains, permanently visible to the north, serve as a constant presence in my life.  No matter how busy I get, they are always there, steadfast and unyielding. When stress consumes me, they beckon me to find solace in their presence, offering a sense of strength to carry on.  \n\nI first fell in love with these mountains during my undergraduate years. While the university itself has its own charms, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.  The town surrounding the university is equally captivating. It boasts vibrant cafes, a historic downtown area with charming brick buildings, and a peaceful suburban atmosphere just a short distance away. This blend of urban and rural vibes creates a unique and inviting atmosphere.\n\nMy time here has been filled with both joyful and painful memories. I've shared laughter with friends in the park, enjoyed movie nights in the downtown theater, and found solace by the pond during moments of introspection and despair.\n\nOne particular walk along the pond, amidst the peaceful surroundings, sparked a reflection on my own purpose in life.

Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, featuring large, glass-fronted upper stories to capture the vista. While sunsets over the bay are breathtaking, the area is often overcast, resulting in a hazy view. The damp climate fosters moss growth on various surfaces, even cars.\n\nThe neighborhood primarily consists of older residents, many retired, with dogs being a common sight instead of children.

            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Situated between two state highways, our street experiences more traffic than I'd prefer, but it remains a peaceful community.  Due to the low turnover rate, I've become acquainted with most residents. Life here revolves around routine chores like yard work. During winter, we enjoy sledding on a nearby hill. As we live on a corner lot, we have a clear view of neighborhood activity and recognize most vehicles.  We notice unfamiliar cars, as our family is home frequently as we work remotely. My wife and I, along with our daughters aged eleven and fourteen, are a familiar presence.  We spend much of our time outdoors, even in inclement weather, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with the aroma of barbecue. Lawnmowers are a constant soundtrack from spring to fall, a testament to our abundant trees and lush greenery.  The abundance of trees also means dealing with leaf piles in autumn, which we rake and burn, a ritual that signifies the arrival of fall. Recent winters have been milder, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back, limits our use of the front door. Spending time in the garage, particularly with the doors open, allows me to better connect with the neighborhood. Holidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with out-of-town guests and parked cars. Overall, I cherish our suburban life. If it weren't for the through-traffic, it would be idyllic.",

While it's progressively resembling a city, this trend is mirrored in many other places.

My neighborhood, in particular, boasts a high concentration of pleasant elderly individuals.  \n\nFor shopping, we primarily rely on chain stores such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale options, one must travel elsewhere, as there aren't any Whole Foods or similar establishments. Based on observation rather than official data, the most prevalent job sector in our city appears to be construction. This is likely due to the city's ongoing development and the abundance of undeveloped land. This rapid expansion concerns me, as I prefer the current state of affairs. Having left a bustling city, I'm hesitant to return to that lifestyle.\n\nMy full-time employment is in the construction industry, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer.  \n\nOne of the aspects I cherish about living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain have fostered challenging ecosystems that require protection and are home to a variety of creatures. It's essential for human residents to understand and respect these non-human inhabitants to ensure a harmonious coexistence. My family and I have adapted well to sharing our environment with wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write, they are actively trying to collect specimens.\n\nVictorville offers several attractions and is an excellent destination for families seeking a desert experience. A visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair is highly recommended, as it provides a diverse range of activities and entertainment. For a change of scenery, consider a trip to nearby Wrightwood, where you can enjoy snow-covered mountains and participate in winter sports. \n\nIf you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that shed light on the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood isn't typical because I consider my college campus and dormitory to be my community. Although unconventional, it shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. There are various types of housing: dorms, apartments, and houses rented by alumni or staff. Dorms, the most common, house hundreds of students in shared rooms. Apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, while houses offer more spacious living for a smaller number. \n\nMy neighborhood is diverse, reflecting the school's commitment to inclusivity. Students from various backgrounds and ages live here, with younger students in dorms, older students in apartments, and staff in houses. \n\nThe campus itself provides a range of stores, including dining options, clothing stores, and even groceries, making it self-sufficient. A central park serves as a gathering place for the community, maintained and safe thanks to the collective effort of its residents.",
            "After living in my Stockbridge neighborhood for 10 years, I can share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale was tough. I missed my old friends and cried, but my parents believed this move offered better housing, a superior high school, and a safer environment. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends and some rivals, though I never truly connected with most neighbors except Mr. Glen and his family, and briefly Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish their friendship. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage ceremony with my family. It was a joyous occasion, inspiring me to envision my own future wedding and providing my future wife with a life of comfort and luxury. I even caught Mr. Glen's wife's wedding accessory during the celebration! While I didn't catch the bouquet, we danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's thriving. \n\nThe neighborhood's layout is complex, but with a GPS, I'm exploring it more. My explorations have led me to spend time with friends Kason and Curtis, whom I've shared countless hours of video games and joyful moments with. I also find solace in the local park, where I connect with nature, find peace, and practice my balance and swordsmanship skills. The basketball and tennis courts, although underutilized lately, serve as a reminder of my childhood passion for tennis, nurtured by my father and my best friend under the guidance of Mr. Graves.  \n\nLooking back, this neighborhood has been a source of joy and countless memories. I anticipate many more fulfilling experiences in the years to come.",
            "My neighborhood, located close to my college, is a mix of old apartment buildings, a few affordable restaurants and bars, and a couple of newer, more expensive complexes. While the neighborhood has a predominantly student and lower-income population, there's a noticeable presence of children due to a nearby elementary school. Despite some quirks, like the air freshener unit placed near a door notorious for weed smoking, I find the area generally pleasant. The older buildings, though somewhat outdated, often boast renovated interiors. The newer complexes, while modern, feel cheaply built and overpriced, taking advantage of their proximity to campus.  \n\nThe area has its share of inexpensive eats, including a budget-friendly eatery that serves food on paper plates. There's also a gas station, known for being a less desirable workplace. However, recent city improvements have revitalized the neighborhood with a wider sidewalk, grassy medians, and a more appealing aesthetic.\n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees, providing a sense of seclusion. The adjacent street, 43rd, is less appealing with dilapidated sidewalks and run-down buildings.  While crime has been reported in both my street and the adjacent one, I find the convenience and affordability of my location outweigh the negatives.  The proximity to the university and easy access to transportation are definite pluses.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses.  Every unit shares a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs.  While not everyone knows each other, a strong sense of community exists, with neighbors often gathering in driveways for casual conversations while their children play. This peaceful atmosphere feels like a throwback to simpler times, especially compared to our fast-paced, technology-driven world.  \n\nSurrounded by fields, trees, and expansive skies, the neighborhood offers a tranquil setting.  However, this season, we've experienced the unsettling reality of tornado warnings, culminating in a recent siren alert that forced us to seek shelter. I huddled in my bathtub with my youngest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog remained anxious and barking in the living room.  \n\nThe storm brought heavy hail, which melted instantly upon impact with the hot pavement, leaving a steamy residue in its wake.  As the clouds parted, a majestic double rainbow appeared, prompting me to capture its beauty with my camera.\n\nLife quickly returned to normal after the storm, with children and mothers resuming their outdoor routines.  I feel fortunate to have found this friendly community, particularly as a recent transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I enjoy the local Southern accents and the unique charm of our two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, despite their outward uniformity.  \n\nBeyond our homes, a large field and a pond provide a haven for wildlife, including deer and a melodious bullfrog.  This idyllic setting, just forty minutes from Charlotte, feels like a small village, complete with the sounds of roosters crowing and a nearby donkey braying in the evenings.  I consider myself truly lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. Making friends initially was tough, but I connected with two neighbors who, though they've since moved, remain in my memories. Most original residents are still here. The neighborhood is typical of many American suburbs, featuring mostly two-story houses. Weekends and warm days often bring the sound of children playing outdoors. It's generally quiet, except for the occasional playful sounds. I've always felt safe and secure here; I've never encountered any issues with neighbors and packages have never been stolen from my porch.  \n\nThere's a park just a short walk away, filled with memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with neighborhood friends. While I have a few less-pleasant memories there too, the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park mainly to spend time with my younger cousins, who enjoy the swings and slides.  The park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of culinary options within a short radius. From Chinese and Indian to Mexican and Italian, there's something to satisfy every craving. While some people opt for food delivery services, local favorites include fast food restaurants and pizza places.  \n\nConvenience is a hallmark of the area, with dry cleaners, pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store all within easy reach. Even specialty stores cater to diverse needs, like an Indian-owned shop for those who enjoy home-cooked meals or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm happy to call this neighborhood home. Hearing about the troubles others face with their neighbors makes me appreciate how fortunate I am.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, unassuming town in South Carolina. While it might not stand out visually, it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry, earning the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is largely defined by its farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches dominating the landscape. \n\nHouses are scattered throughout the countryside, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, often set back from the road to accommodate farm activities.  The main town area features a single traffic light at the intersection of four roads, where the town's limited commercial establishments are concentrated.\n\nFood options are modest, with a Chinese takeout restaurant, a Mexican eatery, and a local burger chain. A pharmacy known for its Cherry Coca-Cola and a small grocery store, IGA, cater to residents' needs, although many choose to travel to a larger Walmart in a nearby town for more extensive shopping.  Dollar General, surprisingly, is the most popular store in town, offering a wide range of everyday items.\n\nOther businesses include a long-standing furniture store with delivery service, a pet grooming facility, and small doctor's and veterinary practices.  The town's elementary school serves students until fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in a neighboring town.  While lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a small recreational area to provide residents with more leisure options.\n\nLife in Johnston is quiet and unpretentious, lacking the amenities found in larger cities. There are no theaters, bowling alleys, or vibrant gathering places. However, its charm lies in its simplicity and close-knit community. It's a place you could easily drive through without noticing, but it holds a unique appeal for those who appreciate its rural tranquility.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood through a podcast about missing persons, which was surprising because the area was known for its high rent.  It seemed like everyone was struggling financially, and my friends and I had learned to be frugal, finding joy in secondhand treasures and embracing the scent of aging things. Despite the city's growth and its bustling streets, I found solace in the quiet of the nearby thrift stores.  Despite the constant influx of people and cars, the stores offered a peaceful refuge. The city's rapid development, reminiscent of New York, fostered a sense of individual independence. People largely kept to themselves, creating a space where privacy and quiet were valued.  \n\nUnlike the more social South, where concern for others was expected, this city offered anonymity. It was possible to maintain a sense of detachment, and the city seemed to roll on regardless. Yet, within this anonymity, a sense of community emerged. We, the residents, connected through shared needs, celebrations, and sorrows. \n\nLiving in a vast, impersonal apartment complex, I found comfort in the kindness of my neighbors. We looked after each other, shared meals, and offered support. They made this place feel less like a cold, impersonal space and more like a home. Despite the city's overwhelming scale, the connections I made with my neighbors gave me a sense of belonging and reminded me that I hadn't made a complete failure of my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowner's association presence.  The houses are uniformly well-maintained single-family homes with similar front yards featuring lawns, decorative stones, and short driveways.  \n\nThe roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA, and most houses are single-story, though some have two stories.  Unique to my neighborhood is the shared mailbox system, resembling apartments more than traditional single-family homes.\n\nLocated on the outskirts of a larger city, our area blends suburban and rural elements. We enjoy ample green space with community pools, gated and well-maintained, and walking trails for residents to enjoy.  The neighborhood is predominantly populated by retirees, creating a safe and friendly atmosphere.  \n\nWhile there are some middle-aged and young professionals, the city itself, despite its large population, retains a small-town vibe.  We have essential amenities, including a mall that caters to a variety of shopping needs, from high-end grocery stores to budget-friendly outlets.\n\nAlthough a short drive is required for major shopping, my neighborhood offers a safe, well-kept environment with convenient amenities and a strong sense of community.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is economically disadvantaged, characterized by low property values and residents with lower incomes. However, it's not unappealing; neighbors are friendly and crime, while slightly higher than other parts of town, remains generally low. There have been isolated incidents, including shootings and a homicide, but our family hasn't been directly affected beyond occasional porch thefts.\n\nThe town, like many in the US, has been deeply impacted by the opioid epidemic, resulting in several fentanyl overdose deaths. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available.\n\nDespite these challenges, the town offers positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff and a welcoming environment where he thrives despite having special needs. An active PTO fosters family involvement and educational progress.  \n\nThe school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, addressing the town's 20%+ poverty rate. No child or family faces stigma due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonably priced.\n\nWhile city improvements like road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations have primarily benefited the central, west side, the east side, where I live, remains neglected, a source of concern for residents.\n\nOverall, I find joy in living here. The friendly people, excellent schools, convenient shopping options, and our comfortable home make it a place we've called home for over 16 years and wouldn't trade for anything else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is rich in history and culture. Situated on a hillside, it's filled with buildings that tell stories of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building near a historic theater and a popular arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds, especially on warm summer evenings. A nearby park, though small for its location, provides a gathering space, and during winter, it becomes a temporary shelter for the homeless, who find warmth and security in their close proximity to a nearby community center offering essential services.  \n\nWhile Hilltop's historical architecture is impressive, what truly makes it special is its resilient community. Once notorious for gang violence, the neighborhood still bears the scars of its past, with stories passed down through generations. Despite its challenging reputation, residents work hard to maintain their community, taking pride in their surroundings. \n\nSome warn against walking alone in Hilltop after dark, a warning I believe stems from outdated perceptions and ingrained biases. Perhaps because of my own background, I feel accepted and safe here. Hilltop reflects the complexities of our nation, where racism and prejudice persist despite efforts towards inclusivity. \n\nHowever, Hilltop is more than just its history or its struggles. It's a place where I feel a sense of belonging. I've experienced kindness and generosity from its residents, who have offered me support and warmth when I needed it most. It's a neighborhood where people look out for each other, where strangers become friends, and where I feel truly alive.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural Michigan, nestled between farmland and tourist destinations.  Unlike larger cities, we lack chain stores like malls, Walmart, Target, or even restaurants like Applebee's.  Getting around requires driving, but the trade-off is living in a stunningly beautiful area surrounded by water. My town is bordered by both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering easy access to beaches.\n\nThe neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel.  Houses are spaced out, each with its own unique character, ranging from updated and remodeled homes to older, more traditional ones. Many feature full basements visible from the street and older aluminum siding.  The streets are a vibrant mix of colorful houses, most with yards boasting trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even enclosures for animals.\n\nThe residents reflect the hardworking spirit of Middle America, raising or having raised families.  Children play freely in the streets, while adults are often seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. A strong sense of community prevails, with neighbors knowing each other and a clear distinction between those who belong and those who don't.\n\nA friendly atmosphere permeates the area.  Neighbors exchange waves and smiles, whether grilling outside or walking their dogs.  Lawns are well-maintained, reflecting a sense of pride and care.\n\nWhile not flashy, the neighborhood exudes a warmth and welcoming atmosphere, ideal for raising a family.  It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. The nearby presence of the sheriff's department, jail, health department, recycling center, and recreational facilities further contribute to its sense of security and convenience.\n\nThe sound of baseball games and small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport add a unique charm to everyday life.  A local ice cream shop is within walking distance, and the downtown area is a short bike ride away.\n\nOverall, this small town offers a high quality of life, with its strong sense of community, beautiful surroundings, and convenient amenities."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood is a vibrant mix of residential areas and commercial spaces within a large, diverse city. The commercial areas teem with a variety of businesses, from offices and large chain stores to smaller boutiques and unique eateries. Parks provide green spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself boasts a rich tapestry of cultures, including a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a sizable population of former Soviet Union immigrants. While other ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia are located nearby, they often feel geographically distant due to heavy traffic. Commuting by car can be a time-consuming ordeal, especially during rush hour, and walking is not a common mode of transportation. This reliance on cars contributes to the city's notorious traffic congestion and parking difficulties. Despite the challenges, the city is experiencing a surge in construction, with new apartment buildings popping up, potentially adding to the population and traffic woes. However, diverse housing options exist beyond these high-rises, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings.  The neighborhood itself is a mix of people from various ages and backgrounds, though a strong sense of community seems to be lacking in comparison to childhood memories of close-knit interactions with neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a blend of classic suburban charm and evolving realities. While most homes are single-family units, some have been converted into duplexes. My own house has a small front yard and driveway, reminiscent of a bygone era when suburban living symbolized the American dream. Although that dream feels less attainable today, my neighborhood still embodies its spirit.  Though residents may not be as optimistic as they once were, and yard maintenance isn't as meticulous, the presence of cars, children playing, and a well-established public school reflects a continued hold on this dream. \n\nChurches are sparse, but basketball courts remain bustling. Despite their varied appearances, the homes share a common feeling.  A large supermarket owned by a Yemenite family stands out in a predominantly African American neighborhood.  Wide streets host children playing football, and many residents have lived here for generations, cherishing a past defined by strong community ties.\n\nA former karate school, now a pharmacy, reflects the changing interests of youth. An old movie theater, showcasing classic films, caters to older residents while younger generations gravitate towards newer releases. The neighborhood is bisected by an expressway, though its entrance and exit are located in the neighboring town. A past petition for a local exit was met with resistance from elders who feared disruption.  \n\nCurrently, a new high school is under construction, and the community is debating a mascot.  For me, a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin best encapsulates the unique blend of tradition and change that defines my town.",

Some complexes have a less-than-stellar reputation, but others nearby offer a different experience, largely unknown to the surrounding area.  Opposite these complexes sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where sleepy students arrive for their morning classes, often causing frustration for commuting traffic. This road merges with a residential street featuring a park and a rehabilitation center with a welcoming atmosphere, where patients recover from various injuries. Children play in the park, while seniors walk their dogs and observe the neighborhood's teenage scene. Nearby, a strip mall offers a variety of shops, including a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, a frozen yogurt shop, and more, catering to the diverse needs of the community.

            "She questioned my description of \"where everything was\" as we drove past endless cornfields. I knew she'd be surprised by the vastness of the landscape, coming from a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away. I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood my roots.\n\nOur journey took us down a two-lane country road to a quarry filled with water.  Just past it lay the small development where I live. The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land, meticulously kept. Springtime bursts with colorful flowers alongside the trees that transform with each season. Long driveways showcase gleaming Mercedes-Benz cars, sparkling after a good wash.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my friendly Korean neighbor, always outside tending to his lawn, greeted us.  He spends his days mowing, his singing echoing over the hum of his mower.  Everyone finds his antics amusing, but he's a kind and remarkable man with a fascinating past as a doctor.  His wit may have faded with age, but he blends seamlessly into the scenery with his John Deere mower.\n\nMy home is surrounded by geese, chased by our terrier.  A small stream behind the house flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms can be heard.  A wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, chasing animals, and playing with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinters in this small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The vibrant green yard transforms into a stark, wintry landscape.  Trees, once adorned with colorful flowers, stand bare and skeletal.  Snowfall turns the backyard into a winter wonderland, with snow angels and snowmen marking our play area.  My sister and I, though prone to fighting, used snowballs as our weapons, building elaborate igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal.\"  In our own winter paradise, we were simply carefree kids, lost in our pretend world.",

            "The mountains, permanently visible to the north, serve as a constant presence in my life.  No matter how busy I get, they are always there, steadfast and unyielding. When stress consumes me, they beckon me to find solace in their presence, offering a sense of strength to carry on.  \n\nI first fell in love with these mountains during my undergraduate years.

This blend of urban and rural vibes creates a unique and inviting atmosphere.\n\nMy time here has been filled with both joyful and painful memories.

The damp climate fosters moss growth on various surfaces, even cars.\n\nThe neighborhood primarily consists of older residents, many retired, with dogs being a common sight instead of children. There's a local school nearby, but not many young families reside in the area. Rabbits are abundant, causing problems for gardeners but providing amusement for cats. Various birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasional hawks or eagles, inhabit the neighborhood.\n\nWhile there are no local stores, a few seafood restaurants can be found at the waterfront a short distance away. The beach is limited, but rocky shores offer a spot for throwing stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, allowing for clear views of the opposite shore even through the frequent mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Situated between two state highways, our street experiences more traffic than I'd prefer, but it remains a peaceful community.  Due to the low turnover rate, I've become acquainted with most residents. Life here revolves around routine chores like yard work. During winter, we enjoy sledding on a nearby hill. As we live on a corner lot, we have a clear view of neighborhood activity and recognize most vehicles.  We notice unfamiliar cars, as our family is home frequently as we work remotely. My wife and I, along with our daughters aged eleven and fourteen, are a familiar presence.  We spend much of our time outdoors, even in inclement weather, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with the aroma of barbecue. Lawnmowers are a constant soundtrack from spring to fall, a testament to our abundant trees and lush greenery.  The abundance of trees also means dealing with leaf piles in autumn, which we rake and burn, a ritual that signifies the arrival of fall. Recent winters have been milder, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back, limits our use of the front door. Spending time in the garage, particularly with the doors open, allows me to better connect with the neighborhood. Holidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with out-of-town guests and parked cars. Overall, I cherish our suburban life. If it weren't for the through-traffic, it would be idyllic.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, characterized by its expanse of dry, dusty landscape. Unless you've personally lived here, it's difficult to grasp the constant visual dominance of brown hues. The presence of a green lawn indicates significant financial investment in its upkeep.  Since the 1990s, when I first settled here, the area has become more populated, with numerous new developments. While it's progressively resembling a city, this trend is mirrored in many other places. The residents are generally friendly, although, like any urban environment, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood, in particular, boasts a high concentration of pleasant elderly individuals.  \n\nFor shopping, we primarily rely on chain stores such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale options, one must travel elsewhere, as there aren't any Whole Foods or similar establishments. Based on observation rather than official data, the most prevalent job sector in our city appears to be construction. This is likely due to the city's ongoing development and the abundance of undeveloped land. This rapid expansion concerns me, as I prefer the current state of affairs. Having left a bustling city, I'm hesitant to return to that lifestyle.\n\nMy full-time employment is in the construction industry, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer.  \n\nOne of the aspects I cherish about living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain have fostered challenging ecosystems that require protection and are home to a variety of creatures. It's essential for human residents to understand and respect these non-human inhabitants to ensure a harmonious coexistence. My family and I have adapted well to sharing our environment with wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write, they are actively trying to collect specimens.\n\nVictorville offers several attractions and is an excellent destination for families seeking a desert experience. A visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair is highly recommended, as it provides a diverse range of activities and entertainment. For a change of scenery, consider a trip to nearby Wrightwood, where you can enjoy snow-covered mountains and participate in winter sports. \n\nIf you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that shed light on the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood isn't typical because I consider my college campus and dormitory to be my community. Although unconventional, it shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. There are various types of housing: dorms, apartments, and houses rented by alumni or staff. Dorms, the most common, house hundreds of students in shared rooms. Apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, while houses offer more spacious living for a smaller number. \n\nMy neighborhood is diverse, reflecting the school's commitment to inclusivity. Students from various backgrounds and ages live here, with younger students in dorms, older students in apartments, and staff in houses. \n\nThe campus itself provides a range of stores, including dining options, clothing stores, and even groceries, making it self-sufficient. A central park serves as a gathering place for the community, maintained and safe thanks to the collective effort of its residents.",
            "After living in my Stockbridge neighborhood for 10 years, I can share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale was tough. I missed my old friends and cried, but my parents believed this move offered better housing, a superior high school, and a safer environment. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends and some rivals, though I never truly connected with most neighbors except Mr. Glen and his family, and briefly Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish their friendship. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage ceremony with my family. It was a joyous occasion, inspiring me to envision my own future wedding and providing my future wife with a life of comfort and luxury. I even caught Mr. Glen's wife's wedding accessory during the celebration! While I didn't catch the bouquet, we danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's thriving. \n\nThe neighborhood's layout is complex, but with a GPS, I'm exploring it more. My explorations have led me to spend time with friends Kason and Curtis, whom I've shared countless hours of video games and joyful moments with. I also find solace in the local park, where I connect with nature, find peace, and practice my balance and swordsmanship skills. The basketball and tennis courts, although underutilized lately, serve as a reminder of my childhood passion for tennis, nurtured by my father and my best friend under the guidance of Mr. Graves.  \n\nLooking back, this neighborhood has been a source of joy and countless memories. I anticipate many more fulfilling experiences in the years to come.",
            "My neighborhood, located close to my college, is a mix of old apartment buildings, a few affordable restaurants and bars, and a couple of newer, more expensive complexes. While the neighborhood has a predominantly student and lower-income population, there's a noticeable presence of children due to a nearby elementary school. Despite some quirks, like the air freshener unit placed near a door notorious for weed smoking, I find the area generally pleasant. The older buildings, though somewhat outdated, often boast renovated interiors. The newer complexes, while modern, feel cheaply built and overpriced, taking advantage of their proximity to campus.  \n\nThe area has its share of inexpensive eats, including a budget-friendly eatery that serves food on paper plates. There's also a gas station, known for being a less desirable workplace. However, recent city improvements have revitalized the neighborhood with a wider sidewalk, grassy medians, and a more appealing aesthetic.\n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees, providing a sense of seclusion. The adjacent street, 43rd, is less appealing with dilapidated sidewalks and run-down buildings.  While crime has been reported in both my street and the adjacent one, I find the convenience and affordability of my location outweigh the negatives.  The proximity to the university and easy access to transportation are definite pluses.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses.  Every unit shares a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs.  While not everyone knows each other, a strong sense of community exists, with neighbors often gathering in driveways for casual conversations while their children play. This peaceful atmosphere feels like a throwback to simpler times, especially compared to our fast-paced, technology-driven world.  \n\nSurrounded by fields, trees, and expansive skies, the neighborhood offers a tranquil setting.  However, this season, we've experienced the unsettling reality of tornado warnings, culminating in a recent siren alert that forced us to seek shelter. I huddled in my bathtub with my youngest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog remained anxious and barking in the living room.  \n\nThe storm brought heavy hail, which melted instantly upon impact with the hot pavement, leaving a steamy residue in its wake.  As the clouds parted, a majestic double rainbow appeared, prompting me to capture its beauty with my camera.\n\nLife quickly returned to normal after the storm, with children and mothers resuming their outdoor routines.  I feel fortunate to have found this friendly community, particularly as a recent transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I enjoy the local Southern accents and the unique charm of our two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, despite their outward uniformity.  \n\nBeyond our homes, a large field and a pond provide a haven for wildlife, including deer and a melodious bullfrog.  This idyllic setting, just forty minutes from Charlotte, feels like a small village, complete with the sounds of roosters crowing and a nearby donkey braying in the evenings.  I consider myself truly lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. Making friends initially was tough, but I connected with two neighbors who, though they've since moved, remain in my memories. Most original residents are still here. The neighborhood is typical of many American suburbs, featuring mostly two-story houses. Weekends and warm days often bring the sound of children playing outdoors. It's generally quiet, except for the occasional playful sounds. I've always felt safe and secure here; I've never encountered any issues with neighbors and packages have never been stolen from my porch.  \n\nThere's a park just a short walk away, filled with memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with neighborhood friends. While I have a few less-pleasant memories there too, the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park mainly to spend time with my younger cousins, who enjoy the swings and slides.  The park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of culinary options within a short radius. From Chinese and Indian to Mexican and Italian, there's something to satisfy every craving. While some people opt for food delivery services, local favorites include fast food restaurants and pizza places.  \n\nConvenience is a hallmark of the area, with dry cleaners, pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store all within easy reach. Even specialty stores cater to diverse needs, like an Indian-owned shop for those who enjoy home-cooked meals or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm happy to call this neighborhood home. Hearing about the troubles others face with their neighbors makes me appreciate how fortunate I am.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, unassuming town in South Carolina. While it might not stand out visually, it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry, earning the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is largely defined by its farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches dominating the landscape. \n\nHouses are scattered throughout the countryside, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, often set back from the road to accommodate farm activities.  The main town area features a single traffic light at the intersection of four roads, where the town's limited commercial establishments are concentrated.\n\nFood options are modest, with a Chinese takeout restaurant, a Mexican eatery, and a local burger chain. A pharmacy known for its Cherry Coca-Cola and a small grocery store, IGA, cater to residents' needs, although many choose to travel to a larger Walmart in a nearby town for more extensive shopping.  Dollar General, surprisingly, is the most popular store in town, offering a wide range of everyday items.\n\nOther businesses include a long-standing furniture store with delivery service, a pet grooming facility, and small doctor's and veterinary practices.  The town's elementary school serves students until fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in a neighboring town.  While lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a small recreational area to provide residents with more leisure options.\n\nLife in Johnston is quiet and unpretentious, lacking the amenities found in larger cities. There are no theaters, bowling alleys, or vibrant gathering places. However, its charm lies in its simplicity and close-knit community. It's a place you could easily drive through without noticing, but it holds a unique appeal for those who appreciate its rural tranquility.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood through a podcast about missing persons, which was surprising because the area was known for its high rent.  It seemed like everyone was struggling financially, and my friends and I had learned to be frugal, finding joy in secondhand treasures and embracing the scent of aging things. Despite the city's growth and its bustling streets, I found solace in the quiet of the nearby thrift stores.  Despite the constant influx of people and cars, the stores offered a peaceful refuge. The city's rapid development, reminiscent of New York, fostered a sense of individual independence. People largely kept to themselves, creating a space where privacy and quiet were valued.  \n\nUnlike the more social South, where concern for others was expected, this city offered anonymity. It was possible to maintain a sense of detachment, and the city seemed to roll on regardless. Yet, within this anonymity, a sense of community emerged. We, the residents, connected through shared needs, celebrations, and sorrows. \n\nLiving in a vast, impersonal apartment complex, I found comfort in the kindness of my neighbors. We looked after each other, shared meals, and offered support. They made this place feel less like a cold, impersonal space and more like a home. Despite the city's overwhelming scale, the connections I made with my neighbors gave me a sense of belonging and reminded me that I hadn't made a complete failure of my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowner's association presence.  The houses are uniformly well-maintained single-family homes with similar front yards featuring lawns, decorative stones, and short driveways.  \n\nThe roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA, and most houses are single-story, though some have two stories.  Unique to my neighborhood is the shared mailbox system, resembling apartments more than traditional single-family homes.\n\nLocated on the outskirts of a larger city, our area blends suburban and rural elements. We enjoy ample green space with community pools, gated and well-maintained, and walking trails for residents to enjoy.  The neighborhood is predominantly populated by retirees, creating a safe and friendly atmosphere.  \n\nWhile there are some middle-aged and young professionals, the city itself, despite its large population, retains a small-town vibe.  We have essential amenities, including a mall that caters to a variety of shopping needs, from high-end grocery stores to budget-friendly outlets.\n\nAlthough a short drive is required for major shopping, my neighborhood offers a safe, well-kept environment with convenient amenities and a strong sense of community.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is economically disadvantaged, characterized by low property values and residents with lower incomes. However, it's not unappealing; neighbors are friendly and crime, while slightly higher than other parts of town, remains generally low. There have been isolated incidents, including shootings and a homicide, but our family hasn't been directly affected beyond occasional porch thefts.\n\nThe town, like many in the US, has been deeply impacted by the opioid epidemic, resulting in several fentanyl overdose deaths. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available.\n\nDespite these challenges, the town offers positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff and a welcoming environment where he thrives despite having special needs. An active PTO fosters family involvement and educational progress.  \n\nThe school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, addressing the town's 20%+ poverty rate. No child or family faces stigma due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonably priced.\n\nWhile city improvements like road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations have primarily benefited the central, west side, the east side, where I live, remains neglected, a source of concern for residents.\n\nOverall, I find joy in living here. The friendly people, excellent schools, convenient shopping options, and our comfortable home make it a place we've called home for over 16 years and wouldn't trade for anything else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is rich in history and culture. Situated on a hillside, it's filled with buildings that tell stories of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building near a historic theater and a popular arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds, especially on warm summer evenings. A nearby park, though small for its location, provides a gathering space, and during winter, it becomes a temporary shelter for the homeless, who find warmth and security in their close proximity to a nearby community center offering essential services.  \n\nWhile Hilltop's historical architecture is impressive, what truly makes it special is its resilient community. Once notorious for gang violence, the neighborhood still bears the scars of its past, with stories passed down through generations. Despite its challenging reputation, residents work hard to maintain their community, taking pride in their surroundings. \n\nSome warn against walking alone in Hilltop after dark, a warning I believe stems from outdated perceptions and ingrained biases. Perhaps because of my own background, I feel accepted and safe here. Hilltop reflects the complexities of our nation, where racism and prejudice persist despite efforts towards inclusivity. \n\nHowever, Hilltop is more than just its history or its struggles. It's a place where I feel a sense of belonging. I've experienced kindness and generosity from its residents, who have offered me support and warmth when I needed it most. It's a neighborhood where people look out for each other, where strangers become friends, and where I feel truly alive.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural Michigan, nestled between farmland and tourist destinations.  Unlike larger cities, we lack chain stores like malls, Walmart, Target, or even restaurants like Applebee's.  Getting around requires driving, but the trade-off is living in a stunningly beautiful area surrounded by water. My town is bordered by both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering easy access to beaches.\n\nThe neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel.  Houses are spaced out, each with its own unique character, ranging from updated and remodeled homes to older, more traditional ones. Many feature full basements visible from the street and older aluminum siding.  The streets are a vibrant mix of colorful houses, most with yards boasting trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even enclosures for animals.\n\nThe residents reflect the hardworking spirit of Middle America, raising or having raised families.  Children play freely in the streets, while adults are often seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. A strong sense of community prevails, with neighbors knowing each other and a clear distinction between those who belong and those who don't.\n\nA friendly atmosphere permeates the area.  Neighbors exchange waves and smiles, whether grilling outside or walking their dogs.  Lawns are well-maintained, reflecting a sense of pride and care.\n\nWhile not flashy, the neighborhood exudes a warmth and welcoming atmosphere, ideal for raising a family.  It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. The nearby presence of the sheriff's department, jail, health department, recycling center, and recreational facilities further contribute to its sense of security and convenience.\n\nThe sound of baseball games and small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport add a unique charm to everyday life.  A local ice cream shop is within walking distance, and the downtown area is a short bike ride away.\n\nOverall, this small town offers a high quality of life, with its strong sense of community, beautiful surroundings, and convenient amenities."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood is a vibrant mix of residential areas and commercial spaces within a large, diverse city. The commercial areas teem with a variety of businesses, from offices and large chain stores to smaller boutiques and unique eateries. Parks provide green spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself boasts a rich tapestry of cultures, including a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a sizable population of former Soviet Union immigrants. While other ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia are located nearby, they often feel geographically distant due to heavy traffic. Commuting by car can be a time-consuming ordeal, especially during rush hour, and walking is not a common mode of transportation. This reliance on cars contributes to the city's notorious traffic congestion and parking difficulties. Despite the challenges, the city is experiencing a surge in construction, with new apartment buildings popping up, potentially adding to the population and traffic woes. However, diverse housing options exist beyond these high-rises, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment buildings.  The neighborhood itself is a mix of people from various ages and backgrounds, though a strong sense of community seems to be lacking in comparison to childhood memories of close-knit interactions with neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a blend of classic suburban charm and evolving realities. While most homes are single-family units, some have been converted into duplexes. My own house has a small front yard and driveway, reminiscent of a bygone era when suburban living symbolized the American dream. Although that dream feels less attainable today, my neighborhood still embodies its spirit.  Though residents may not be as optimistic as they once were, and yard maintenance isn't as meticulous, the presence of cars, children playing, and a well-established public school reflects a continued hold on this dream. \n\nChurches are sparse, but basketball courts remain bustling. Despite their varied appearances, the homes share a common feeling.  A large supermarket owned by a Yemenite family stands out in a predominantly African American neighborhood.  Wide streets host children playing football, and many residents have lived here for generations, cherishing a past defined by strong community ties.\n\nA former karate school, now a pharmacy, reflects the changing interests of youth. An old movie theater, showcasing classic films, caters to older residents while younger generations gravitate towards newer releases. The neighborhood is bisected by an expressway, though its entrance and exit are located in the neighboring town. A past petition for a local exit was met with resistance from elders who feared disruption.  \n\nCurrently, a new high school is under construction, and the community is debating a mascot.  For me, a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin best encapsulates the unique blend of tradition and change that defines my town.",
            "While seemingly unassuming nestled behind a shopping strip and an old, deserted Whole Foods, lies a vibrant, hidden community. Tucked away behind hotels primarily used for annual family reunions, you'll discover a cluster of apartment complexes resembling a line of carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls.  Some complexes have a less-than-stellar reputation, but others nearby offer a different experience, largely unknown to the surrounding area.  Opposite these complexes sits a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where sleepy students arrive for their morning classes, often causing frustration for commuting traffic. This road merges with a residential street featuring a park and a rehabilitation center with a welcoming atmosphere, where patients recover from various injuries. Children play in the park, while seniors walk their dogs and observe the neighborhood's teenage scene. Nearby, a strip mall offers a variety of shops, including a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, a frozen yogurt shop, and more, catering to the diverse needs of the community. This slice of Americana, with its slow pace of life and enduring traditions, feels timeless.",
            "She questioned my description of \"where everything was\" as we drove past endless cornfields. I knew she'd be surprised by the vastness of the landscape, coming from a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away. I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood my roots.\n\nOur journey took us down a two-lane country road to a quarry filled with water.  Just past it lay the small development where I live. The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land, meticulously kept. Springtime bursts with colorful flowers alongside the trees that transform with each season. Long driveways showcase gleaming Mercedes-Benz cars, sparkling after a good wash.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my friendly Korean neighbor, always outside tending to his lawn, greeted us.  He spends his days mowing, his singing echoing over the hum of his mower.  Everyone finds his antics amusing, but he's a kind and remarkable man with a fascinating past as a doctor.  His wit may have faded with age, but he blends seamlessly into the scenery with his John Deere mower.\n\nMy home is surrounded by geese, chased by our terrier.  A small stream behind the house flows into the quarry, where bullfrogs croak and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms can be heard.  A wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts, chasing animals, and playing with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinters in this small town are harsh but breathtaking.  The vibrant green yard transforms into a stark, wintry landscape.  Trees, once adorned with colorful flowers, stand bare and skeletal.  Snowfall turns the backyard into a winter wonderland, with snow angels and snowmen marking our play area.  My sister and I, though prone to fighting, used snowballs as our weapons, building elaborate igloo-like forts to store our \"arsenal.\"  In our own winter paradise, we were simply carefree kids, lost in our pretend world.",

While Portland has experienced growth and gentrification, its quirky essence persists.  \n\n\"Weird\" in Portland doesn't necessarily mean unaccepting, but rather an acceptance of the unconventional.  Despite modern conveniences and challenges shared with other cities, Portland maintains a distinct character. It's a place where yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and professionals coexist, perhaps with a more lighthearted approach to life. \n\nNeighborhoods showcase this spirit through vibrant houses, flourishing gardens, and the intriguing tradition of \"free boxes,\" filled with unexpected treasures.  Portland's magic lies in its diverse offerings, from goat yoga to soccer matches, appealing to a wide range of interests. \n\nHowever, Portland, like many cities, grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, rooted in complex social and economic factors. While the city's social services strive to help, the challenges remain significant.\n\nUltimately, Portland's \"weirdness\" extends beyond the unusual.

            "The mountains, permanently visible to the north, serve as a constant presence in my life.  No matter how busy I get, they are always there, steadfast and unyielding. When stress consumes me, they beckon me to find solace in their presence, offering a sense of strength to carry on.  \n\nI first fell in love with these mountains during my undergraduate years. While the university itself has its own charms, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.  The town surrounding the university is equally captivating. It boasts vibrant cafes, a historic downtown area with charming brick buildings, and a peaceful suburban atmosphere just a short distance away. This blend of urban and rural vibes creates a unique and inviting atmosphere.\n\nMy time here has been filled with both joyful and painful memories. I've shared laughter with friends in the park, enjoyed movie nights in the downtown theater, and found solace by the pond during moments of introspection and despair.\n\nOne particular walk along the pond, amidst the peaceful surroundings, sparked a reflection on my own purpose in life.

Consequently, houses are built high on the hill, featuring large, glass-fronted upper stories to capture the vista. While sunsets over the bay are breathtaking, the area is often overcast, resulting in a hazy view. The damp climate fosters moss growth on various surfaces, even cars.\n\nThe neighborhood primarily consists of older residents, many retired, with dogs being a common sight instead of children.

            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Situated between two state highways, our street experiences more traffic than I'd prefer, but it remains a peaceful community.  Due to the low turnover rate, I've become acquainted with most residents. Life here revolves around routine chores like yard work. During winter, we enjoy sledding on a nearby hill. As we live on a corner lot, we have a clear view of neighborhood activity and recognize most vehicles.  We notice unfamiliar cars, as our family is home frequently as we work remotely. My wife and I, along with our daughters aged eleven and fourteen, are a familiar presence.  We spend much of our time outdoors, even in inclement weather, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with the aroma of barbecue. Lawnmowers are a constant soundtrack from spring to fall, a testament to our abundant trees and lush greenery.  The abundance of trees also means dealing with leaf piles in autumn, which we rake and burn, a ritual that signifies the arrival of fall. Recent winters have been milder, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back, limits our use of the front door. Spending time in the garage, particularly with the doors open, allows me to better connect with the neighborhood. Holidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with out-of-town guests and parked cars. Overall, I cherish our suburban life. If it weren't for the through-traffic, it would be idyllic.",
            "My neighborhood is situated in the heart of the high desert, characterized by its expanse of dry, dusty landscape. Unless you've personally lived here, it's difficult to grasp the constant visual dominance of brown hues. The presence of a green lawn indicates significant financial investment in its upkeep.  Since the 1990s, when I first settled here, the area has become more populated, with numerous new developments. While it's progressively resembling a city, this trend is mirrored in many other places. The residents are generally friendly, although, like any urban environment, there are both positive and negative aspects. My neighborhood, in particular, boasts a high concentration of pleasant elderly individuals.  \n\nFor shopping, we primarily rely on chain stores such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale options, one must travel elsewhere, as there aren't any Whole Foods or similar establishments. Based on observation rather than official data, the most prevalent job sector in our city appears to be construction. This is likely due to the city's ongoing development and the abundance of undeveloped land. This rapid expansion concerns me, as I prefer the current state of affairs. Having left a bustling city, I'm hesitant to return to that lifestyle.\n\nMy full-time employment is in the construction industry, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer.  \n\nOne of the aspects I cherish about living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain have fostered challenging ecosystems that require protection and are home to a variety of creatures. It's essential for human residents to understand and respect these non-human inhabitants to ensure a harmonious coexistence. My family and I have adapted well to sharing our environment with wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write, they are actively trying to collect specimens.\n\nVictorville offers several attractions and is an excellent destination for families seeking a desert experience. A visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair is highly recommended, as it provides a diverse range of activities and entertainment. For a change of scenery, consider a trip to nearby Wrightwood, where you can enjoy snow-covered mountains and participate in winter sports. \n\nIf you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum is a must-visit. It houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that shed light on the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood isn't typical because I consider my college campus and dormitory to be my community. Although unconventional, it shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. There are various types of housing: dorms, apartments, and houses rented by alumni or staff. Dorms, the most common, house hundreds of students in shared rooms. Apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, while houses offer more spacious living for a smaller number. \n\nMy neighborhood is diverse, reflecting the school's commitment to inclusivity. Students from various backgrounds and ages live here, with younger students in dorms, older students in apartments, and staff in houses. \n\nThe campus itself provides a range of stores, including dining options, clothing stores, and even groceries, making it self-sufficient. A central park serves as a gathering place for the community, maintained and safe thanks to the collective effort of its residents.",
            "After living in my Stockbridge neighborhood for 10 years, I can share some insights. Initially, moving from Riverdale was tough. I missed my old friends and cried, but my parents believed this move offered better housing, a superior high school, and a safer environment. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends and some rivals, though I never truly connected with most neighbors except Mr. Glen and his family, and briefly Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish their friendship. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage ceremony with my family. It was a joyous occasion, inspiring me to envision my own future wedding and providing my future wife with a life of comfort and luxury. I even caught Mr. Glen's wife's wedding accessory during the celebration! While I didn't catch the bouquet, we danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she's thriving. \n\nThe neighborhood's layout is complex, but with a GPS, I'm exploring it more. My explorations have led me to spend time with friends Kason and Curtis, whom I've shared countless hours of video games and joyful moments with. I also find solace in the local park, where I connect with nature, find peace, and practice my balance and swordsmanship skills. The basketball and tennis courts, although underutilized lately, serve as a reminder of my childhood passion for tennis, nurtured by my father and my best friend under the guidance of Mr. Graves.  \n\nLooking back, this neighborhood has been a source of joy and countless memories. I anticipate many more fulfilling experiences in the years to come.",
            "My neighborhood, located close to my college, is a mix of old apartment buildings, a few affordable restaurants and bars, and a couple of newer, more expensive complexes. While the neighborhood has a predominantly student and lower-income population, there's a noticeable presence of children due to a nearby elementary school. Despite some quirks, like the air freshener unit placed near a door notorious for weed smoking, I find the area generally pleasant. The older buildings, though somewhat outdated, often boast renovated interiors. The newer complexes, while modern, feel cheaply built and overpriced, taking advantage of their proximity to campus.  \n\nThe area has its share of inexpensive eats, including a budget-friendly eatery that serves food on paper plates. There's also a gas station, known for being a less desirable workplace. However, recent city improvements have revitalized the neighborhood with a wider sidewalk, grassy medians, and a more appealing aesthetic.\n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees, providing a sense of seclusion. The adjacent street, 43rd, is less appealing with dilapidated sidewalks and run-down buildings.  While crime has been reported in both my street and the adjacent one, I find the convenience and affordability of my location outweigh the negatives.  The proximity to the university and easy access to transportation are definite pluses.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses.  Every unit shares a distinctive yellow paint job, white porches, and green metal roofs.  While not everyone knows each other, a strong sense of community exists, with neighbors often gathering in driveways for casual conversations while their children play. This peaceful atmosphere feels like a throwback to simpler times, especially compared to our fast-paced, technology-driven world.  \n\nSurrounded by fields, trees, and expansive skies, the neighborhood offers a tranquil setting.  However, this season, we've experienced the unsettling reality of tornado warnings, culminating in a recent siren alert that forced us to seek shelter. I huddled in my bathtub with my youngest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog remained anxious and barking in the living room.  \n\nThe storm brought heavy hail, which melted instantly upon impact with the hot pavement, leaving a steamy residue in its wake.  As the clouds parted, a majestic double rainbow appeared, prompting me to capture its beauty with my camera.\n\nLife quickly returned to normal after the storm, with children and mothers resuming their outdoor routines.  I feel fortunate to have found this friendly community, particularly as a recent transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I enjoy the local Southern accents and the unique charm of our two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments, despite their outward uniformity.  \n\nBeyond our homes, a large field and a pond provide a haven for wildlife, including deer and a melodious bullfrog.  This idyllic setting, just forty minutes from Charlotte, feels like a small village, complete with the sounds of roosters crowing and a nearby donkey braying in the evenings.  I consider myself truly lucky to have discovered this hidden gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. Making friends initially was tough, but I connected with two neighbors who, though they've since moved, remain in my memories. Most original residents are still here. The neighborhood is typical of many American suburbs, featuring mostly two-story houses. Weekends and warm days often bring the sound of children playing outdoors. It's generally quiet, except for the occasional playful sounds. I've always felt safe and secure here; I've never encountered any issues with neighbors and packages have never been stolen from my porch.  \n\nThere's a park just a short walk away, filled with memories of basketball, football, and baseball games with neighborhood friends. While I have a few less-pleasant memories there too, the good times far outweigh the bad. Now, I visit the park mainly to spend time with my younger cousins, who enjoy the swings and slides.  The park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of culinary options within a short radius. From Chinese and Indian to Mexican and Italian, there's something to satisfy every craving. While some people opt for food delivery services, local favorites include fast food restaurants and pizza places.  \n\nConvenience is a hallmark of the area, with dry cleaners, pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store all within easy reach. Even specialty stores cater to diverse needs, like an Indian-owned shop for those who enjoy home-cooked meals or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I'm happy to call this neighborhood home. Hearing about the troubles others face with their neighbors makes me appreciate how fortunate I am.",
            "My neighborhood is a small, unassuming town in South Carolina. While it might not stand out visually, it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry, earning the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is largely defined by its farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches dominating the landscape. \n\nHouses are scattered throughout the countryside, mostly two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, often set back from the road to accommodate farm activities.  The main town area features a single traffic light at the intersection of four roads, where the town's limited commercial establishments are concentrated.\n\nFood options are modest, with a Chinese takeout restaurant, a Mexican eatery, and a local burger chain. A pharmacy known for its Cherry Coca-Cola and a small grocery store, IGA, cater to residents' needs, although many choose to travel to a larger Walmart in a nearby town for more extensive shopping.  Dollar General, surprisingly, is the most popular store in town, offering a wide range of everyday items.\n\nOther businesses include a long-standing furniture store with delivery service, a pet grooming facility, and small doctor's and veterinary practices.  The town's elementary school serves students until fifth grade, after which they attend middle and high school in a neighboring town.  While lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a small recreational area to provide residents with more leisure options.\n\nLife in Johnston is quiet and unpretentious, lacking the amenities found in larger cities. There are no theaters, bowling alleys, or vibrant gathering places. However, its charm lies in its simplicity and close-knit community. It's a place you could easily drive through without noticing, but it holds a unique appeal for those who appreciate its rural tranquility.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood through a podcast about missing persons, which was surprising because the area was known for its high rent.  It seemed like everyone was struggling financially, and my friends and I had learned to be frugal, finding joy in secondhand treasures and embracing the scent of aging things. Despite the city's growth and its bustling streets, I found solace in the quiet of the nearby thrift stores.  Despite the constant influx of people and cars, the stores offered a peaceful refuge. The city's rapid development, reminiscent of New York, fostered a sense of individual independence. People largely kept to themselves, creating a space where privacy and quiet were valued.  \n\nUnlike the more social South, where concern for others was expected, this city offered anonymity. It was possible to maintain a sense of detachment, and the city seemed to roll on regardless. Yet, within this anonymity, a sense of community emerged. We, the residents, connected through shared needs, celebrations, and sorrows. \n\nLiving in a vast, impersonal apartment complex, I found comfort in the kindness of my neighbors. We looked after each other, shared meals, and offered support. They made this place feel less like a cold, impersonal space and more like a home. Despite the city's overwhelming scale, the connections I made with my neighbors gave me a sense of belonging and reminded me that I hadn't made a complete failure of my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowner's association presence.  The houses are uniformly well-maintained single-family homes with similar front yards featuring lawns, decorative stones, and short driveways.  \n\nThe roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA, and most houses are single-story, though some have two stories.  Unique to my neighborhood is the shared mailbox system, resembling apartments more than traditional single-family homes.\n\nLocated on the outskirts of a larger city, our area blends suburban and rural elements. We enjoy ample green space with community pools, gated and well-maintained, and walking trails for residents to enjoy.  The neighborhood is predominantly populated by retirees, creating a safe and friendly atmosphere.  \n\nWhile there are some middle-aged and young professionals, the city itself, despite its large population, retains a small-town vibe.  We have essential amenities, including a mall that caters to a variety of shopping needs, from high-end grocery stores to budget-friendly outlets.\n\nAlthough a short drive is required for major shopping, my neighborhood offers a safe, well-kept environment with convenient amenities and a strong sense of community.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, on the east side, is economically disadvantaged, characterized by low property values and residents with lower incomes. However, it's not unappealing; neighbors are friendly and crime, while slightly higher than other parts of town, remains generally low. There have been isolated incidents, including shootings and a homicide, but our family hasn't been directly affected beyond occasional porch thefts.\n\nThe town, like many in the US, has been deeply impacted by the opioid epidemic, resulting in several fentanyl overdose deaths. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available.\n\nDespite these challenges, the town offers positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff and a welcoming environment where he thrives despite having special needs. An active PTO fosters family involvement and educational progress.  \n\nThe school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, addressing the town's 20%+ poverty rate. No child or family faces stigma due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are reasonably priced.\n\nWhile city improvements like road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations have primarily benefited the central, west side, the east side, where I live, remains neglected, a source of concern for residents.\n\nOverall, I find joy in living here. The friendly people, excellent schools, convenient shopping options, and our comfortable home make it a place we've called home for over 16 years and wouldn't trade for anything else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is rich in history and culture. Situated on a hillside, it's filled with buildings that tell stories of the past. I live in a seven-story apartment building near a historic theater and a popular arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds, especially on warm summer evenings. A nearby park, though small for its location, provides a gathering space, and during winter, it becomes a temporary shelter for the homeless, who find warmth and security in their close proximity to a nearby community center offering essential services.  \n\nWhile Hilltop's historical architecture is impressive, what truly makes it special is its resilient community. Once notorious for gang violence, the neighborhood still bears the scars of its past, with stories passed down through generations. Despite its challenging reputation, residents work hard to maintain their community, taking pride in their surroundings. \n\nSome warn against walking alone in Hilltop after dark, a warning I believe stems from outdated perceptions and ingrained biases. Perhaps because of my own background, I feel accepted and safe here. Hilltop reflects the complexities of our nation, where racism and prejudice persist despite efforts towards inclusivity. \n\nHowever, Hilltop is more than just its history or its struggles. It's a place where I feel a sense of belonging. I've experienced kindness and generosity from its residents, who have offered me support and warmth when I needed it most. It's a neighborhood where people look out for each other, where strangers become friends, and where I feel truly alive.",
            "I reside in a small town in rural Michigan, nestled between farmland and tourist destinations.  Unlike larger cities, we lack chain stores like malls, Walmart, Target, or even restaurants like Applebee's.  Getting around requires driving, but the trade-off is living in a stunningly beautiful area surrounded by water. My town is bordered by both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering easy access to beaches.\n\nThe neighborhood embodies the classic small-town feel.  Houses are spaced out, each with its own unique character, ranging from updated and remodeled homes to older, more traditional ones. Many feature full basements visible from the street and older aluminum siding.  The streets are a vibrant mix of colorful houses, most with yards boasting trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even enclosures for animals.\n\nThe residents reflect the hardworking spirit of Middle America, raising or having raised families.  Children play freely in the streets, while adults are often seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. A strong sense of community prevails, with neighbors knowing each other and a clear distinction between those who belong and those who don't.\n\nA friendly atmosphere permeates the area.  Neighbors exchange waves and smiles, whether grilling outside or walking their dogs.  Lawns are well-maintained, reflecting a sense of pride and care.\n\nWhile not flashy, the neighborhood exudes a warmth and welcoming atmosphere, ideal for raising a family.  It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. The nearby presence of the sheriff's department, jail, health department, recycling center, and recreational facilities further contribute to its sense of security and convenience.\n\nThe sound of baseball games and small planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport add a unique charm to everyday life.  A local ice cream shop is within walking distance, and the downtown area is a short bike ride away.\n\nOverall, this small town offers a high quality of life, with its strong sense of community, beautiful surroundings, and convenient amenities."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones where businesses of all kinds thrive, including offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  There's a wide array of dining and shopping options, from large, established brands to trendy boutiques that line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet residential areas.  \n\nParks offer spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures. In a small area alone, you'll find a visible LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  While the neighborhood itself is diverse, the city as a whole has distinct ethnic enclaves like \"Korea Town\", \"China Town\", and \"Little Armenia\" just a few miles away, though traffic can make even short distances feel lengthy.\n\nWalking is uncommon in this city due to its vast size and heavy traffic.  Despite this, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings popping up everywhere, attracting new residents but also increasing concerns about overcrowding and traffic congestion.\n\nHowever, housing options are varied, ranging from single-family homes to duplexes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. My neighborhood reflects this diversity, with people of all ages, and while I remember a close-knit childhood community, today's neighborhood feels less connected.",
            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of a bygone era, a place where the American suburban dream still lingers. While most houses are single-family homes, some have been divided into two units while remaining attached. My own house, like many others, features a small front yard and driveway, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a time when this type of living was considered the epitome of success.\n\nDespite an underlying sense of disillusionment with the dream, the neighborhood retains a charm that draws people in. Although residents may not be as optimistic as they once were, and the upkeep of homes has declined, there are still signs of life and hope. Children play in the streets, a testament to their innocence and carefree spirit. The aging public school, a fixture for nearly nine decades, continues to inspire the younger generation while reminding older residents of their own youth. Even though churches are sparsely populated, basketball courts remain bustling with activity.\n\nThe neighborhood is a diverse mix of African American residents, with a notable Yemenite family owning the local supermarket, a rare sight in this predominantly black community. The wide streets are often filled with children playing football, their games paused only for passing cars. Generations of families have resided here, creating a strong sense of community and shared history.\n\nThe neighborhood has evolved over time, with once-popular businesses like the karate school transforming into a pharmacy, reflecting the shifting interests of the community. A small, independent movie theater, showing classic films at discounted prices, caters to a loyal older clientele while the younger generation gravitates towards newer releases.\n\nThere's a single expressway nearby, although the nearest entrance and exit are located in the neighboring town. A past petition to build a local exit was met with resistance from older residents who feared it would disrupt the neighborhood's character. Now, a new high school is being built, prompting a debate over a mascot that captures the essence of this unique community.",
            "This unassuming residential area, nestled behind a shopping strip, might not seem like a place where people would want to live.  Hidden behind an abandoned Whole Foods and seasonal hotels, a vibrant community thrives.  A row of apartment complexes, resembling carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls, line the street. While some complexes have a less-than-desirable reputation, others offer a hidden world unknown to most residents.  Across from these complexes stands a quiet community college satellite campus, where students arrive in the mornings, often yawning, for classes. Their presence sometimes causes frustration for commuters during busy days.\n\nThe road leads to a residential street with a park and a rehabilitation center. The center's cheerful atmosphere contrasts with the park's lively scene of children playing, dogs being walked, and teenagers skateboarding and socializing. A nearby strip mall provides everyday conveniences, including a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a frozen yogurt shop.  This neighborhood, a classic American scene, feels timeless and unchanged in its sleepy southern setting.",
            "As we drove past the endless cornfields, my companion, unfamiliar with rural landscapes, exclaimed, \"Where is everything?\"  I knew she'd be surprised by the vast emptiness.  Coming from a town where everything was within walking distance, she'd never seen such open spaces. I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.  \n\nOur journey continued down a country road leading to a quarry filled with water. Just past it was my quiet development, with mostly brick and stucco houses, each boasting at least half an acre of meticulously maintained land. Spring brought an abundance of colorful flowers alongside the trees that transformed with every season.  Luxury Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming after a wash, filled the driveways.\n\nMy Korean neighbor, always cheerful, greeted us with a wave. He spent his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his singing blending with the hum of his mower, a source of amusement for everyone. Despite his age, he remained a kind and genuine person with a rich past as a doctor.\n\nFinally, we reached my grey stucco home. Geese scattered in the side yard as our terrier chased after them.  A small stream flowed behind the house, connecting to the quarry, the sounds of bullfrogs, water, and distant cows filling the air.  A wooden bridge led to a wild, untouched oasis brimming with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood haven, a place for building forts, \"hunting\" (mostly chasing), and countless adventures with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinter brought a harsh beauty to our small town. The green yard transformed into a barren wilderness, the once vibrant trees now skeletal against the sky. But when snow fell, it blanketed everything in a magical silence. Snow angels and snowmen adorned the yard, remnants of playful battles between my sister and me. Snowballs became our weapons, and we built elaborate igloo-like forts to house them.  \n\nIn our own winter wonderland, we escaped into a world of make-believe, worries forgotten. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",
            "Portland, Oregon, embraces a unique spirit often described as \"weird.\" This isn't just a quirky slogan; it reflects a culture that celebrates individuality and unconventional lifestyles. While some see it as a nostalgic reminder of Portland's past, others view it as an invitation to embrace their own eccentricities. Despite the influx of new residents and ongoing gentrification, Portland retains its distinct charm. \n\n\"Weird\" doesn't mean blindly accepting everything, but rather embracing the unusual and unconventional. It's a city where you can find both modern conveniences and social challenges, just like any other. Portlanders enjoy yoga, trendy coffee shops, and professional pursuits, but they also appreciate the unexpected.  \n\nNeighborhoods like Southeast Portland offer a glimpse into this unique culture, with colorful houses, community gardens, and \"free boxes\" brimming with discarded treasures. This spirit of resourcefulness and sharing embodies the city's sense of community. \n\nPortland is a melting pot of diverse interests, from goat yoga to soccer matches. While it grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, which are common struggles in many cities, its residents remain dedicated to pursuing their passions and supporting each other.",
            "The mountains, always a constant presence to the north, serve as silent witnesses to the daily cycle of the sun. No matter how busy life gets, they remain steadfast, untouched by life's ups and downs.  On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, the mountains beckon me, offering solace and renewed strength.\n\nMy fascination with these mountains began when I first moved to this town for university. While the campus itself holds its own beauty, it's the mountains that truly capture my heart.  The town itself is charming, with cozy cafes perfect for late-night study sessions and a vibrant downtown area with historic architecture that pulsates with energy.  Yet, it's easy to escape the hustle and bustle and find tranquility in the more residential areas.  This unique blend of urban and suburban vibes creates a special atmosphere that invites exploration and makes it easy to create lasting memories, both joyful and melancholic.\n\nThe town's ponds, with their tranquil beauty, have also become a place for quiet reflection, sometimes during moments of existential crisis.  Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives made me contemplate my own purpose and place in the world.\n\nOne morning, while walking through the town, I found myself drawn northwards, towards the mountains.  As the sun rose, painting the sky in hues of blue and yellow, I was reminded of their enduring presence. Their majestic presence served as a powerful symbol of perseverance, urging me to keep moving forward.",
            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy thanks to its well-connected public transportation system.  As a predominantly urban area, it retains the quintessential New York City vibe.  Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, lining the streets. These businesses are highly popular among locals due to their high-quality products, competitive prices, and convenience.  \n\nWhile Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children, it boasts a strong Asian business presence.  There's also a recently renovated park offering a variety of amenities, including basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. This park reflects the city's diverse population. Housing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op/condominium apartments, with few large corporate buildings.  \n\nDespite its generally friendly residents, Bensonhurst can be noisy, with traffic often disrupting the peace. While generally safe, residents should exercise caution at night, as there have been incidents of bullying and theft.  Additionally, dog waste is a common issue, despite city ordinances, so visitors should be mindful of their surroundings.",
            "My neighborhood is characterized by steep hills, a lack of sidewalks, and a constant battle with the elements.  The most prominent feature is the \"work out hill,\" a steep incline favored by joggers.  The winding road, riddled with potholes, serves as the primary pathway for pedestrians.  Ancient telephone and electric wires, frequently damaged by storms and overgrown trees, create a patchwork appearance.  While the towering evergreen trees offer a lush backdrop, many residents endeavor to remove them to enhance ocean views.  As a result, houses are often constructed with elevated second stories boasting expansive windows to capture the breathtaking sunsets.  Despite the scenic beauty, the region experiences frequent overcast skies and precipitation, often shrouding the landscape in a damp haze.  Moss thrives in this environment, blanketing everything from roofs to vehicles.\n\nThe neighborhood is predominantly populated by retirees, with an abundance of dogs but a limited number of children.  Wild rabbits, a nuisance to gardeners, are a source of entertainment for local cats.  A variety of birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasional hawks and eagles, inhabit the area.  While the neighborhood lacks retail stores, residents can find a few seafood restaurants by venturing to the waterfront, where rocky shores offer a glimpse into the relatively narrow bay.",

During winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill. Our house, located at the corner, provides us with a clear view of neighborhood comings and goings, making us familiar with the usual vehicles. Any unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play bikes, typical of a suburban setting. As we work from home, we're often present and our family of four – myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen – is well-known by the community. We embrace outdoor activities, even in light rain, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with pleasant barbecue aromas. The sound of lawnmowers is a constant presence from March to October, as the neighborhood boasts many trees originally from a wooded area, providing ample shade but also leading to an annual leaf-raking and burning ritual. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a welcome sign of autumn. However, recent winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means we rarely use the front door unless someone visits, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and having the doors open allows me to feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays see a quiet atmosphere, with Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas bringing increased activity and visitors. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant, and if it weren't for the through-traffic, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is located in a high desert area characterized by its dusty landscape. It's a place where brown hues dominate the scenery, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating significant financial investment. While the neighborhood was initially spread out, recent developments have led to increased density, transforming it into something resembling a city. Despite these changes, the residents are generally friendly, although, like any urban environment, there are both positive and negative aspects. My immediate surroundings are populated by friendly elderly neighbors, making it a pleasant place to live. The local amenities primarily consist of chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. For a wider selection, one needs to travel elsewhere, as there aren't any upscale grocery stores like Whole Foods.\n\nConstruction appears to be the most prevalent industry in the city, possibly due to its ongoing development and abundance of undeveloped land. This expansion concerns me, as I prefer the current pace of change. Having previously lived in a big city, I'm content with the more relaxed atmosphere of the high desert. My full-time job is in construction, specializing in drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the aspects I appreciate most about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that require protection and support a variety of animals.  It's essential for residents to understand and respect these non-human inhabitants to ensure harmonious coexistence.\n\nMy family and I have adjusted well to living alongside wildlife. My children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, often spending time outdoors collecting specimens. Victorville offers several attractions, making it a suitable destination for families seeking a desert experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a highlight, providing a blend of activities and entertainment.\n\nFor a contrasting experience, visitors can explore the nearby snow-capped mountains in Wrightwood and enjoy winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum offers insights into the region's natural history and culture, showcasing geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that chronicle the evolution of Victorville.",
            "Living on a college campus, my \"neighborhood\" is unique. While others might picture traditional houses and yards, my community is the dormitory and the surrounding campus.  Like any neighborhood, there are different types of dwellings here: apartments, houses, and dorm buildings. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging 20 residents per building. Houses, mostly rented by alumni, are less common, typically offering 2-4 bedrooms. The most prevalent housing is dorm-style, with shared rooms accommodating hundreds of students.\n\nMy campus boasts a diverse population, reflecting the school's commitment to inclusion.  Professionals often live in the houses, newer students in dorms, and older students gravitate towards apartments. The neighborhood's rich tapestry is best experienced firsthand.\n\nConveniently, the campus is self-sufficient, offering a variety of stores, including dining options, unique school merchandise, and grocery stores.  A central park provides a recreational space for everyone, maintained by the community and free from crime.",
            "Over the past ten years, I've called this neighborhood home and have experienced both good and bad times. Moving here from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough; I missed my old friends and felt sad leaving. However, my parents believed this move was for the best, offering better housing, schools, and a safer environment. It took time to adjust, but I made new friends and even some enemies in school.\n\nI didn't really connect with most of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and briefly Dennis. They became like family to me, and I cherish our bond. I fondly remember attending their remarriage ceremony, which was a joyous occasion. It inspired me to dream of my own future wedding and providing a wonderful life for my future wife. I even caught Mr. Glen's wife's wedding favor!\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but with a GPS, I'm exploring it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, enjoying video games and making the most of our youth. I also find solace in nature, often visiting the park to relax and find peace. I practice my balance with sticks and sometimes bring my wooden sword for practice.\n\nWhile I haven't played in a while, the neighborhood also has basketball and tennis courts, which remind me of my childhood playing tennis with my dad and my best friend, Mr. Graves. We had so much fun, even though he pushed us hard.\n\nLooking back, this neighborhood has been filled with both fun and memorable experiences. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college, which is one of the main reasons I enjoy living there. While it's primarily composed of apartment buildings, there are a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. The area is predominantly populated by college students and lower-income individuals due to the relatively inexpensive housing.  There's a noticeable presence of children due to a nearby elementary school. \n\nAlthough I don't know my neighbors well, they tend to smoke marijuana frequently, leading to the building management installing an air freshener unit near their entrance, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The surrounding buildings are generally older in appearance, though some may have renovated interiors. \n\nNew apartment complexes have been built down the street, but I dislike them because of their poor construction quality despite their high rent prices, which I believe is exploitative.  There's a cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and primarily uses microwaved meals. Across from it is a gas station with a reportedly poor work environment.\n\nFortunately, recent city funding has resulted in road improvements, including a wider sidewalk, grassy medians, and a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. My apartment building is nestled amongst trees, although a few have been removed, leaving behind stumps.\n\nBehind my complex, a tree line separates it from another set of apartments located on 43rd Street. While 43rd Street has sidewalks in a state of disrepair and buildings that appear run-down, it's also heavily wooded, possibly to conceal their appearance.  A nearby apartment complex on 43rd Street has been associated with most of the area's crime, although other complexes have also experienced issues.  \n\nDespite these drawbacks, I find my neighborhood livable due to its affordability, proximity to amenities, and easy access to the university via walking and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood consists of identical duplex homes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced apart to resemble individual houses. Their uniform appearance, with yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, creates a distinctive visual. While not everyone knows each other, there's a strong sense of community, with neighbors gathering in the evenings for casual conversation while children play. This tranquil atmosphere offers a welcome escape from the constant demands of modern technology.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields, trees, and open skies, enhancing its idyllic charm. However, this idyllic setting was recently disrupted by a tornado warning, prompting residents to seek shelter. Thankfully, the storm passed without major damage, leaving behind a trail of melted hail and a spectacular double rainbow.\n\nDespite the weather event, life quickly returned to normal, with families enjoying the outdoors and the friendly atmosphere. As a recent transplant from New Hampshire, I've found this Southern community to be incredibly welcoming, with its unique charm and friendly residents. \n\nAlthough all the apartments appear alike from the outside, they vary in size internally. I enjoy exploring the nearby fields and pond, where I've observed wildlife and experienced the sounds of nature. Located just forty minutes from Charlotte, this neighborhood offers a peaceful retreat with a strong sense of community. The daily sounds of roosters crowing and a nearby donkey braying add to its unique character. Finding this special place has been a true blessing.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade.  Making friends initially was tough, but I eventually became close to two neighbors, though they've since moved away. Most of the original residents are still here, and the neighborhood feels like a typical American suburb. It's filled with two-story houses, and kids are often playing outside on weekends or warm days. It's generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with anyone in the neighborhood; people tend to keep to themselves unless help is needed.\n\nI've ordered many packages online without any problems, and I feel confident in the trustworthiness of my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk away, filled with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. While I have a bad memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the good memories outweigh the bad. Now, I go there mostly to spend time with my cousins' younger children who enjoy the swings and slides. The park evokes strong feelings of nostalgia.\n\nThe neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. While many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, popular options include fast food chains, readily available in most suburbs, and numerous pizza places. There are also plenty of essential stores, such as dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest favorite. Some stores even cater to specific cultures, like an Indian-owned store for those seeking home-cooked or ready-made Indian meals.\n\nOverall, I love my neighborhood. Reading about the negative experiences others have with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Johnston, a small town in South Carolina, is unassuming but plays a significant role in agriculture, earning the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is primarily rural, featuring vast expanses of farmland devoted to peach orchards and cattle ranching. Houses are generally spaced apart, often two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, set back from the roads to accommodate agricultural use. The town center, characterized by a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, houses the only stores in town.  These include a few fast food options like Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's burger joint.  A small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Residents primarily shop for groceries at the local IGA, although many travel to Walmart in a nearby town for a wider selection. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a diverse range of everyday items. \n\nOther businesses include Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing furniture store with delivery service, and Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming facility.  Medical services are provided by a small doctor's practice and a vet clinic.  Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger residents, but older students attend schools in a neighboring town.  While lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance community life.  Despite the limited entertainment options, Johnston offers a quiet and friendly atmosphere.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood after hearing a podcast about missing people. It was surprising because rent in the area was very high, over a thousand dollars per month, and I'd never heard of any disappearances there, nor had any of my friends.  Life can be tough, with many of my friends struggling financially. Despite the cost of living, we've learned to be resourceful, finding joy in secondhand treasures and embracing a more minimalist lifestyle.  However, the presence of thrift stores is inescapable; the scent of aged paper and mothballs permeates everything, a reminder of the everyday struggles of adulthood.  Walking distance from my apartment, there are three thrift stores, each offering a unique experience: two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. While downtown is bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores offer a peaceful respite, a tranquil haven from the urban noise. It's a perfect place to lose oneself for an afternoon.\n\nOver time, the city has become increasingly crowded, with more cars and people filling its streets. It's experiencing rapid development, becoming a major hub for e-commerce and delivery. This growth brings challenges, reminiscent of New York City, where people tend to keep to themselves, focused on their individual pursuits.  There's a sense of independence here, a freedom to be alone without judgment.  Unlike the South, where social expectations are more pronounced, people in this city respect each other's privacy.\n\nDespite the anonymity, a sense of community has emerged within our building.  We have a pianist next door, amateur singers upstairs, and we come together for birthdays, funerals, and to offer support when needed. It's a place where I feel a sense of belonging, surrounded by kind and considerate neighbors. I try my best to be a good neighbor, cleaning up after myself, sharing food, and helping out when I can.  It's heartwarming to see them reciprocate, bringing me mail and simply enjoying each other's company.  While living in a large, impersonal modernist complex, it's the connections I've made with my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't made a complete mess of my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowners association (HOA) presence.  The uniformity is evident in the well-maintained single-family homes, all featuring similar landscaping with short driveways, small trees, and two-car garages.  The roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA, and there are no potholes. While most houses are single-story, some are two-story. \n\nInstead of individual mailboxes, there are communal mailboxes located at the end of the street, accessed with a key. Large package lockers are also available.\n\nMy house is on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban life with a rural feel. This translates to ample space for amenities like community pools, walking trails, and even opportunities for jogging within the neighborhood itself. \n\nThe community is primarily made up of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment. While a small number of middle-aged and young professionals also reside here, the majority are senior citizens who look out for each other. \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly large but retains a small-town atmosphere.  It offers most essential amenities, including a single mall with a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets.  A 15-minute drive takes me to these shopping options. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical of suburban life, offering a balance of community amenities and convenient access to city conveniences.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. While my neighborhood on the east side of town faces economic challenges with lower property values and a predominantly low-income population, it's not unappealing. Residents are generally friendly and welcoming. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other areas, they remain relatively low. There have been a few isolated incidents of violence nearby, including shootings and a homicide, impacting our community, as our neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting incident. Despite these challenges, crime hasn't directly affected our family beyond the occasional petty theft. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with several lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available to combat this issue.\n\nDespite these difficulties, our town has many positives. My son attends an excellent elementary school with supportive staff who foster a positive environment where he thrives, even with his special needs. The active PTO organizes numerous events to engage families and promote educational progress. Recognizing the high poverty rate (over 20%), the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school also ensures affordability by keeping fees, supplies, and field trip costs reasonable, treating all families with respect regardless of their financial situation.\n\nThe City Council has made efforts to improve the town's appearance, focusing primarily on the central area and the west side where most businesses and traffic are located.  This neglect of the east side, where I live, is a source of frustration for many residents.\n\nOverall, I find living in this town enjoyable. The friendly community, excellent schools, convenient shopping options, and comfortable home make it a place we call home. After 16 years, we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is a vibrant place steeped in history. It's nestled on a hill, boasting buildings with rich stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building opposite an old theater, and a short walk away is a popular arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. During June and July, especially on weekends, lines often form outside.  A short distance away is the local park, surprisingly spacious for its location.  The park is enclosed by concrete walls with steep steps. During winter, homeless individuals seek refuge along the sidewalk and steps, forming organized rows to stay warm amidst the occasional downpours.  Their proximity to a nearby family center, which provides essential services like bathing and showering, is a crucial advantage.  While Hilltop's historical architecture and scenic views are appealing, I cherish its people and their resilience. \n\nHilltop has a past marked by gang violence, and although decades have passed, the echoes of those times linger.  Stories passed down through generations remind us of the government's past attempts to quell the unrest. Despite its tough reputation, the community strives to maintain its environment and takes pride in its neighborhood.  Despite warnings against venturing out at night if you're white, I believe this advice reflects outdated perceptions rooted in prejudice. Perhaps my appearance or my understanding of social realities allows me to be accepted as one of them. Hilltop resonates with my own awareness of the persistent issues of racism and social conditioning that plague our nation.\n\nHilltop is my home. I feel a sense of belonging and safety walking its streets, even at night. Its residents have shown kindness and generosity, offering help more readily than harm. From laundromat owners extending their hours to strangers offering comfort on cold days, Hilltop has fostered a sense of community and support. The residents of Hilltop are a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure, adapt, and overcome adversity.",
            "I reside in a charming small town in rural Michigan, nestled between farmland and picturesque tourist destinations. While lacking the amenities of larger cities like malls, chain stores, or even popular restaurants, my community is surrounded by the beauty of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering easy access to beaches. \n\nThe neighborhood exudes a classic small-town feel. Houses, a mix of older and updated styles, are spaced out, reflecting a sense of community and individuality. Most homes have full basements and yards, often featuring gardens, playsets, or even animals. \n\nThe residents are hardworking individuals, many raising families in this safe and peaceful environment. Children play freely, neighbors greet each other warmly, and well-maintained lawns contribute to a sense of pride.\n\nAlthough not ostentatious, the neighborhood offers a strong sense of belonging and security, a place where people can thrive.  Essential services like the sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center are within walking distance. Nearby recreational facilities include baseball fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. The proximity to these amenities, coupled with the friendly atmosphere and sense of community, makes this a truly special place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones where businesses of all kinds thrive, including offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  There's a wide array of dining and shopping options, from large, established brands to trendy boutiques that line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet residential areas.  \n\nParks offer spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures. In a small area alone, you'll find a visible LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  While the neighborhood itself is diverse, the city as a whole has distinct ethnic enclaves like \"Korea Town\", \"China Town\", and \"Little Armenia\" just a few miles away, though traffic can make even short distances feel lengthy.\n\nWalking is uncommon in this city due to its vast size and heavy traffic.  Despite this, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings popping up everywhere, attracting new residents but also increasing concerns about overcrowding and traffic congestion.\n\nHowever, housing options are varied, ranging from single-family homes to duplexes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. My neighborhood reflects this diversity, with people of all ages, and while I remember a close-knit childhood community, today's neighborhood feels less connected.",
            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of a bygone era, a place where the American suburban dream still lingers. While most houses are single-family homes, some have been divided into two units while remaining attached. My own house, like many others, features a small front yard and driveway, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a time when this type of living was considered the epitome of success.\n\nDespite an underlying sense of disillusionment with the dream, the neighborhood retains a charm that draws people in. Although residents may not be as optimistic as they once were, and the upkeep of homes has declined, there are still signs of life and hope. Children play in the streets, a testament to their innocence and carefree spirit. The aging public school, a fixture for nearly nine decades, continues to inspire the younger generation while reminding older residents of their own youth. Even though churches are sparsely populated, basketball courts remain bustling with activity.\n\nThe neighborhood is a diverse mix of African American residents, with a notable Yemenite family owning the local supermarket, a rare sight in this predominantly black community. The wide streets are often filled with children playing football, their games paused only for passing cars. Generations of families have resided here, creating a strong sense of community and shared history.\n\nThe neighborhood has evolved over time, with once-popular businesses like the karate school transforming into a pharmacy, reflecting the shifting interests of the community. A small, independent movie theater, showing classic films at discounted prices, caters to a loyal older clientele while the younger generation gravitates towards newer releases.\n\nThere's a single expressway nearby, although the nearest entrance and exit are located in the neighboring town. A past petition to build a local exit was met with resistance from older residents who feared it would disrupt the neighborhood's character. Now, a new high school is being built, prompting a debate over a mascot that captures the essence of this unique community.",
            "This unassuming residential area, nestled behind a shopping strip, might not seem like a place where people would want to live.  Hidden behind an abandoned Whole Foods and seasonal hotels, a vibrant community thrives.  A row of apartment complexes, resembling carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls, line the street. While some complexes have a less-than-desirable reputation, others offer a hidden world unknown to most residents.  Across from these complexes stands a quiet community college satellite campus, where students arrive in the mornings, often yawning, for classes. Their presence sometimes causes frustration for commuters during busy days.\n\nThe road leads to a residential street with a park and a rehabilitation center. The center's cheerful atmosphere contrasts with the park's lively scene of children playing, dogs being walked, and teenagers skateboarding and socializing. A nearby strip mall provides everyday conveniences, including a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a frozen yogurt shop.  This neighborhood, a classic American scene, feels timeless and unchanged in its sleepy southern setting.",
            "As we drove past the endless cornfields, my companion, unfamiliar with rural landscapes, exclaimed, \"Where is everything?\"  I knew she'd be surprised by the vast emptiness.  Coming from a town where everything was within walking distance, she'd never seen such open spaces. I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.  \n\nOur journey continued down a country road leading to a quarry filled with water. Just past it was my quiet development, with mostly brick and stucco houses, each boasting at least half an acre of meticulously maintained land. Spring brought an abundance of colorful flowers alongside the trees that transformed with every season.  Luxury Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming after a wash, filled the driveways.\n\nMy Korean neighbor, always cheerful, greeted us with a wave. He spent his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his singing blending with the hum of his mower, a source of amusement for everyone. Despite his age, he remained a kind and genuine person with a rich past as a doctor.\n\nFinally, we reached my grey stucco home. Geese scattered in the side yard as our terrier chased after them.  A small stream flowed behind the house, connecting to the quarry, the sounds of bullfrogs, water, and distant cows filling the air.  A wooden bridge led to a wild, untouched oasis brimming with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood haven, a place for building forts, \"hunting\" (mostly chasing), and countless adventures with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinter brought a harsh beauty to our small town. The green yard transformed into a barren wilderness, the once vibrant trees now skeletal against the sky. But when snow fell, it blanketed everything in a magical silence. Snow angels and snowmen adorned the yard, remnants of playful battles between my sister and me. Snowballs became our weapons, and we built elaborate igloo-like forts to house them.  \n\nIn our own winter wonderland, we escaped into a world of make-believe, worries forgotten. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",

While some see it as a nostalgic reminder of Portland's past, others view it as an invitation to embrace their own eccentricities. Despite the influx of new residents and ongoing gentrification, Portland retains its distinct charm. \n\n\"Weird\" doesn't mean blindly accepting everything, but rather embracing the unusual and unconventional. It's a city where you can find both modern conveniences and social challenges, just like any other. Portlanders enjoy yoga, trendy coffee shops, and professional pursuits, but they also appreciate the unexpected.  \n\nNeighborhoods like Southeast Portland offer a glimpse into this unique culture, with colorful houses, community gardens, and \"free boxes\" brimming with discarded treasures. This spirit of resourcefulness and sharing embodies the city's sense of community. \n\nPortland is a melting pot of diverse interests, from goat yoga to soccer matches. While it grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, which are common struggles in many cities, its residents remain dedicated to pursuing their passions and supporting each other.",
            "The mountains, always a constant presence to the north, serve as silent witnesses to the daily cycle of the sun. No matter how busy life gets, they remain steadfast, untouched by life's ups and downs.  On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, the mountains beckon me, offering solace and renewed strength.\n\nMy fascination with these mountains began when I first moved to this town for university. While the campus itself holds its own beauty, it's the mountains that truly capture my heart.  The town itself is charming, with cozy cafes perfect for late-night study sessions and a vibrant downtown area with historic architecture that pulsates with energy.  Yet, it's easy to escape the hustle and bustle and find tranquility in the more residential areas.  This unique blend of urban and suburban vibes creates a special atmosphere that invites exploration and makes it easy to create lasting memories, both joyful and melancholic.\n\nThe town's ponds, with their tranquil beauty, have also become a place for quiet reflection, sometimes during moments of existential crisis.  Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives made me contemplate my own purpose and place in the world.\n\nOne morning, while walking through the town, I found myself drawn northwards, towards the mountains.  As the sun rose, painting the sky in hues of blue and yellow, I was reminded of their enduring presence. Their majestic presence served as a powerful symbol of perseverance, urging me to keep moving forward.",
            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy thanks to its well-connected public transportation system.  As a predominantly urban area, it retains the quintessential New York City vibe.  Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, lining the streets. These businesses are highly popular among locals due to their high-quality products, competitive prices, and convenience.  \n\nWhile Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children, it boasts a strong Asian business presence.  There's also a recently renovated park offering a variety of amenities, including basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. This park reflects the city's diverse population. Housing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op/condominium apartments, with few large corporate buildings.  \n\nDespite its generally friendly residents, Bensonhurst can be noisy, with traffic often disrupting the peace. While generally safe, residents should exercise caution at night, as there have been incidents of bullying and theft.  Additionally, dog waste is a common issue, despite city ordinances, so visitors should be mindful of their surroundings.",
            "My neighborhood is characterized by steep hills, a lack of sidewalks, and a constant battle with the elements.  The most prominent feature is the \"work out hill,\" a steep incline favored by joggers.  The winding road, riddled with potholes, serves as the primary pathway for pedestrians.  Ancient telephone and electric wires, frequently damaged by storms and overgrown trees, create a patchwork appearance.  While the towering evergreen trees offer a lush backdrop, many residents endeavor to remove them to enhance ocean views.  As a result, houses are often constructed with elevated second stories boasting expansive windows to capture the breathtaking sunsets.  Despite the scenic beauty, the region experiences frequent overcast skies and precipitation, often shrouding the landscape in a damp haze.  Moss thrives in this environment, blanketing everything from roofs to vehicles.\n\nThe neighborhood is predominantly populated by retirees, with an abundance of dogs but a limited number of children.  Wild rabbits, a nuisance to gardeners, are a source of entertainment for local cats.  A variety of birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasional hawks and eagles, inhabit the area.  While the neighborhood lacks retail stores, residents can find a few seafood restaurants by venturing to the waterfront, where rocky shores offer a glimpse into the relatively narrow bay.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Although our street serves as a connector between state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, it's generally a peaceful community.  The neighborhood has a low turnover rate, allowing me to become acquainted with most residents. Residents primarily engage in everyday activities like yard work. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill. Our house, located at the corner, provides us with a clear view of neighborhood comings and goings, making us familiar with the usual vehicles. Any unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play bikes, typical of a suburban setting. As we work from home, we're often present and our family of four – myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen – is well-known by the community. We embrace outdoor activities, even in light rain, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with pleasant barbecue aromas. The sound of lawnmowers is a constant presence from March to October, as the neighborhood boasts many trees originally from a wooded area, providing ample shade but also leading to an annual leaf-raking and burning ritual. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a welcome sign of autumn. However, recent winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means we rarely use the front door unless someone visits, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and having the doors open allows me to feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays see a quiet atmosphere, with Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas bringing increased activity and visitors. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant, and if it weren't for the through-traffic, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is located in a high desert area characterized by its dusty landscape. It's a place where brown hues dominate the scenery, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating significant financial investment. While the neighborhood was initially spread out, recent developments have led to increased density, transforming it into something resembling a city. Despite these changes, the residents are generally friendly, although, like any urban environment, there are both positive and negative aspects. My immediate surroundings are populated by friendly elderly neighbors, making it a pleasant place to live. The local amenities primarily consist of chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. For a wider selection, one needs to travel elsewhere, as there aren't any upscale grocery stores like Whole Foods.\n\nConstruction appears to be the most prevalent industry in the city, possibly due to its ongoing development and abundance of undeveloped land. This expansion concerns me, as I prefer the current pace of change. Having previously lived in a big city, I'm content with the more relaxed atmosphere of the high desert. My full-time job is in construction, specializing in drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the aspects I appreciate most about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that require protection and support a variety of animals.  It's essential for residents to understand and respect these non-human inhabitants to ensure harmonious coexistence.\n\nMy family and I have adjusted well to living alongside wildlife. My children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, often spending time outdoors collecting specimens. Victorville offers several attractions, making it a suitable destination for families seeking a desert experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a highlight, providing a blend of activities and entertainment.\n\nFor a contrasting experience, visitors can explore the nearby snow-capped mountains in Wrightwood and enjoy winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum offers insights into the region's natural history and culture, showcasing geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that chronicle the evolution of Victorville.",
            "Living on a college campus, my \"neighborhood\" is unique. While others might picture traditional houses and yards, my community is the dormitory and the surrounding campus.  Like any neighborhood, there are different types of dwellings here: apartments, houses, and dorm buildings. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging 20 residents per building. Houses, mostly rented by alumni, are less common, typically offering 2-4 bedrooms. The most prevalent housing is dorm-style, with shared rooms accommodating hundreds of students.\n\nMy campus boasts a diverse population, reflecting the school's commitment to inclusion.  Professionals often live in the houses, newer students in dorms, and older students gravitate towards apartments. The neighborhood's rich tapestry is best experienced firsthand.\n\nConveniently, the campus is self-sufficient, offering a variety of stores, including dining options, unique school merchandise, and grocery stores.  A central park provides a recreational space for everyone, maintained by the community and free from crime.",
            "Over the past ten years, I've called this neighborhood home and have experienced both good and bad times. Moving here from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough; I missed my old friends and felt sad leaving. However, my parents believed this move was for the best, offering better housing, schools, and a safer environment. It took time to adjust, but I made new friends and even some enemies in school.\n\nI didn't really connect with most of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and briefly Dennis. They became like family to me, and I cherish our bond. I fondly remember attending their remarriage ceremony, which was a joyous occasion. It inspired me to dream of my own future wedding and providing a wonderful life for my future wife. I even caught Mr. Glen's wife's wedding favor!\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but with a GPS, I'm exploring it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, enjoying video games and making the most of our youth. I also find solace in nature, often visiting the park to relax and find peace. I practice my balance with sticks and sometimes bring my wooden sword for practice.\n\nWhile I haven't played in a while, the neighborhood also has basketball and tennis courts, which remind me of my childhood playing tennis with my dad and my best friend, Mr. Graves. We had so much fun, even though he pushed us hard.\n\nLooking back, this neighborhood has been filled with both fun and memorable experiences. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college, which is one of the main reasons I enjoy living there. While it's primarily composed of apartment buildings, there are a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. The area is predominantly populated by college students and lower-income individuals due to the relatively inexpensive housing.  There's a noticeable presence of children due to a nearby elementary school. \n\nAlthough I don't know my neighbors well, they tend to smoke marijuana frequently, leading to the building management installing an air freshener unit near their entrance, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The surrounding buildings are generally older in appearance, though some may have renovated interiors. \n\nNew apartment complexes have been built down the street, but I dislike them because of their poor construction quality despite their high rent prices, which I believe is exploitative.  There's a cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and primarily uses microwaved meals. Across from it is a gas station with a reportedly poor work environment.\n\nFortunately, recent city funding has resulted in road improvements, including a wider sidewalk, grassy medians, and a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. My apartment building is nestled amongst trees, although a few have been removed, leaving behind stumps.\n\nBehind my complex, a tree line separates it from another set of apartments located on 43rd Street. While 43rd Street has sidewalks in a state of disrepair and buildings that appear run-down, it's also heavily wooded, possibly to conceal their appearance.  A nearby apartment complex on 43rd Street has been associated with most of the area's crime, although other complexes have also experienced issues.  \n\nDespite these drawbacks, I find my neighborhood livable due to its affordability, proximity to amenities, and easy access to the university via walking and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood consists of identical duplex homes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced apart to resemble individual houses. Their uniform appearance, with yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, creates a distinctive visual. While not everyone knows each other, there's a strong sense of community, with neighbors gathering in the evenings for casual conversation while children play. This tranquil atmosphere offers a welcome escape from the constant demands of modern technology.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields, trees, and open skies, enhancing its idyllic charm. However, this idyllic setting was recently disrupted by a tornado warning, prompting residents to seek shelter. Thankfully, the storm passed without major damage, leaving behind a trail of melted hail and a spectacular double rainbow.\n\nDespite the weather event, life quickly returned to normal, with families enjoying the outdoors and the friendly atmosphere. As a recent transplant from New Hampshire, I've found this Southern community to be incredibly welcoming, with its unique charm and friendly residents. \n\nAlthough all the apartments appear alike from the outside, they vary in size internally. I enjoy exploring the nearby fields and pond, where I've observed wildlife and experienced the sounds of nature. Located just forty minutes from Charlotte, this neighborhood offers a peaceful retreat with a strong sense of community. The daily sounds of roosters crowing and a nearby donkey braying add to its unique character. Finding this special place has been a true blessing.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade.  Making friends initially was tough, but I eventually became close to two neighbors, though they've since moved away. Most of the original residents are still here, and the neighborhood feels like a typical American suburb. It's filled with two-story houses, and kids are often playing outside on weekends or warm days. It's generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with anyone in the neighborhood; people tend to keep to themselves unless help is needed.\n\nI've ordered many packages online without any problems, and I feel confident in the trustworthiness of my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk away, filled with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. While I have a bad memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the good memories outweigh the bad. Now, I go there mostly to spend time with my cousins' younger children who enjoy the swings and slides. The park evokes strong feelings of nostalgia.\n\nThe neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. While many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, popular options include fast food chains, readily available in most suburbs, and numerous pizza places. There are also plenty of essential stores, such as dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest favorite. Some stores even cater to specific cultures, like an Indian-owned store for those seeking home-cooked or ready-made Indian meals.\n\nOverall, I love my neighborhood. Reading about the negative experiences others have with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Johnston, a small town in South Carolina, is unassuming but plays a significant role in agriculture, earning the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is primarily rural, featuring vast expanses of farmland devoted to peach orchards and cattle ranching. Houses are generally spaced apart, often two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, set back from the roads to accommodate agricultural use. The town center, characterized by a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, houses the only stores in town.  These include a few fast food options like Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's burger joint.  A small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Residents primarily shop for groceries at the local IGA, although many travel to Walmart in a nearby town for a wider selection. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a diverse range of everyday items. \n\nOther businesses include Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing furniture store with delivery service, and Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming facility.  Medical services are provided by a small doctor's practice and a vet clinic.  Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger residents, but older students attend schools in a neighboring town.  While lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance community life.  Despite the limited entertainment options, Johnston offers a quiet and friendly atmosphere.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood after hearing a podcast about missing people. It was surprising because rent in the area was very high, over a thousand dollars per month, and I'd never heard of any disappearances there, nor had any of my friends.  Life can be tough, with many of my friends struggling financially. Despite the cost of living, we've learned to be resourceful, finding joy in secondhand treasures and embracing a more minimalist lifestyle.  However, the presence of thrift stores is inescapable; the scent of aged paper and mothballs permeates everything, a reminder of the everyday struggles of adulthood.  Walking distance from my apartment, there are three thrift stores, each offering a unique experience: two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. While downtown is bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores offer a peaceful respite, a tranquil haven from the urban noise. It's a perfect place to lose oneself for an afternoon.\n\nOver time, the city has become increasingly crowded, with more cars and people filling its streets. It's experiencing rapid development, becoming a major hub for e-commerce and delivery. This growth brings challenges, reminiscent of New York City, where people tend to keep to themselves, focused on their individual pursuits.  There's a sense of independence here, a freedom to be alone without judgment.  Unlike the South, where social expectations are more pronounced, people in this city respect each other's privacy.\n\nDespite the anonymity, a sense of community has emerged within our building.  We have a pianist next door, amateur singers upstairs, and we come together for birthdays, funerals, and to offer support when needed. It's a place where I feel a sense of belonging, surrounded by kind and considerate neighbors. I try my best to be a good neighbor, cleaning up after myself, sharing food, and helping out when I can.  It's heartwarming to see them reciprocate, bringing me mail and simply enjoying each other's company.  While living in a large, impersonal modernist complex, it's the connections I've made with my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't made a complete mess of my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowners association (HOA) presence.  The uniformity is evident in the well-maintained single-family homes, all featuring similar landscaping with short driveways, small trees, and two-car garages.  The roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA, and there are no potholes. While most houses are single-story, some are two-story. \n\nInstead of individual mailboxes, there are communal mailboxes located at the end of the street, accessed with a key. Large package lockers are also available.\n\nMy house is on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban life with a rural feel. This translates to ample space for amenities like community pools, walking trails, and even opportunities for jogging within the neighborhood itself. \n\nThe community is primarily made up of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment. While a small number of middle-aged and young professionals also reside here, the majority are senior citizens who look out for each other. \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly large but retains a small-town atmosphere.  It offers most essential amenities, including a single mall with a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets.  A 15-minute drive takes me to these shopping options. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical of suburban life, offering a balance of community amenities and convenient access to city conveniences.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. While my neighborhood on the east side of town faces economic challenges with lower property values and a predominantly low-income population, it's not unappealing. Residents are generally friendly and welcoming. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other areas, they remain relatively low. There have been a few isolated incidents of violence nearby, including shootings and a homicide, impacting our community, as our neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting incident. Despite these challenges, crime hasn't directly affected our family beyond the occasional petty theft. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with several lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available to combat this issue.\n\nDespite these difficulties, our town has many positives. My son attends an excellent elementary school with supportive staff who foster a positive environment where he thrives, even with his special needs. The active PTO organizes numerous events to engage families and promote educational progress. Recognizing the high poverty rate (over 20%), the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school also ensures affordability by keeping fees, supplies, and field trip costs reasonable, treating all families with respect regardless of their financial situation.\n\nThe City Council has made efforts to improve the town's appearance, focusing primarily on the central area and the west side where most businesses and traffic are located.  This neglect of the east side, where I live, is a source of frustration for many residents.\n\nOverall, I find living in this town enjoyable. The friendly community, excellent schools, convenient shopping options, and comfortable home make it a place we call home. After 16 years, we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is a vibrant place steeped in history. It's nestled on a hill, boasting buildings with rich stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building opposite an old theater, and a short walk away is a popular arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. During June and July, especially on weekends, lines often form outside.  A short distance away is the local park, surprisingly spacious for its location.  The park is enclosed by concrete walls with steep steps. During winter, homeless individuals seek refuge along the sidewalk and steps, forming organized rows to stay warm amidst the occasional downpours.  Their proximity to a nearby family center, which provides essential services like bathing and showering, is a crucial advantage.  While Hilltop's historical architecture and scenic views are appealing, I cherish its people and their resilience. \n\nHilltop has a past marked by gang violence, and although decades have passed, the echoes of those times linger.  Stories passed down through generations remind us of the government's past attempts to quell the unrest. Despite its tough reputation, the community strives to maintain its environment and takes pride in its neighborhood.  Despite warnings against venturing out at night if you're white, I believe this advice reflects outdated perceptions rooted in prejudice. Perhaps my appearance or my understanding of social realities allows me to be accepted as one of them. Hilltop resonates with my own awareness of the persistent issues of racism and social conditioning that plague our nation.\n\nHilltop is my home. I feel a sense of belonging and safety walking its streets, even at night. Its residents have shown kindness and generosity, offering help more readily than harm. From laundromat owners extending their hours to strangers offering comfort on cold days, Hilltop has fostered a sense of community and support. The residents of Hilltop are a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure, adapt, and overcome adversity.",
            "I reside in a charming small town in rural Michigan, nestled between farmland and picturesque tourist destinations. While lacking the amenities of larger cities like malls, chain stores, or even popular restaurants, my community is surrounded by the beauty of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering easy access to beaches. \n\nThe neighborhood exudes a classic small-town feel. Houses, a mix of older and updated styles, are spaced out, reflecting a sense of community and individuality. Most homes have full basements and yards, often featuring gardens, playsets, or even animals. \n\nThe residents are hardworking individuals, many raising families in this safe and peaceful environment. Children play freely, neighbors greet each other warmly, and well-maintained lawns contribute to a sense of pride.\n\nAlthough not ostentatious, the neighborhood offers a strong sense of belonging and security, a place where people can thrive.  Essential services like the sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center are within walking distance. Nearby recreational facilities include baseball fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. The proximity to these amenities, coupled with the friendly atmosphere and sense of community, makes this a truly special place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones where businesses of all kinds thrive, including offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  There's a wide array of dining and shopping options, from large, established brands to trendy boutiques that line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet residential areas.  \n\nParks offer spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures. In a small area alone, you'll find a visible LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  While the neighborhood itself is diverse, the city as a whole has distinct ethnic enclaves like \"Korea Town\", \"China Town\", and \"Little Armenia\" just a few miles away, though traffic can make even short distances feel lengthy.\n\nWalking is uncommon in this city due to its vast size and heavy traffic.  Despite this, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings popping up everywhere, attracting new residents but also increasing concerns about overcrowding and traffic congestion.\n\nHowever, housing options are varied, ranging from single-family homes to duplexes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. My neighborhood reflects this diversity, with people of all ages, and while I remember a close-knit childhood community, today's neighborhood feels less connected.",
            "My neighborhood is a snapshot of a bygone era, a place where the American suburban dream still lingers. While most houses are single-family homes, some have been divided into two units while remaining attached. My own house, like many others, features a small front yard and driveway, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a time when this type of living was considered the epitome of success.\n\nDespite an underlying sense of disillusionment with the dream, the neighborhood retains a charm that draws people in. Although residents may not be as optimistic as they once were, and the upkeep of homes has declined, there are still signs of life and hope. Children play in the streets, a testament to their innocence and carefree spirit. The aging public school, a fixture for nearly nine decades, continues to inspire the younger generation while reminding older residents of their own youth. Even though churches are sparsely populated, basketball courts remain bustling with activity.\n\nThe neighborhood is a diverse mix of African American residents, with a notable Yemenite family owning the local supermarket, a rare sight in this predominantly black community. The wide streets are often filled with children playing football, their games paused only for passing cars. Generations of families have resided here, creating a strong sense of community and shared history.\n\nThe neighborhood has evolved over time, with once-popular businesses like the karate school transforming into a pharmacy, reflecting the shifting interests of the community. A small, independent movie theater, showing classic films at discounted prices, caters to a loyal older clientele while the younger generation gravitates towards newer releases.\n\nThere's a single expressway nearby, although the nearest entrance and exit are located in the neighboring town. A past petition to build a local exit was met with resistance from older residents who feared it would disrupt the neighborhood's character. Now, a new high school is being built, prompting a debate over a mascot that captures the essence of this unique community.",
            "This unassuming residential area, nestled behind a shopping strip, might not seem like a place where people would want to live.  Hidden behind an abandoned Whole Foods and seasonal hotels, a vibrant community thrives.  A row of apartment complexes, resembling carefully disassembled Russian nesting dolls, line the street. While some complexes have a less-than-desirable reputation, others offer a hidden world unknown to most residents.  Across from these complexes stands a quiet community college satellite campus, where students arrive in the mornings, often yawning, for classes. Their presence sometimes causes frustration for commuters during busy days.\n\nThe road leads to a residential street with a park and a rehabilitation center. The center's cheerful atmosphere contrasts with the park's lively scene of children playing, dogs being walked, and teenagers skateboarding and socializing. A nearby strip mall provides everyday conveniences, including a sushi restaurant, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, and a frozen yogurt shop.  This neighborhood, a classic American scene, feels timeless and unchanged in its sleepy southern setting.",
            "As we drove past the endless cornfields, my companion, unfamiliar with rural landscapes, exclaimed, \"Where is everything?\"  I knew she'd be surprised by the vast emptiness.  Coming from a town where everything was within walking distance, she'd never seen such open spaces. I shared stories of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I came from.  \n\nOur journey continued down a country road leading to a quarry filled with water. Just past it was my quiet development, with mostly brick and stucco houses, each boasting at least half an acre of meticulously maintained land. Spring brought an abundance of colorful flowers alongside the trees that transformed with every season.  Luxury Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming after a wash, filled the driveways.\n\nMy Korean neighbor, always cheerful, greeted us with a wave. He spent his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his singing blending with the hum of his mower, a source of amusement for everyone. Despite his age, he remained a kind and genuine person with a rich past as a doctor.\n\nFinally, we reached my grey stucco home. Geese scattered in the side yard as our terrier chased after them.  A small stream flowed behind the house, connecting to the quarry, the sounds of bullfrogs, water, and distant cows filling the air.  A wooden bridge led to a wild, untouched oasis brimming with trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood haven, a place for building forts, \"hunting\" (mostly chasing), and countless adventures with neighborhood friends.\n\nWinter brought a harsh beauty to our small town. The green yard transformed into a barren wilderness, the once vibrant trees now skeletal against the sky. But when snow fell, it blanketed everything in a magical silence. Snow angels and snowmen adorned the yard, remnants of playful battles between my sister and me. Snowballs became our weapons, and we built elaborate igloo-like forts to house them.  \n\nIn our own winter wonderland, we escaped into a world of make-believe, worries forgotten. We were just kids, carefree and full of life.",
            "Portland, Oregon, embraces a unique spirit often described as \"weird.\" This isn't just a quirky slogan; it reflects a culture that celebrates individuality and unconventional lifestyles. While some see it as a nostalgic reminder of Portland's past, others view it as an invitation to embrace their own eccentricities. Despite the influx of new residents and ongoing gentrification, Portland retains its distinct charm. \n\n\"Weird\" doesn't mean blindly accepting everything, but rather embracing the unusual and unconventional. It's a city where you can find both modern conveniences and social challenges, just like any other. Portlanders enjoy yoga, trendy coffee shops, and professional pursuits, but they also appreciate the unexpected.  \n\nNeighborhoods like Southeast Portland offer a glimpse into this unique culture, with colorful houses, community gardens, and \"free boxes\" brimming with discarded treasures. This spirit of resourcefulness and sharing embodies the city's sense of community. \n\nPortland is a melting pot of diverse interests, from goat yoga to soccer matches. While it grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, which are common struggles in many cities, its residents remain dedicated to pursuing their passions and supporting each other.",
            "The mountains, always a constant presence to the north, serve as silent witnesses to the daily cycle of the sun. No matter how busy life gets, they remain steadfast, untouched by life's ups and downs.  On days when stress and anxiety overwhelm me, the mountains beckon me, offering solace and renewed strength.\n\nMy fascination with these mountains began when I first moved to this town for university. While the campus itself holds its own beauty, it's the mountains that truly capture my heart.  The town itself is charming, with cozy cafes perfect for late-night study sessions and a vibrant downtown area with historic architecture that pulsates with energy.  Yet, it's easy to escape the hustle and bustle and find tranquility in the more residential areas.  This unique blend of urban and suburban vibes creates a special atmosphere that invites exploration and makes it easy to create lasting memories, both joyful and melancholic.\n\nThe town's ponds, with their tranquil beauty, have also become a place for quiet reflection, sometimes during moments of existential crisis.  Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives made me contemplate my own purpose and place in the world.\n\nOne morning, while walking through the town, I found myself drawn northwards, towards the mountains.  As the sun rose, painting the sky in hues of blue and yellow, I was reminded of their enduring presence. Their majestic presence served as a powerful symbol of perseverance, urging me to keep moving forward.",

Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in an abundance of Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, lining the streets. These businesses are highly popular among locals due to their high-quality products, competitive prices, and convenience.  \n\nWhile Bensonhurst is diverse, with immigrants and their children, it boasts a strong Asian business presence.  There's also a recently renovated park offering a variety of amenities, including basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. This park reflects the city's diverse population. Housing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op/condominium apartments, with few large corporate buildings.  \n\nDespite its generally friendly residents, Bensonhurst can be noisy, with traffic often disrupting the peace. While generally safe, residents should exercise caution at night, as there have been incidents of bullying and theft.  Additionally, dog waste is a common issue, despite city ordinances, so visitors should be mindful of their surroundings.",
            "My neighborhood is characterized by steep hills, a lack of sidewalks, and a constant battle with the elements.  The most prominent feature is the \"work out hill,\" a steep incline favored by joggers.  The winding road, riddled with potholes, serves as the primary pathway for pedestrians.  Ancient telephone and electric wires, frequently damaged by storms and overgrown trees, create a patchwork appearance.  While the towering evergreen trees offer a lush backdrop, many residents endeavor to remove them to enhance ocean views.  As a result, houses are often constructed with elevated second stories boasting expansive windows to capture the breathtaking sunsets.  Despite the scenic beauty, the region experiences frequent overcast skies and precipitation, often shrouding the landscape in a damp haze.  Moss thrives in this environment, blanketing everything from roofs to vehicles.\n\nThe neighborhood is predominantly populated by retirees, with an abundance of dogs but a limited number of children.  Wild rabbits, a nuisance to gardeners, are a source of entertainment for local cats.  A variety of birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasional hawks and eagles, inhabit the area.  While the neighborhood lacks retail stores, residents can find a few seafood restaurants by venturing to the waterfront, where rocky shores offer a glimpse into the relatively narrow bay.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Although our street serves as a connector between state highways, resulting in more traffic than I prefer, it's generally a peaceful community.  The neighborhood has a low turnover rate, allowing me to become acquainted with most residents. Residents primarily engage in everyday activities like yard work. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill. Our house, located at the corner, provides us with a clear view of neighborhood comings and goings, making us familiar with the usual vehicles. Any unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play bikes, typical of a suburban setting. As we work from home, we're often present and our family of four – myself, my wife, and our daughters aged eleven and fourteen – is well-known by the community. We embrace outdoor activities, even in light rain, and often grill on our back deck, filling the air with pleasant barbecue aromas. The sound of lawnmowers is a constant presence from March to October, as the neighborhood boasts many trees originally from a wooded area, providing ample shade but also leading to an annual leaf-raking and burning ritual. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a welcome sign of autumn. However, recent winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means we rarely use the front door unless someone visits, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and having the doors open allows me to feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays see a quiet atmosphere, with Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas bringing increased activity and visitors. Overall, I find our neighborhood pleasant, and if it weren't for the through-traffic, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is located in a high desert area characterized by its dusty landscape. It's a place where brown hues dominate the scenery, and well-maintained lawns are a rarity, indicating significant financial investment. While the neighborhood was initially spread out, recent developments have led to increased density, transforming it into something resembling a city. Despite these changes, the residents are generally friendly, although, like any urban environment, there are both positive and negative aspects. My immediate surroundings are populated by friendly elderly neighbors, making it a pleasant place to live. The local amenities primarily consist of chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. For a wider selection, one needs to travel elsewhere, as there aren't any upscale grocery stores like Whole Foods.\n\nConstruction appears to be the most prevalent industry in the city, possibly due to its ongoing development and abundance of undeveloped land. This expansion concerns me, as I prefer the current pace of change. Having previously lived in a big city, I'm content with the more relaxed atmosphere of the high desert. My full-time job is in construction, specializing in drywall and T-bar installation.\n\nOne of the aspects I appreciate most about my home is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that require protection and support a variety of animals.  It's essential for residents to understand and respect these non-human inhabitants to ensure harmonious coexistence.\n\nMy family and I have adjusted well to living alongside wildlife. My children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, often spending time outdoors collecting specimens. Victorville offers several attractions, making it a suitable destination for families seeking a desert experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a highlight, providing a blend of activities and entertainment.\n\nFor a contrasting experience, visitors can explore the nearby snow-capped mountains in Wrightwood and enjoy winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum offers insights into the region's natural history and culture, showcasing geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that chronicle the evolution of Victorville.",
            "Living on a college campus, my \"neighborhood\" is unique. While others might picture traditional houses and yards, my community is the dormitory and the surrounding campus.  Like any neighborhood, there are different types of dwellings here: apartments, houses, and dorm buildings. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging 20 residents per building. Houses, mostly rented by alumni, are less common, typically offering 2-4 bedrooms. The most prevalent housing is dorm-style, with shared rooms accommodating hundreds of students.\n\nMy campus boasts a diverse population, reflecting the school's commitment to inclusion.  Professionals often live in the houses, newer students in dorms, and older students gravitate towards apartments. The neighborhood's rich tapestry is best experienced firsthand.\n\nConveniently, the campus is self-sufficient, offering a variety of stores, including dining options, unique school merchandise, and grocery stores.  A central park provides a recreational space for everyone, maintained by the community and free from crime.",
            "Over the past ten years, I've called this neighborhood home and have experienced both good and bad times. Moving here from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough; I missed my old friends and felt sad leaving. However, my parents believed this move was for the best, offering better housing, schools, and a safer environment. It took time to adjust, but I made new friends and even some enemies in school.\n\nI didn't really connect with most of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and briefly Dennis. They became like family to me, and I cherish our bond. I fondly remember attending their remarriage ceremony, which was a joyous occasion. It inspired me to dream of my own future wedding and providing a wonderful life for my future wife. I even caught Mr. Glen's wife's wedding favor!\n\nThe neighborhood can feel like a maze, but with a GPS, I'm exploring it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, enjoying video games and making the most of our youth. I also find solace in nature, often visiting the park to relax and find peace. I practice my balance with sticks and sometimes bring my wooden sword for practice.\n\nWhile I haven't played in a while, the neighborhood also has basketball and tennis courts, which remind me of my childhood playing tennis with my dad and my best friend, Mr. Graves. We had so much fun, even though he pushed us hard.\n\nLooking back, this neighborhood has been filled with both fun and memorable experiences. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college, which is one of the main reasons I enjoy living there. While it's primarily composed of apartment buildings, there are a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. The area is predominantly populated by college students and lower-income individuals due to the relatively inexpensive housing.  There's a noticeable presence of children due to a nearby elementary school. \n\nAlthough I don't know my neighbors well, they tend to smoke marijuana frequently, leading to the building management installing an air freshener unit near their entrance, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The surrounding buildings are generally older in appearance, though some may have renovated interiors. \n\nNew apartment complexes have been built down the street, but I dislike them because of their poor construction quality despite their high rent prices, which I believe is exploitative.  There's a cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and primarily uses microwaved meals. Across from it is a gas station with a reportedly poor work environment.\n\nFortunately, recent city funding has resulted in road improvements, including a wider sidewalk, grassy medians, and a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. My apartment building is nestled amongst trees, although a few have been removed, leaving behind stumps.\n\nBehind my complex, a tree line separates it from another set of apartments located on 43rd Street. While 43rd Street has sidewalks in a state of disrepair and buildings that appear run-down, it's also heavily wooded, possibly to conceal their appearance.  A nearby apartment complex on 43rd Street has been associated with most of the area's crime, although other complexes have also experienced issues.  \n\nDespite these drawbacks, I find my neighborhood livable due to its affordability, proximity to amenities, and easy access to the university via walking and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood consists of identical duplex homes arranged on a cul-de-sac, spaced apart to resemble individual houses. Their uniform appearance, with yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, creates a distinctive visual. While not everyone knows each other, there's a strong sense of community, with neighbors gathering in the evenings for casual conversation while children play. This tranquil atmosphere offers a welcome escape from the constant demands of modern technology.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields, trees, and open skies, enhancing its idyllic charm. However, this idyllic setting was recently disrupted by a tornado warning, prompting residents to seek shelter. Thankfully, the storm passed without major damage, leaving behind a trail of melted hail and a spectacular double rainbow.\n\nDespite the weather event, life quickly returned to normal, with families enjoying the outdoors and the friendly atmosphere. As a recent transplant from New Hampshire, I've found this Southern community to be incredibly welcoming, with its unique charm and friendly residents. \n\nAlthough all the apartments appear alike from the outside, they vary in size internally. I enjoy exploring the nearby fields and pond, where I've observed wildlife and experienced the sounds of nature. Located just forty minutes from Charlotte, this neighborhood offers a peaceful retreat with a strong sense of community. The daily sounds of roosters crowing and a nearby donkey braying add to its unique character. Finding this special place has been a true blessing.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade.  Making friends initially was tough, but I eventually became close to two neighbors, though they've since moved away. Most of the original residents are still here, and the neighborhood feels like a typical American suburb. It's filled with two-story houses, and kids are often playing outside on weekends or warm days. It's generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with anyone in the neighborhood; people tend to keep to themselves unless help is needed.\n\nI've ordered many packages online without any problems, and I feel confident in the trustworthiness of my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk away, filled with memories. I played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. While I have a bad memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, the good memories outweigh the bad. Now, I go there mostly to spend time with my cousins' younger children who enjoy the swings and slides. The park evokes strong feelings of nostalgia.\n\nThe neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a one-mile radius, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. While many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, popular options include fast food chains, readily available in most suburbs, and numerous pizza places. There are also plenty of essential stores, such as dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest favorite. Some stores even cater to specific cultures, like an Indian-owned store for those seeking home-cooked or ready-made Indian meals.\n\nOverall, I love my neighborhood. Reading about the negative experiences others have with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "Johnston, a small town in South Carolina, is unassuming but plays a significant role in agriculture, earning the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is primarily rural, featuring vast expanses of farmland devoted to peach orchards and cattle ranching. Houses are generally spaced apart, often two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, set back from the roads to accommodate agricultural use. The town center, characterized by a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, houses the only stores in town.  These include a few fast food options like Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's burger joint.  A small, family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. Residents primarily shop for groceries at the local IGA, although many travel to Walmart in a nearby town for a wider selection. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a diverse range of everyday items. \n\nOther businesses include Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing furniture store with delivery service, and Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming facility.  Medical services are provided by a small doctor's practice and a vet clinic.  Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger residents, but older students attend schools in a neighboring town.  While lacking traditional parks, the town is developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance community life.  Despite the limited entertainment options, Johnston offers a quiet and friendly atmosphere.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood after hearing a podcast about missing people. It was surprising because rent in the area was very high, over a thousand dollars per month, and I'd never heard of any disappearances there, nor had any of my friends.  Life can be tough, with many of my friends struggling financially. Despite the cost of living, we've learned to be resourceful, finding joy in secondhand treasures and embracing a more minimalist lifestyle.  However, the presence of thrift stores is inescapable; the scent of aged paper and mothballs permeates everything, a reminder of the everyday struggles of adulthood.  Walking distance from my apartment, there are three thrift stores, each offering a unique experience: two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. While downtown is bustling with cars and people, the thrift stores offer a peaceful respite, a tranquil haven from the urban noise. It's a perfect place to lose oneself for an afternoon.\n\nOver time, the city has become increasingly crowded, with more cars and people filling its streets. It's experiencing rapid development, becoming a major hub for e-commerce and delivery. This growth brings challenges, reminiscent of New York City, where people tend to keep to themselves, focused on their individual pursuits.  There's a sense of independence here, a freedom to be alone without judgment.  Unlike the South, where social expectations are more pronounced, people in this city respect each other's privacy.\n\nDespite the anonymity, a sense of community has emerged within our building.  We have a pianist next door, amateur singers upstairs, and we come together for birthdays, funerals, and to offer support when needed. It's a place where I feel a sense of belonging, surrounded by kind and considerate neighbors. I try my best to be a good neighbor, cleaning up after myself, sharing food, and helping out when I can.  It's heartwarming to see them reciprocate, bringing me mail and simply enjoying each other's company.  While living in a large, impersonal modernist complex, it's the connections I've made with my neighbors that make me feel like I haven't made a complete mess of my life.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowners association (HOA) presence.  The uniformity is evident in the well-maintained single-family homes, all featuring similar landscaping with short driveways, small trees, and two-car garages.  The roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA, and there are no potholes. While most houses are single-story, some are two-story. \n\nInstead of individual mailboxes, there are communal mailboxes located at the end of the street, accessed with a key. Large package lockers are also available.\n\nMy house is on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban life with a rural feel. This translates to ample space for amenities like community pools, walking trails, and even opportunities for jogging within the neighborhood itself. \n\nThe community is primarily made up of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment. While a small number of middle-aged and young professionals also reside here, the majority are senior citizens who look out for each other. \n\nThe city itself is surprisingly large but retains a small-town atmosphere.  It offers most essential amenities, including a single mall with a variety of stores, from high-end grocery stores to bargain outlets.  A 15-minute drive takes me to these shopping options. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical of suburban life, offering a balance of community amenities and convenient access to city conveniences.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. While my neighborhood on the east side of town faces economic challenges with lower property values and a predominantly low-income population, it's not unappealing. Residents are generally friendly and welcoming. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other areas, they remain relatively low. There have been a few isolated incidents of violence nearby, including shootings and a homicide, impacting our community, as our neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting incident. Despite these challenges, crime hasn't directly affected our family beyond the occasional petty theft. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with several lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, resources like addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training are available to combat this issue.\n\nDespite these difficulties, our town has many positives. My son attends an excellent elementary school with supportive staff who foster a positive environment where he thrives, even with his special needs. The active PTO organizes numerous events to engage families and promote educational progress. Recognizing the high poverty rate (over 20%), the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. The school also ensures affordability by keeping fees, supplies, and field trip costs reasonable, treating all families with respect regardless of their financial situation.\n\nThe City Council has made efforts to improve the town's appearance, focusing primarily on the central area and the west side where most businesses and traffic are located.  This neglect of the east side, where I live, is a source of frustration for many residents.\n\nOverall, I find living in this town enjoyable. The friendly community, excellent schools, convenient shopping options, and comfortable home make it a place we call home. After 16 years, we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is a vibrant place steeped in history. It's nestled on a hill, boasting buildings with rich stories to tell. I live in a seven-story apartment building opposite an old theater, and a short walk away is a popular arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. During June and July, especially on weekends, lines often form outside.  A short distance away is the local park, surprisingly spacious for its location.  The park is enclosed by concrete walls with steep steps. During winter, homeless individuals seek refuge along the sidewalk and steps, forming organized rows to stay warm amidst the occasional downpours.  Their proximity to a nearby family center, which provides essential services like bathing and showering, is a crucial advantage.  While Hilltop's historical architecture and scenic views are appealing, I cherish its people and their resilience. \n\nHilltop has a past marked by gang violence, and although decades have passed, the echoes of those times linger.  Stories passed down through generations remind us of the government's past attempts to quell the unrest. Despite its tough reputation, the community strives to maintain its environment and takes pride in its neighborhood.  Despite warnings against venturing out at night if you're white, I believe this advice reflects outdated perceptions rooted in prejudice. Perhaps my appearance or my understanding of social realities allows me to be accepted as one of them. Hilltop resonates with my own awareness of the persistent issues of racism and social conditioning that plague our nation.\n\nHilltop is my home. I feel a sense of belonging and safety walking its streets, even at night. Its residents have shown kindness and generosity, offering help more readily than harm. From laundromat owners extending their hours to strangers offering comfort on cold days, Hilltop has fostered a sense of community and support. The residents of Hilltop are a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure, adapt, and overcome adversity.",
            "I reside in a charming small town in rural Michigan, nestled between farmland and picturesque tourist destinations. While lacking the amenities of larger cities like malls, chain stores, or even popular restaurants, my community is surrounded by the beauty of Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, offering easy access to beaches. \n\nThe neighborhood exudes a classic small-town feel. Houses, a mix of older and updated styles, are spaced out, reflecting a sense of community and individuality. Most homes have full basements and yards, often featuring gardens, playsets, or even animals. \n\nThe residents are hardworking individuals, many raising families in this safe and peaceful environment. Children play freely, neighbors greet each other warmly, and well-maintained lawns contribute to a sense of pride.\n\nAlthough not ostentatious, the neighborhood offers a strong sense of belonging and security, a place where people can thrive.  Essential services like the sheriff's department, health department, and recycling center are within walking distance. Nearby recreational facilities include baseball fields, a small airport, and a local ice cream shop. The proximity to these amenities, coupled with the friendly atmosphere and sense of community, makes this a truly special place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood in a bustling city is incredibly diverse, with residential areas scattered among commercial zones filled with offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  From well-known chains to trendy boutiques, there's no shortage of shopping or dining options. Parks provide green spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish residents, and a sizable population of former Soviet immigrants. While the city boasts ethnic enclaves like Koreatown and Chinatown, these are often separated by considerable distances due to heavy traffic.  Traffic congestion is a major issue, with even short distances taking hours to cover during rush hour, making walking impractical for most residents.  \n\nDespite the influx of new apartment buildings, there's a variety of housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment complexes.

            "My neighborhood is a blend of traditional suburban homes, with some divided into two units while remaining attached. While it evokes a sense of nostalgia for the American dream of suburban living, there's a sense that this dream is fading. However, the neighborhood still holds onto that dream, with residents maintaining their homes and yards, albeit not as meticulously as in the past. Children still play with carefree abandon, and the local school, a fixture for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire hope for the future. \n\nThough churches are sparse and mostly empty, basketball courts remain lively.  Despite their differences in appearance, the homes share a similar feeling. The neighborhood is predominantly African American, with a notable Yemeni family owning the local supermarket.  Generations of families have lived here, fostering a strong sense of community.  \n\nThe neighborhood has seen its share of changes, with a karate school transforming into a pharmacy. A small movie theater, showing older films, caters to the older residents while younger people prefer newer releases.  A single expressway runs near the town, but residents, particularly the elders, opposed plans for an exit, fearing it would disrupt the neighborhood's character.  The community is currently debating a mascot for a new high school, with a unique blend of modern and traditional elements being considered.",

            "She questioned the vastness of the landscape as we drove past endless cornfields stretching towards the horizon. I knew she'd be surprised by the openness, having grown up in a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away. This was the stark contrast to her life, a world dominated by sprawling fields.  I shared stories of my childhood in rural Ohio, helping her understand the landscape and my roots.\n\nTurning onto a two-lane country road, we reached a quarry now filled with water. Just past it lay the small development where I live. The houses, predominantly brick and stucco, each occupy at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. Spring bursts with colorful blooms alongside the changing hues of the midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars lined the driveways, reflecting the midday sun after a thorough cleaning.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was tending to his lawn, his friendly face and cheerful singing audible above the hum of his John Deere mower. He is a beloved figure, despite his aging and occasional witticisms fading with time. His past as a doctor adds a unique layer to his character.  He blends seamlessly with the grass and his mower, a constant presence in the neighborhood.\n\nMy home is marked by a side yard bustling with geese and our playful terrier. Behind the house, a small stream winds its way to the quarry, its gentle sound accompanied by the croaking of bullfrogs and the distant \"moo\" of farm animals.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis, a haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood sanctuary, filled with tree forts, imaginary hunts, and endless opportunities for friendship with neighborhood kids.\n\nThe winters in our small town can be harsh, but they possess a unique beauty. The vibrant green turns into a stark wilderness, trees stripped bare, yet breathtaking in their simplicity. Snowfall transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland, adorned with snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I, though often at odds, found solace in snowball fights and constructing elaborate igloo-like forts, wielding branches as weapons.  In this winter wonderland, our world shrunk to the realm of make-believe, a time of pure childhood joy and carefree laughter.",
            "Portland, Oregon's identity is deeply tied to its \"weird\" culture.  This isn't just a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era; it's an invitation to embrace the city's unique blend of creativity and unconventional subcultures. Despite increasing gentrification and a booming population, Portland retains its quirky spirit. \"Weird\" in Portland means accepting the unusual and challenging norms, while still acknowledging the realities of modern life, including consumerism and its challenges. \n\nPortland is a tapestry of diverse individuals and experiences. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, professionals, and everyone in between. Perhaps what defines \"weird\" in Portland is a lighter approach to life, an appreciation for the unexpected, and a willingness to embrace the unconventional. The city's neighborhoods often feature colorful houses, vibrant gardens, and \"free boxes\" – makeshift treasure troves filled with discarded but potentially valuable items.\n\nThis spirit of discovery and resourcefulness is a hallmark of Portland.  However, Portland also grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, stemming from both mental health challenges and societal shortcomings. The city's commitment to social services attracts those in need, but the system struggles to meet the demands.  \n\nUltimately, Portland is a city of contradictions, where the acceptance of the unusual coexists with the realities of hardship. It's a place where people chase their dreams, find solace in community, and embrace the magic hidden in the everyday.",
            "The mountains, always present to the north, have been a constant in my life. No matter how busy I get, they stand unwavering, a reminder of something bigger than myself. On my toughest days, they call to me, offering solace and strength. I first fell in love with them when I moved to this town for college. While the university itself is beautiful, with its own unique charm, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.  \n\nThe town is a blend of suburban tranquility and urban energy. Quaint cafes, historic downtown, and bustling streets create a vibrant atmosphere. Yet, just a short distance away, the peaceful suburbs return, offering a sense of calm. This unique juxtaposition makes the town captivating.\n\nIt's a place where countless memories are made, both joyous and painful. I've shared laughter with friends in the park, celebrated movie nights, and experienced moments of deep reflection by the ponds. These serene waters have also been a witness to my emotional struggles, especially during late-night existential crises.\n\nOne morning, after a particularly difficult time, I found myself walking north, drawn to the mountains. As the sun rose, illuminating the palm trees and painting the sky, I realized I was heading towards them. Their majestic presence filled me with a sense of purpose and perseverance.",
            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy thanks to its excellent public transportation links. As a quintessential urban neighborhood, you'll feel right at home in the bustling city atmosphere. Bensonhurst has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades, resulting in a vibrant Asian business scene. You'll find Asian-owned stores, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, on almost every block. These businesses are popular with both locals and newcomers due to their high-quality goods, competitive prices, and convenience.  \n\nBeyond its Asian heritage, Bensonhurst is a diverse neighborhood with a mix of immigrants, first- and second-generation Americans. While many businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a recently renovated park offering amenities like basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op or condominium apartments. While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood can be quite noisy, with loud cars a common occurrence. \n\nWhile generally safe, Bensonhurst does have its share of challenges. Petty crime, such as package theft, can occur, and there are instances of unpredictable behavior.  \n\nAnother noticeable issue is a lack of adherence to leash laws, resulting in dog waste being frequently found on sidewalks.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill, with limited sidewalks and roads that are in need of repair. The area is prone to storms, which damage the power lines, giving them a patchwork appearance. Many evergreen trees surround the neighborhood, but residents dislike them because they obstruct views of the ocean. This is why houses are built high up on the hill with large second stories to maximize the view. The sunsets are stunning, with the water reflecting the orange sky. However, the area is often overcast and damp, resulting in a constant layer of moss on surfaces. \n\nThe neighborhood is primarily populated by older adults, with more dogs than children.  Wild rabbits are a common sight, causing problems for gardeners but delighting local cats.  Various birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles, inhabit the area. There are no stores in the immediate vicinity, but a few seafood restaurants are located at the waterfront, along with rocky shores perfect for throwing stones. The bay is narrow, allowing for clear views of the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Southern town in Tennessee. Situated on a connecting street between two state highways, our street experiences more traffic than I prefer. However, aside from that, it's a peaceful and familiar community.  \n\nThe neighborhood is relatively stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing me to become acquainted with most of my neighbors.  \n\nDaily life revolves around typical suburban activities like yard work and household chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our street.  \n\nOur house, located at the corner, provides a clear view of the neighborhood's comings and goings. We are familiar with the usual vehicles and readily notice any unfamiliar ones. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on bikes, creating a typical suburban atmosphere.  \n\nAs a family of four – myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen – we work from home, spending much of our time outdoors, even in the rain. We frequently barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant aroma.  \n\nThe neighborhood is characterized by its abundance of trees, remnants of its wooded past, offering ample shade but requiring regular leaf removal in the fall.  \n\nThe lack of significant winters lately has extended the feeling of fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means we rarely use the front door, except when someone knocks, which is infrequent. \n\nWorking on my truck or other projects in the garage, with the doors open, allows me to feel more connected to the neighborhood.  \n\nHolidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with visiting relatives filling the neighborhood with extra cars, particularly during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas.  \n\nOverall, I enjoy living here. My only wish is that our street wasn't a throughway.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the high desert, characterized by its expansive stretches of dirt. The landscape is predominantly brown, and maintaining a lawn requires significant financial investment. While the neighborhood was once sparsely populated, recent years have witnessed substantial development, resembling a burgeoning city. Despite the changes, the community remains friendly, although, like any urban area, it has its share of both positive and negative aspects. I reside in a predominantly senior-friendly neighborhood.  \n\nThe local stores consist mainly of chain establishments like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale options, one needs to travel elsewhere. Construction appears to be the most prevalent industry in the city, likely due to the abundant undeveloped land. This ongoing development raises concerns as I prefer the current state of affairs. Having previously lived in a big city, I have no desire to return.\n\nMy full-time job is in construction, specializing in drywall and T-bar installation.  One of the things I appreciate about living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain have fostered distinct ecosystems that deserve protection. It's important for residents to understand and coexist peacefully with the local fauna. My family and I have successfully adapted to sharing our environment with wildlife. \n\nWhile Victorville offers some attractions, it's particularly appealing for families seeking a different kind of experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair provides a unique blend of entertainment and activities.  A trip to nearby Wrightwood allows visitors to enjoy snow-covered mountains and winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum offers insights into the region's natural history and culture, showcasing geological, paleontological, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "My neighborhood is unique because instead of a traditional residential area, it's the college campus where I live.  My dorm and its residents form my immediate community, while the broader campus extends my sense of neighborhood.  Despite this unconventional setting, my campus neighborhood shares similarities with typical neighborhoods. It has houses, people, shops, and even a park.\n\nThere are three main types of housing: apartments, regular houses, and dorms. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room with 4-6 rooms per floor, accommodating around 20 residents per building.  Houses are available for rent by anyone affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom setups. These are less common due to their size.  Dorms, the most prevalent housing type, accommodate hundreds of students, with two people sharing a room in most cases.\n\nMy school values diversity, which is reflected in the diverse residents of my neighborhood.  Faculty members often reside in the houses, newer students stay in dorms, and older students opt for apartments.\n\nThe campus is self-sufficient, boasting a variety of stores, including dining options, clothing outlets, and a grocery store.  A single park provides a recreational space for everyone.  The park is well-maintained and safe due to the collective responsibility of the neighborhood.",
            "After living in this neighborhood for ten years, I've collected quite a few memories. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was heartbroken leaving my friends and family behind. However, my parents believed this new location offered better housing, schools, and opportunities.  \n\nIt took time to adjust, but I made new friends and even some rivals at school.  I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I cherish our relationship. I vividly remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage ceremony – it was a wonderful celebration filled with joy and dancing.  I even caught a piece of his wife's veil!  \n\nThis neighborhood can feel like a maze, but I'm gradually exploring it with the help of my GPS. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis, reminiscing about our shared love for video games and enjoying life to the fullest. I also find solace in spending time in the park, where nature calms my soul.  Sometimes, I'll practice my balance with sticks or even bring my wooden sword for some practice. \n\nThere's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played either sport in a while. Still, it's comforting to know they're there if I ever want to pick them up again. My dad, along with Mr. Graves, introduced me and my best friend to tennis when we were younger, and we had a blast learning and playing.\n\nLooking back, I realize I've had countless joyful moments in this neighborhood.  While I have many stories, these are the ones that stand out the most, and I'm excited for even more adventures to come!",
            "My neighborhood, located near my college, is a mix of apartment buildings, a few budget-friendly restaurants and bars, and a predominantly young or lower-income population. While some buildings are older and might have newer interiors, there are also newer complexes with questionable construction quality and high rents. Despite a few drawbacks like the presence of drug use and less-than-stellar establishments, I enjoy the convenience of living close to campus, with easy access to amenities, the university, and public transportation. There are some disreputable areas nearby, but overall, I find my neighborhood to be affordable and practical.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses.  Painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, they create a charming, nostalgic atmosphere. While not everyone is close, many residents frequently gather at the end of driveways, chatting as children play. This sense of community is a welcome respite from the digital world. The peaceful surroundings are enhanced by fields, trees, and open skies, offering a tranquil escape.  However, the idyllic peace was recently disrupted by severe weather. Tornado warnings became a reality when sirens blared, prompting residents to seek shelter. Despite the initial fear, the storm passed, leaving behind a remarkable sight: a double rainbow. Neighborhood life quickly resumed, with families enjoying the evening outdoors as if nothing had happened. Though I'm new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've found this friendly community to be a perfect fit.\n\nThe neighborhood consists of two-bedroom, two-bathroom duplexes, though their interiors vary. Despite their uniformity on the outside, some apartments are surprisingly small.  I enjoy exploring the nearby fields and pond, where I've spotted deer and heard the calls of a giant bullfrog.  The location, just forty minutes from Charlotte, offers the best of both worlds: a peaceful rural setting and easy access to city amenities.  The sounds of roosters crowing from nearby farms and the occasional braying of a donkey create a unique and charming atmosphere.  \n\nI feel fortunate to have discovered this special community.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade.  It took a while to make friends, but I eventually became close to a couple of guys who lived nearby. Although they've since moved away, those memories remain. \n\nThe neighborhood itself hasn't changed much; it's typical of many American suburbs with its two-story houses and quiet atmosphere.  You often hear kids playing outside on weekends or warm days. \n\nI feel safe here.  I've never experienced any problems with neighbors, and my packages have always been delivered safely.  It's a place where you're left to your own devices unless you need assistance. \n\nThere's a park just a short walk from my house, filled with memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with friends.  It also holds a less pleasant memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game. Despite that, the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I take my cousins' kids there, watching them enjoy the swings and slides brings back a wave of nostalgia.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a short distance, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants.  While delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, fast food chains and pizza places are abundant, as you'd expect in any suburb.  \n\nLocal stores cater to all needs, with dry cleaners, pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, and a popular Midwest grocery chain, Jewel-Osco.  Even the stores reflect the diversity, with an Indian-owned shop for those seeking authentic Indian groceries or ingredients.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. Hearing about the challenges others face with their neighbors makes me appreciate the sense of community I have.",
            "Johnston, a small town in South Carolina, is unassuming but plays a significant role in the state's agricultural industry. Known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" its landscape is primarily dominated by peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spaced apart, often with metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat, and are typically situated back from the road to accommodate agricultural use. The town center features a single intersection with a traffic light, where the few stores are located.  \n\nDining options are limited to Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain).  A pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola.  Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store, is small and expensive, leading many residents to travel to larger supermarkets in nearby towns. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday essentials. Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing family business, sells furniture and employs local movers. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service.\n\nHealthcare services are provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both located away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the town's youngest residents, but older students attend schools in the neighboring town. While there are no designated parks currently, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development.  The town lacks amenities such as movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston retains a charming, small-town atmosphere.",
            "I first learned about my apartment building from a podcast about missing people, which was surprising since it's in a pricey area.  I had never heard of any such incidents, nor had my friends.  Despite the high cost of living, we've learned to be resourceful, finding value in secondhand items and embracing a more minimalist lifestyle.  Life can be tough, and some of my friends struggle financially, but we find ways to cope.  This area is filled with thrift stores, offering a haven from the bustling city outside.  Downtown is constantly evolving, becoming more crowded with cars and people each year. It reminds me of New York City, where everyone is focused on their own goals and there's a sense of independence and privacy.  However, despite the anonymity, there's also a strong sense of community among my neighbors.  We look out for each other, celebrating milestones and offering support during difficult times.  Although I live in a large, impersonal building, my neighbors make me feel like I belong and haven't made a mistake by choosing this place to live.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical, cookie-cutter suburb with a strong homeowners' association (HOA) presence.  The homes are all well-maintained single-family houses, with similar front yards featuring grass, landscaping, short driveways, and occasional trees.  Every home has a two-car garage. The roads are in excellent condition, recently paved, and pothole-free. While mostly single-story, some two-story homes are also found in the development. The neighborhood features a centralized mailbox system, similar to apartments, with a shared key fob for each resident's mailbox and larger lockers for packages.\n\nLocated on the outskirts of the city, the neighborhood blends suburban living with a rural feel. This provides ample space for amenities like multiple community pools, gated and well-maintained, and walking trails for residents. Its size allows for ample exercise opportunities without needing to visit a park.  \n\nThe community is primarily composed of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment.  There's also a smaller population of middle-aged and young professionals.  The city itself is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town charm. It offers most necessary amenities, including a mall for shopping, though it's smaller in size.  \n\nWhile the neighborhood itself lacks immediate access to major stores, a 15-minute drive provides a variety of options, from upscale grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a pleasant suburban lifestyle with access to both community amenities and city conveniences.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is economically disadvantaged, with lower property values and residents primarily from low-income backgrounds. Despite this, it's a pleasant place to live. Neighbors are friendly and crime, though slightly higher than in other parts of town, remains generally low. While there have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, our family has thankfully remained untouched except for occasional minor thefts. \n\nThe town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, leading to several fentanyl-related deaths. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction treatment centers and Narcan training programs.\n\nDespite these challenges, my town boasts positive aspects. My son attends a fantastic elementary school with dedicated staff who foster a positive environment. He has thrived there, free from bullying, and enjoys learning. An active PTO organizes numerous events to engage families and promote education.  The school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students, ensuring no child goes hungry, and fees for supplies and field trips are affordable, regardless of a family's financial situation.\n\nWhile city improvements like road repaving and park renovations have primarily benefitted the central area and west side, the east side, where I live, has been largely overlooked, a source of frustration for residents. \n\nOverall, I appreciate living in this town. The friendly atmosphere, excellent schools, ample shopping options, and our comfortable home make it a place we call home after 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is steeped in history and culture. Situated on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with significant pasts. I live in a seven-story apartment building across from a historic theater, near a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds, especially during warm summer evenings. A short distance away is a sizable city park, enclosed by concrete with a series of stairs built into the wall. During winter, homeless individuals often set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, seeking warmth as the rain and occasional snow make conditions challenging. Their proximity to the park's center and the nearby family center, which offers showers and other resources, provides them with crucial support. \n\nWhile the neighborhood boasts historical beauty, its true charm lies in its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, carries the memories of its turbulent past. Despite ongoing challenges, the community works hard to maintain its streets and care for its residents. Although warnings exist against walking alone in the area after dark, I believe they stem from outdated prejudices. I, perhaps due to my own mixed heritage, feel a sense of belonging here. Hilltop has shown me kindness and acceptance, reminding me that genuine connection can transcend societal biases.\n\nI've experienced firsthand the warmth of this community, from strangers offering me a jacket to laundromat owners extending their hours to help me charge my phone. Even on the gloomiest nights, I've encountered individuals who offered me words of encouragement and support. Hilltop, with its complexities and challenges, is a place where I feel truly alive and at home.",
            "My home is in a small town in rural Michigan, transitioning from farmland to tourist destinations. While lacking big-city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, the beauty of my surroundings is undeniable. I live by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches readily accessible.  My neighborhood reflects the quintessential small-town charm. Houses aren't identical cookie-cutter structures; they are unique, older homes, some modernized and others preserving their original character. Many feature full, visible basements and aluminum siding, with a colorful variety of styles lining the streets. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines, playsets, gardens, or animal enclosures.  \n\nThe neighborhood embodies the spirit of hardworking, family-oriented individuals. Children play freely on the streets, while adults enjoy walks with their dogs, bike rides, and rollerblading. Neighbors maintain a strong sense of community, readily recognizing each other and engaging in friendly interactions.  \n\nLawns are well-kept, free of debris, with trimmed bushes and greenery. \n\nWhile not visually stunning, the neighborhood's true value lies in its sense of safety, tranquility, and family-friendliness.  It's a place where people feel comfortable and welcome.  \n\nWithin walking distance, we have essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center. Local recreational activities, including baseball fields and a small airport, add to the charm. A nearby ice cream shop and downtown area are also within reach.  The convenience of nearby amenities, like the park just eight blocks away, makes this a truly great place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood in a bustling city is incredibly diverse, with residential areas scattered among commercial zones filled with offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  From well-known chains to trendy boutiques, there's no shortage of shopping or dining options. Parks provide green spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish residents, and a sizable population of former Soviet immigrants. While the city boasts ethnic enclaves like Koreatown and Chinatown, these are often separated by considerable distances due to heavy traffic.  Traffic congestion is a major issue, with even short distances taking hours to cover during rush hour, making walking impractical for most residents.  \n\nDespite the influx of new apartment buildings, there's a variety of housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartment complexes.

            "My neighborhood is a blend of traditional suburban homes, with some divided into two units while remaining attached. While it evokes a sense of nostalgia for the American dream of suburban living, there's a sense that this dream is fading. However, the neighborhood still holds onto that dream, with residents maintaining their homes and yards, albeit not as meticulously as in the past. Children still play with carefree abandon, and the local school, a fixture for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire hope for the future. \n\nThough churches are sparse and mostly empty, basketball courts remain lively.  Despite their differences in appearance, the homes share a similar feeling. The neighborhood is predominantly African American, with a notable Yemeni family owning the local supermarket.  Generations of families have lived here, fostering a strong sense of community.  \n\nThe neighborhood has seen its share of changes, with a karate school transforming into a pharmacy. A small movie theater, showing older films, caters to the older residents while younger people prefer newer releases.  A single expressway runs near the town, but residents, particularly the elders, opposed plans for an exit, fearing it would disrupt the neighborhood's character.  The community is currently debating a mascot for a new high school, with a unique blend of modern and traditional elements being considered.",

            "She questioned the vastness of the landscape as we drove past endless cornfields stretching towards the horizon. I knew she'd be surprised by the openness, having grown up in a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away. This was the stark contrast to her life, a world dominated by sprawling fields.  I shared stories of my childhood in rural Ohio, helping her understand the landscape and my roots.\n\nTurning onto a two-lane country road, we reached a quarry now filled with water. Just past it lay the small development where I live. The houses, predominantly brick and stucco, each occupy at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. Spring bursts with colorful blooms alongside the changing hues of the midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars lined the driveways, reflecting the midday sun after a thorough cleaning.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was tending to his lawn, his friendly face and cheerful singing audible above the hum of his John Deere mower. He is a beloved figure, despite his aging and occasional witticisms fading with time. His past as a doctor adds a unique layer to his character.  He blends seamlessly with the grass and his mower, a constant presence in the neighborhood.\n\nMy home is marked by a side yard bustling with geese and our playful terrier. Behind the house, a small stream winds its way to the quarry, its gentle sound accompanied by the croaking of bullfrogs and the distant \"moo\" of farm animals.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis, a haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood sanctuary, filled with tree forts, imaginary hunts, and endless opportunities for friendship with neighborhood kids.\n\nThe winters in our small town can be harsh, but they possess a unique beauty. The vibrant green turns into a stark wilderness, trees stripped bare, yet breathtaking in their simplicity. Snowfall transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland, adorned with snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I, though often at odds, found solace in snowball fights and constructing elaborate igloo-like forts, wielding branches as weapons.  In this winter wonderland, our world shrunk to the realm of make-believe, a time of pure childhood joy and carefree laughter.",
            "Portland, Oregon's identity is deeply tied to its \"weird\" culture.  This isn't just a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era; it's an invitation to embrace the city's unique blend of creativity and unconventional subcultures. Despite increasing gentrification and a booming population, Portland retains its quirky spirit. \"Weird\" in Portland means accepting the unusual and challenging norms, while still acknowledging the realities of modern life, including consumerism and its challenges. \n\nPortland is a tapestry of diverse individuals and experiences. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, professionals, and everyone in between. Perhaps what defines \"weird\" in Portland is a lighter approach to life, an appreciation for the unexpected, and a willingness to embrace the unconventional. The city's neighborhoods often feature colorful houses, vibrant gardens, and \"free boxes\" – makeshift treasure troves filled with discarded but potentially valuable items.\n\nThis spirit of discovery and resourcefulness is a hallmark of Portland.  However, Portland also grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, stemming from both mental health challenges and societal shortcomings. The city's commitment to social services attracts those in need, but the system struggles to meet the demands.  \n\nUltimately, Portland is a city of contradictions, where the acceptance of the unusual coexists with the realities of hardship. It's a place where people chase their dreams, find solace in community, and embrace the magic hidden in the everyday.",
            "The mountains, always present to the north, have been a constant in my life. No matter how busy I get, they stand unwavering, a reminder of something bigger than myself. On my toughest days, they call to me, offering solace and strength. I first fell in love with them when I moved to this town for college. While the university itself is beautiful, with its own unique charm, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.  \n\nThe town is a blend of suburban tranquility and urban energy. Quaint cafes, historic downtown, and bustling streets create a vibrant atmosphere. Yet, just a short distance away, the peaceful suburbs return, offering a sense of calm. This unique juxtaposition makes the town captivating.\n\nIt's a place where countless memories are made, both joyous and painful. I've shared laughter with friends in the park, celebrated movie nights, and experienced moments of deep reflection by the ponds. These serene waters have also been a witness to my emotional struggles, especially during late-night existential crises.\n\nOne morning, after a particularly difficult time, I found myself walking north, drawn to the mountains. As the sun rose, illuminating the palm trees and painting the sky, I realized I was heading towards them. Their majestic presence filled me with a sense of purpose and perseverance.",
            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy thanks to its excellent public transportation links. As a quintessential urban neighborhood, you'll feel right at home in the bustling city atmosphere. Bensonhurst has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades, resulting in a vibrant Asian business scene. You'll find Asian-owned stores, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, on almost every block. These businesses are popular with both locals and newcomers due to their high-quality goods, competitive prices, and convenience.  \n\nBeyond its Asian heritage, Bensonhurst is a diverse neighborhood with a mix of immigrants, first- and second-generation Americans. While many businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a recently renovated park offering amenities like basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op or condominium apartments. While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood can be quite noisy, with loud cars a common occurrence. \n\nWhile generally safe, Bensonhurst does have its share of challenges. Petty crime, such as package theft, can occur, and there are instances of unpredictable behavior.  \n\nAnother noticeable issue is a lack of adherence to leash laws, resulting in dog waste being frequently found on sidewalks.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill, with limited sidewalks and roads that are in need of repair. The area is prone to storms, which damage the power lines, giving them a patchwork appearance. Many evergreen trees surround the neighborhood, but residents dislike them because they obstruct views of the ocean. This is why houses are built high up on the hill with large second stories to maximize the view. The sunsets are stunning, with the water reflecting the orange sky. However, the area is often overcast and damp, resulting in a constant layer of moss on surfaces. \n\nThe neighborhood is primarily populated by older adults, with more dogs than children.  Wild rabbits are a common sight, causing problems for gardeners but delighting local cats.  Various birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles, inhabit the area. There are no stores in the immediate vicinity, but a few seafood restaurants are located at the waterfront, along with rocky shores perfect for throwing stones. The bay is narrow, allowing for clear views of the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Southern town in Tennessee. Situated on a connecting street between two state highways, our street experiences more traffic than I prefer. However, aside from that, it's a peaceful and familiar community.  \n\nThe neighborhood is relatively stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing me to become acquainted with most of my neighbors.  \n\nDaily life revolves around typical suburban activities like yard work and household chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our street.  \n\nOur house, located at the corner, provides a clear view of the neighborhood's comings and goings. We are familiar with the usual vehicles and readily notice any unfamiliar ones. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on bikes, creating a typical suburban atmosphere.  \n\nAs a family of four – myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen – we work from home, spending much of our time outdoors, even in the rain. We frequently barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant aroma.  \n\nThe neighborhood is characterized by its abundance of trees, remnants of its wooded past, offering ample shade but requiring regular leaf removal in the fall.  \n\nThe lack of significant winters lately has extended the feeling of fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means we rarely use the front door, except when someone knocks, which is infrequent. \n\nWorking on my truck or other projects in the garage, with the doors open, allows me to feel more connected to the neighborhood.  \n\nHolidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with visiting relatives filling the neighborhood with extra cars, particularly during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas.  \n\nOverall, I enjoy living here. My only wish is that our street wasn't a throughway.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the high desert, characterized by its expansive stretches of dirt. The landscape is predominantly brown, and maintaining a lawn requires significant financial investment. While the neighborhood was once sparsely populated, recent years have witnessed substantial development, resembling a burgeoning city. Despite the changes, the community remains friendly, although, like any urban area, it has its share of both positive and negative aspects. I reside in a predominantly senior-friendly neighborhood.  \n\nThe local stores consist mainly of chain establishments like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale options, one needs to travel elsewhere. Construction appears to be the most prevalent industry in the city, likely due to the abundant undeveloped land. This ongoing development raises concerns as I prefer the current state of affairs. Having previously lived in a big city, I have no desire to return.\n\nMy full-time job is in construction, specializing in drywall and T-bar installation.  One of the things I appreciate about living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain have fostered distinct ecosystems that deserve protection. It's important for residents to understand and coexist peacefully with the local fauna. My family and I have successfully adapted to sharing our environment with wildlife. \n\nWhile Victorville offers some attractions, it's particularly appealing for families seeking a different kind of experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair provides a unique blend of entertainment and activities.  A trip to nearby Wrightwood allows visitors to enjoy snow-covered mountains and winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum offers insights into the region's natural history and culture, showcasing geological, paleontological, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "My neighborhood is unique because instead of a traditional residential area, it's the college campus where I live.  My dorm and its residents form my immediate community, while the broader campus extends my sense of neighborhood.  Despite this unconventional setting, my campus neighborhood shares similarities with typical neighborhoods. It has houses, people, shops, and even a park.\n\nThere are three main types of housing: apartments, regular houses, and dorms. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room with 4-6 rooms per floor, accommodating around 20 residents per building.  Houses are available for rent by anyone affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom setups. These are less common due to their size.  Dorms, the most prevalent housing type, accommodate hundreds of students, with two people sharing a room in most cases.\n\nMy school values diversity, which is reflected in the diverse residents of my neighborhood.  Faculty members often reside in the houses, newer students stay in dorms, and older students opt for apartments.\n\nThe campus is self-sufficient, boasting a variety of stores, including dining options, clothing outlets, and a grocery store.  A single park provides a recreational space for everyone.  The park is well-maintained and safe due to the collective responsibility of the neighborhood.",
            "After living in this neighborhood for ten years, I've collected quite a few memories. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was heartbroken leaving my friends and family behind. However, my parents believed this new location offered better housing, schools, and opportunities.  \n\nIt took time to adjust, but I made new friends and even some rivals at school.  I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I cherish our relationship. I vividly remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage ceremony – it was a wonderful celebration filled with joy and dancing.  I even caught a piece of his wife's veil!  \n\nThis neighborhood can feel like a maze, but I'm gradually exploring it with the help of my GPS. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis, reminiscing about our shared love for video games and enjoying life to the fullest. I also find solace in spending time in the park, where nature calms my soul.  Sometimes, I'll practice my balance with sticks or even bring my wooden sword for some practice. \n\nThere's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played either sport in a while. Still, it's comforting to know they're there if I ever want to pick them up again. My dad, along with Mr. Graves, introduced me and my best friend to tennis when we were younger, and we had a blast learning and playing.\n\nLooking back, I realize I've had countless joyful moments in this neighborhood.  While I have many stories, these are the ones that stand out the most, and I'm excited for even more adventures to come!",
            "My neighborhood, located near my college, is a mix of apartment buildings, a few budget-friendly restaurants and bars, and a predominantly young or lower-income population. While some buildings are older and might have newer interiors, there are also newer complexes with questionable construction quality and high rents. Despite a few drawbacks like the presence of drug use and less-than-stellar establishments, I enjoy the convenience of living close to campus, with easy access to amenities, the university, and public transportation. There are some disreputable areas nearby, but overall, I find my neighborhood to be affordable and practical.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses.  Painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, they create a charming, nostalgic atmosphere. While not everyone is close, many residents frequently gather at the end of driveways, chatting as children play. This sense of community is a welcome respite from the digital world. The peaceful surroundings are enhanced by fields, trees, and open skies, offering a tranquil escape.  However, the idyllic peace was recently disrupted by severe weather. Tornado warnings became a reality when sirens blared, prompting residents to seek shelter. Despite the initial fear, the storm passed, leaving behind a remarkable sight: a double rainbow. Neighborhood life quickly resumed, with families enjoying the evening outdoors as if nothing had happened. Though I'm new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've found this friendly community to be a perfect fit.\n\nThe neighborhood consists of two-bedroom, two-bathroom duplexes, though their interiors vary. Despite their uniformity on the outside, some apartments are surprisingly small.  I enjoy exploring the nearby fields and pond, where I've spotted deer and heard the calls of a giant bullfrog.  The location, just forty minutes from Charlotte, offers the best of both worlds: a peaceful rural setting and easy access to city amenities.  The sounds of roosters crowing from nearby farms and the occasional braying of a donkey create a unique and charming atmosphere.  \n\nI feel fortunate to have discovered this special community.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade.  It took a while to make friends, but I eventually became close to a couple of guys who lived nearby. Although they've since moved away, those memories remain. \n\nThe neighborhood itself hasn't changed much; it's typical of many American suburbs with its two-story houses and quiet atmosphere.  You often hear kids playing outside on weekends or warm days. \n\nI feel safe here.  I've never experienced any problems with neighbors, and my packages have always been delivered safely.  It's a place where you're left to your own devices unless you need assistance. \n\nThere's a park just a short walk from my house, filled with memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with friends.  It also holds a less pleasant memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game. Despite that, the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I take my cousins' kids there, watching them enjoy the swings and slides brings back a wave of nostalgia.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a short distance, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants.  While delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, fast food chains and pizza places are abundant, as you'd expect in any suburb.  \n\nLocal stores cater to all needs, with dry cleaners, pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, and a popular Midwest grocery chain, Jewel-Osco.  Even the stores reflect the diversity, with an Indian-owned shop for those seeking authentic Indian groceries or ingredients.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. Hearing about the challenges others face with their neighbors makes me appreciate the sense of community I have.",
            "Johnston, a small town in South Carolina, is unassuming but plays a significant role in the state's agricultural industry. Known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" its landscape is primarily dominated by peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spaced apart, often with metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat, and are typically situated back from the road to accommodate agricultural use. The town center features a single intersection with a traffic light, where the few stores are located.  \n\nDining options are limited to Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain).  A pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola.  Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store, is small and expensive, leading many residents to travel to larger supermarkets in nearby towns. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday essentials. Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing family business, sells furniture and employs local movers. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service.\n\nHealthcare services are provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both located away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the town's youngest residents, but older students attend schools in the neighboring town. While there are no designated parks currently, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development.  The town lacks amenities such as movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston retains a charming, small-town atmosphere.",
            "I first learned about my apartment building from a podcast about missing people, which was surprising since it's in a pricey area.  I had never heard of any such incidents, nor had my friends.  Despite the high cost of living, we've learned to be resourceful, finding value in secondhand items and embracing a more minimalist lifestyle.  Life can be tough, and some of my friends struggle financially, but we find ways to cope.  This area is filled with thrift stores, offering a haven from the bustling city outside.  Downtown is constantly evolving, becoming more crowded with cars and people each year. It reminds me of New York City, where everyone is focused on their own goals and there's a sense of independence and privacy.  However, despite the anonymity, there's also a strong sense of community among my neighbors.  We look out for each other, celebrating milestones and offering support during difficult times.  Although I live in a large, impersonal building, my neighbors make me feel like I belong and haven't made a mistake by choosing this place to live.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical, cookie-cutter suburb with a strong homeowners' association (HOA) presence.  The homes are all well-maintained single-family houses, with similar front yards featuring grass, landscaping, short driveways, and occasional trees.  Every home has a two-car garage. The roads are in excellent condition, recently paved, and pothole-free. While mostly single-story, some two-story homes are also found in the development. The neighborhood features a centralized mailbox system, similar to apartments, with a shared key fob for each resident's mailbox and larger lockers for packages.\n\nLocated on the outskirts of the city, the neighborhood blends suburban living with a rural feel. This provides ample space for amenities like multiple community pools, gated and well-maintained, and walking trails for residents. Its size allows for ample exercise opportunities without needing to visit a park.  \n\nThe community is primarily composed of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment.  There's also a smaller population of middle-aged and young professionals.  The city itself is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town charm. It offers most necessary amenities, including a mall for shopping, though it's smaller in size.  \n\nWhile the neighborhood itself lacks immediate access to major stores, a 15-minute drive provides a variety of options, from upscale grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a pleasant suburban lifestyle with access to both community amenities and city conveniences.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is economically disadvantaged, with lower property values and residents primarily from low-income backgrounds. Despite this, it's a pleasant place to live. Neighbors are friendly and crime, though slightly higher than in other parts of town, remains generally low. While there have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, our family has thankfully remained untouched except for occasional minor thefts. \n\nThe town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, leading to several fentanyl-related deaths. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction treatment centers and Narcan training programs.\n\nDespite these challenges, my town boasts positive aspects. My son attends a fantastic elementary school with dedicated staff who foster a positive environment. He has thrived there, free from bullying, and enjoys learning. An active PTO organizes numerous events to engage families and promote education.  The school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students, ensuring no child goes hungry, and fees for supplies and field trips are affordable, regardless of a family's financial situation.\n\nWhile city improvements like road repaving and park renovations have primarily benefitted the central area and west side, the east side, where I live, has been largely overlooked, a source of frustration for residents. \n\nOverall, I appreciate living in this town. The friendly atmosphere, excellent schools, ample shopping options, and our comfortable home make it a place we call home after 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is steeped in history and culture. Situated on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with significant pasts. I live in a seven-story apartment building across from a historic theater, near a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds, especially during warm summer evenings. A short distance away is a sizable city park, enclosed by concrete with a series of stairs built into the wall. During winter, homeless individuals often set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, seeking warmth as the rain and occasional snow make conditions challenging. Their proximity to the park's center and the nearby family center, which offers showers and other resources, provides them with crucial support. \n\nWhile the neighborhood boasts historical beauty, its true charm lies in its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, carries the memories of its turbulent past. Despite ongoing challenges, the community works hard to maintain its streets and care for its residents. Although warnings exist against walking alone in the area after dark, I believe they stem from outdated prejudices. I, perhaps due to my own mixed heritage, feel a sense of belonging here. Hilltop has shown me kindness and acceptance, reminding me that genuine connection can transcend societal biases.\n\nI've experienced firsthand the warmth of this community, from strangers offering me a jacket to laundromat owners extending their hours to help me charge my phone. Even on the gloomiest nights, I've encountered individuals who offered me words of encouragement and support. Hilltop, with its complexities and challenges, is a place where I feel truly alive and at home.",
            "My home is in a small town in rural Michigan, transitioning from farmland to tourist destinations. While lacking big-city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, the beauty of my surroundings is undeniable. I live by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches readily accessible.  My neighborhood reflects the quintessential small-town charm. Houses aren't identical cookie-cutter structures; they are unique, older homes, some modernized and others preserving their original character. Many feature full, visible basements and aluminum siding, with a colorful variety of styles lining the streets. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines, playsets, gardens, or animal enclosures.  \n\nThe neighborhood embodies the spirit of hardworking, family-oriented individuals. Children play freely on the streets, while adults enjoy walks with their dogs, bike rides, and rollerblading. Neighbors maintain a strong sense of community, readily recognizing each other and engaging in friendly interactions.  \n\nLawns are well-kept, free of debris, with trimmed bushes and greenery. \n\nWhile not visually stunning, the neighborhood's true value lies in its sense of safety, tranquility, and family-friendliness.  It's a place where people feel comfortable and welcome.  \n\nWithin walking distance, we have essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center. Local recreational activities, including baseball fields and a small airport, add to the charm. A nearby ice cream shop and downtown area are also within reach.  The convenience of nearby amenities, like the park just eight blocks away, makes this a truly great place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My neighborhood in a bustling city is incredibly diverse, with residential areas scattered among commercial zones filled with offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.  From well-known chains to trendy boutiques, there's no shortage of shopping or dining options. Parks provide green spaces for families with young children, and the neighborhood itself is a melting pot of cultures, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, Orthodox Jewish residents, and a sizable population of former Soviet immigrants. While the city boasts ethnic enclaves like Koreatown and Chinatown, these are often separated by considerable distances due to heavy traffic.

            "My neighborhood is a blend of traditional suburban homes, with some divided into two units while remaining attached. While it evokes a sense of nostalgia for the American dream of suburban living, there's a sense that this dream is fading. However, the neighborhood still holds onto that dream, with residents maintaining their homes and yards, albeit not as meticulously as in the past. Children still play with carefree abandon, and the local school, a fixture for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire hope for the future. \n\nThough churches are sparse and mostly empty, basketball courts remain lively.

A small movie theater, showing older films, caters to the older residents while younger people prefer newer releases.  A single expressway runs near the town, but residents, particularly the elders, opposed plans for an exit, fearing it would disrupt the neighborhood's character.  The community is currently debating a mascot for a new high school, with a unique blend of modern and traditional elements being considered.",

            "She questioned the vastness of the landscape as we drove past endless cornfields stretching towards the horizon. I knew she'd be surprised by the openness, having grown up in a town where the grocery store was just a short walk away. This was the stark contrast to her life, a world dominated by sprawling fields.  I shared stories of my childhood in rural Ohio, helping her understand the landscape and my roots.\n\nTurning onto a two-lane country road, we reached a quarry now filled with water. Just past it lay the small development where I live. The houses, predominantly brick and stucco, each occupy at least half an acre of land, meticulously maintained by their owners. Spring bursts with colorful blooms alongside the changing hues of the midwestern trees. Gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars lined the driveways, reflecting the midday sun after a thorough cleaning.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was tending to his lawn, his friendly face and cheerful singing audible above the hum of his John Deere mower. He is a beloved figure, despite his aging and occasional witticisms fading with time. His past as a doctor adds a unique layer to his character.  He blends seamlessly with the grass and his mower, a constant presence in the neighborhood.\n\nMy home is marked by a side yard bustling with geese and our playful terrier. Behind the house, a small stream winds its way to the quarry, its gentle sound accompanied by the croaking of bullfrogs and the distant \"moo\" of farm animals.  A handmade wooden bridge leads to a secluded oasis, a haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood sanctuary, filled with tree forts, imaginary hunts, and endless opportunities for friendship with neighborhood kids.\n\nThe winters in our small town can be harsh, but they possess a unique beauty. The vibrant green turns into a stark wilderness, trees stripped bare, yet breathtaking in their simplicity. Snowfall transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland, adorned with snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I, though often at odds, found solace in snowball fights and constructing elaborate igloo-like forts, wielding branches as weapons.  In this winter wonderland, our world shrunk to the realm of make-believe, a time of pure childhood joy and carefree laughter.",
            "Portland, Oregon's identity is deeply tied to its \"weird\" culture.  This isn't just a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era; it's an invitation to embrace the city's unique blend of creativity and unconventional subcultures. Despite increasing gentrification and a booming population, Portland retains its quirky spirit. \"Weird\" in Portland means accepting the unusual and challenging norms, while still acknowledging the realities of modern life, including consumerism and its challenges. \n\nPortland is a tapestry of diverse individuals and experiences. You'll find yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, professionals, and everyone in between. Perhaps what defines \"weird\" in Portland is a lighter approach to life, an appreciation for the unexpected, and a willingness to embrace the unconventional. The city's neighborhoods often feature colorful houses, vibrant gardens, and \"free boxes\" – makeshift treasure troves filled with discarded but potentially valuable items.\n\nThis spirit of discovery and resourcefulness is a hallmark of Portland.  However, Portland also grapples with issues like drug addiction and homelessness, stemming from both mental health challenges and societal shortcomings. The city's commitment to social services attracts those in need, but the system struggles to meet the demands.  \n\nUltimately, Portland is a city of contradictions, where the acceptance of the unusual coexists with the realities of hardship. It's a place where people chase their dreams, find solace in community, and embrace the magic hidden in the everyday.",

            "Visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy thanks to its excellent public transportation links. As a quintessential urban neighborhood, you'll feel right at home in the bustling city atmosphere. Bensonhurst has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades, resulting in a vibrant Asian business scene.

These businesses are popular with both locals and newcomers due to their high-quality goods, competitive prices, and convenience.  \n\nBeyond its Asian heritage, Bensonhurst is a diverse neighborhood with a mix of immigrants, first- and second-generation Americans. While many businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a recently renovated park offering amenities like basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op or condominium apartments. While the residents are generally friendly, the neighborhood can be quite noisy, with loud cars a common occurrence. \n\nWhile generally safe, Bensonhurst does have its share of challenges. Petty crime, such as package theft, can occur, and there are instances of unpredictable behavior.  \n\nAnother noticeable issue is a lack of adherence to leash laws, resulting in dog waste being frequently found on sidewalks.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill, with limited sidewalks and roads that are in need of repair. The area is prone to storms, which damage the power lines, giving them a patchwork appearance. Many evergreen trees surround the neighborhood, but residents dislike them because they obstruct views of the ocean. This is why houses are built high up on the hill with large second stories to maximize the view. The sunsets are stunning, with the water reflecting the orange sky. However, the area is often overcast and damp, resulting in a constant layer of moss on surfaces. \n\nThe neighborhood is primarily populated by older adults, with more dogs than children.  Wild rabbits are a common sight, causing problems for gardeners but delighting local cats.  Various birds, including sparrows, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles, inhabit the area. There are no stores in the immediate vicinity, but a few seafood restaurants are located at the waterfront, along with rocky shores perfect for throwing stones. The bay is narrow, allowing for clear views of the opposite shoreline even through the mist.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban neighborhood in a small Southern town in Tennessee. Situated on a connecting street between two state highways, our street experiences more traffic than I prefer. However, aside from that, it's a peaceful and familiar community.  \n\nThe neighborhood is relatively stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing me to become acquainted with most of my neighbors.  \n\nDaily life revolves around typical suburban activities like yard work and household chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our street.  \n\nOur house, located at the corner, provides a clear view of the neighborhood's comings and goings. We are familiar with the usual vehicles and readily notice any unfamiliar ones. Some neighbors engage in walking for exercise or to walk their dogs, while children play on bikes, creating a typical suburban atmosphere.  \n\nAs a family of four – myself, my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen – we work from home, spending much of our time outdoors, even in the rain. We frequently barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with a pleasant aroma.  \n\nThe neighborhood is characterized by its abundance of trees, remnants of its wooded past, offering ample shade but requiring regular leaf removal in the fall.  \n\nThe lack of significant winters lately has extended the feeling of fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means we rarely use the front door, except when someone knocks, which is infrequent. \n\nWorking on my truck or other projects in the garage, with the doors open, allows me to feel more connected to the neighborhood.  \n\nHolidays bring a temporary increase in activity, with visiting relatives filling the neighborhood with extra cars, particularly during Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, and Christmas.  \n\nOverall, I enjoy living here. My only wish is that our street wasn't a throughway.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the high desert, characterized by its expansive stretches of dirt. The landscape is predominantly brown, and maintaining a lawn requires significant financial investment. While the neighborhood was once sparsely populated, recent years have witnessed substantial development, resembling a burgeoning city. Despite the changes, the community remains friendly, although, like any urban area, it has its share of both positive and negative aspects. I reside in a predominantly senior-friendly neighborhood.  \n\nThe local stores consist mainly of chain establishments like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale options, one needs to travel elsewhere. Construction appears to be the most prevalent industry in the city, likely due to the abundant undeveloped land. This ongoing development raises concerns as I prefer the current state of affairs. Having previously lived in a big city, I have no desire to return.\n\nMy full-time job is in construction, specializing in drywall and T-bar installation.  One of the things I appreciate about living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique climate and terrain have fostered distinct ecosystems that deserve protection. It's important for residents to understand and coexist peacefully with the local fauna. My family and I have successfully adapted to sharing our environment with wildlife. \n\nWhile Victorville offers some attractions, it's particularly appealing for families seeking a different kind of experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair provides a unique blend of entertainment and activities.  A trip to nearby Wrightwood allows visitors to enjoy snow-covered mountains and winter sports. The Victor Valley Museum offers insights into the region's natural history and culture, showcasing geological, paleontological, Native American artifacts, and historical objects.",
            "My neighborhood is unique because instead of a traditional residential area, it's the college campus where I live.  My dorm and its residents form my immediate community, while the broader campus extends my sense of neighborhood.  Despite this unconventional setting, my campus neighborhood shares similarities with typical neighborhoods. It has houses, people, shops, and even a park.\n\nThere are three main types of housing: apartments, regular houses, and dorms. Apartments typically house 2-4 people per room with 4-6 rooms per floor, accommodating around 20 residents per building.  Houses are available for rent by anyone affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom setups. These are less common due to their size.  Dorms, the most prevalent housing type, accommodate hundreds of students, with two people sharing a room in most cases.\n\nMy school values diversity, which is reflected in the diverse residents of my neighborhood.  Faculty members often reside in the houses, newer students stay in dorms, and older students opt for apartments.\n\nThe campus is self-sufficient, boasting a variety of stores, including dining options, clothing outlets, and a grocery store.  A single park provides a recreational space for everyone.  The park is well-maintained and safe due to the collective responsibility of the neighborhood.",
            "After living in this neighborhood for ten years, I've collected quite a few memories. When I first moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was heartbroken leaving my friends and family behind. However, my parents believed this new location offered better housing, schools, and opportunities.  \n\nIt took time to adjust, but I made new friends and even some rivals at school.  I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I cherish our relationship. I vividly remember attending Mr. Glen's remarriage ceremony – it was a wonderful celebration filled with joy and dancing.  I even caught a piece of his wife's veil!  \n\nThis neighborhood can feel like a maze, but I'm gradually exploring it with the help of my GPS. I've ventured out with my friends Kason and Curtis, reminiscing about our shared love for video games and enjoying life to the fullest. I also find solace in spending time in the park, where nature calms my soul.  Sometimes, I'll practice my balance with sticks or even bring my wooden sword for some practice. \n\nThere's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played either sport in a while. Still, it's comforting to know they're there if I ever want to pick them up again. My dad, along with Mr. Graves, introduced me and my best friend to tennis when we were younger, and we had a blast learning and playing.\n\nLooking back, I realize I've had countless joyful moments in this neighborhood.  While I have many stories, these are the ones that stand out the most, and I'm excited for even more adventures to come!",
            "My neighborhood, located near my college, is a mix of apartment buildings, a few budget-friendly restaurants and bars, and a predominantly young or lower-income population. While some buildings are older and might have newer interiors, there are also newer complexes with questionable construction quality and high rents. Despite a few drawbacks like the presence of drug use and less-than-stellar establishments, I enjoy the convenience of living close to campus, with easy access to amenities, the university, and public transportation. There are some disreputable areas nearby, but overall, I find my neighborhood to be affordable and practical.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses.  Painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, they create a charming, nostalgic atmosphere. While not everyone is close, many residents frequently gather at the end of driveways, chatting as children play. This sense of community is a welcome respite from the digital world. The peaceful surroundings are enhanced by fields, trees, and open skies, offering a tranquil escape.  However, the idyllic peace was recently disrupted by severe weather. Tornado warnings became a reality when sirens blared, prompting residents to seek shelter. Despite the initial fear, the storm passed, leaving behind a remarkable sight: a double rainbow. Neighborhood life quickly resumed, with families enjoying the evening outdoors as if nothing had happened. Though I'm new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've found this friendly community to be a perfect fit.\n\nThe neighborhood consists of two-bedroom, two-bathroom duplexes, though their interiors vary. Despite their uniformity on the outside, some apartments are surprisingly small.  I enjoy exploring the nearby fields and pond, where I've spotted deer and heard the calls of a giant bullfrog.  The location, just forty minutes from Charlotte, offers the best of both worlds: a peaceful rural setting and easy access to city amenities.  The sounds of roosters crowing from nearby farms and the occasional braying of a donkey create a unique and charming atmosphere.  \n\nI feel fortunate to have discovered this special community.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade.  It took a while to make friends, but I eventually became close to a couple of guys who lived nearby. Although they've since moved away, those memories remain. \n\nThe neighborhood itself hasn't changed much; it's typical of many American suburbs with its two-story houses and quiet atmosphere.  You often hear kids playing outside on weekends or warm days. \n\nI feel safe here.  I've never experienced any problems with neighbors, and my packages have always been delivered safely.  It's a place where you're left to your own devices unless you need assistance. \n\nThere's a park just a short walk from my house, filled with memories of playing basketball, football, and baseball with friends.  It also holds a less pleasant memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game. Despite that, the good times outweigh the bad. Now, I take my cousins' kids there, watching them enjoy the swings and slides brings back a wave of nostalgia.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a short distance, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants.  While delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash are popular, fast food chains and pizza places are abundant, as you'd expect in any suburb.  \n\nLocal stores cater to all needs, with dry cleaners, pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, and a popular Midwest grocery chain, Jewel-Osco.  Even the stores reflect the diversity, with an Indian-owned shop for those seeking authentic Indian groceries or ingredients.\n\nOverall, I'm happy living here. Hearing about the challenges others face with their neighbors makes me appreciate the sense of community I have.",
            "Johnston, a small town in South Carolina, is unassuming but plays a significant role in the state's agricultural industry. Known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" its landscape is primarily dominated by peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses are spaced apart, often with metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat, and are typically situated back from the road to accommodate agricultural use. The town center features a single intersection with a traffic light, where the few stores are located.  \n\nDining options are limited to Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's (a small burger chain).  A pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its Cherry Coca-Cola.  Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store, is small and expensive, leading many residents to travel to larger supermarkets in nearby towns. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday essentials. Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing family business, sells furniture and employs local movers. Attached to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service.\n\nHealthcare services are provided by a small doctor's office and a veterinary clinic, both located away from the town center. Johnston Elementary School serves the town's youngest residents, but older students attend schools in the neighboring town. While there are no designated parks currently, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development.  The town lacks amenities such as movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. Despite its limited attractions, Johnston retains a charming, small-town atmosphere.",
            "I first learned about my apartment building from a podcast about missing people, which was surprising since it's in a pricey area.  I had never heard of any such incidents, nor had my friends.  Despite the high cost of living, we've learned to be resourceful, finding value in secondhand items and embracing a more minimalist lifestyle.  Life can be tough, and some of my friends struggle financially, but we find ways to cope.  This area is filled with thrift stores, offering a haven from the bustling city outside.  Downtown is constantly evolving, becoming more crowded with cars and people each year. It reminds me of New York City, where everyone is focused on their own goals and there's a sense of independence and privacy.  However, despite the anonymity, there's also a strong sense of community among my neighbors.  We look out for each other, celebrating milestones and offering support during difficult times.  Although I live in a large, impersonal building, my neighbors make me feel like I belong and haven't made a mistake by choosing this place to live.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical, cookie-cutter suburb with a strong homeowners' association (HOA) presence.  The homes are all well-maintained single-family houses, with similar front yards featuring grass, landscaping, short driveways, and occasional trees.  Every home has a two-car garage. The roads are in excellent condition, recently paved, and pothole-free. While mostly single-story, some two-story homes are also found in the development. The neighborhood features a centralized mailbox system, similar to apartments, with a shared key fob for each resident's mailbox and larger lockers for packages.\n\nLocated on the outskirts of the city, the neighborhood blends suburban living with a rural feel. This provides ample space for amenities like multiple community pools, gated and well-maintained, and walking trails for residents. Its size allows for ample exercise opportunities without needing to visit a park.  \n\nThe community is primarily composed of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment.  There's also a smaller population of middle-aged and young professionals.  The city itself is surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town charm. It offers most necessary amenities, including a mall for shopping, though it's smaller in size.  \n\nWhile the neighborhood itself lacks immediate access to major stores, a 15-minute drive provides a variety of options, from upscale grocery stores to bargain outlets. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a pleasant suburban lifestyle with access to both community amenities and city conveniences.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is economically disadvantaged, with lower property values and residents primarily from low-income backgrounds. Despite this, it's a pleasant place to live. Neighbors are friendly and crime, though slightly higher than in other parts of town, remains generally low. While there have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, our family has thankfully remained untouched except for occasional minor thefts. \n\nThe town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, leading to several fentanyl-related deaths. However, there are numerous resources available to combat this issue, such as addiction treatment centers and Narcan training programs.\n\nDespite these challenges, my town boasts positive aspects. My son attends a fantastic elementary school with dedicated staff who foster a positive environment. He has thrived there, free from bullying, and enjoys learning. An active PTO organizes numerous events to engage families and promote education.  The school provides free breakfast and lunch for all students, ensuring no child goes hungry, and fees for supplies and field trips are affordable, regardless of a family's financial situation.\n\nWhile city improvements like road repaving and park renovations have primarily benefitted the central area and west side, the east side, where I live, has been largely overlooked, a source of frustration for residents. \n\nOverall, I appreciate living in this town. The friendly atmosphere, excellent schools, ample shopping options, and our comfortable home make it a place we call home after 16 years.",
            "My neighborhood is steeped in history and culture. Situated on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with significant pasts. I live in a seven-story apartment building across from a historic theater, near a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds, especially during warm summer evenings. A short distance away is a sizable city park, enclosed by concrete with a series of stairs built into the wall. During winter, homeless individuals often set up tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and steps, seeking warmth as the rain and occasional snow make conditions challenging. Their proximity to the park's center and the nearby family center, which offers showers and other resources, provides them with crucial support. \n\nWhile the neighborhood boasts historical beauty, its true charm lies in its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence, carries the memories of its turbulent past. Despite ongoing challenges, the community works hard to maintain its streets and care for its residents. Although warnings exist against walking alone in the area after dark, I believe they stem from outdated prejudices. I, perhaps due to my own mixed heritage, feel a sense of belonging here. Hilltop has shown me kindness and acceptance, reminding me that genuine connection can transcend societal biases.\n\nI've experienced firsthand the warmth of this community, from strangers offering me a jacket to laundromat owners extending their hours to help me charge my phone. Even on the gloomiest nights, I've encountered individuals who offered me words of encouragement and support. Hilltop, with its complexities and challenges, is a place where I feel truly alive and at home.",
            "My home is in a small town in rural Michigan, transitioning from farmland to tourist destinations. While lacking big-city amenities like malls or chain restaurants, the beauty of my surroundings is undeniable. I live by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, with beaches readily accessible.  My neighborhood reflects the quintessential small-town charm. Houses aren't identical cookie-cutter structures; they are unique, older homes, some modernized and others preserving their original character. Many feature full, visible basements and aluminum siding, with a colorful variety of styles lining the streets. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines, playsets, gardens, or animal enclosures.  \n\nThe neighborhood embodies the spirit of hardworking, family-oriented individuals. Children play freely on the streets, while adults enjoy walks with their dogs, bike rides, and rollerblading. Neighbors maintain a strong sense of community, readily recognizing each other and engaging in friendly interactions.  \n\nLawns are well-kept, free of debris, with trimmed bushes and greenery. \n\nWhile not visually stunning, the neighborhood's true value lies in its sense of safety, tranquility, and family-friendliness.  It's a place where people feel comfortable and welcome.  \n\nWithin walking distance, we have essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center. Local recreational activities, including baseball fields and a small airport, add to the charm. A nearby ice cream shop and downtown area are also within reach.  The convenience of nearby amenities, like the park just eight blocks away, makes this a truly great place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city neighborhood is incredibly diverse, with residential areas interspersed between commercial zones bustling with various businesses like offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The abundance of dining and shopping options is impressive, featuring both large, well-known brands and increasingly popular small boutiques found in malls and lining the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods.  \n\nParks are scattered throughout the area, attracting families with young children. The neighborhood itself is a tapestry of diverse communities, including a prominent LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a population of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. While these communities are concentrated in certain areas, the city boasts distinct ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, though these are spread out and can be difficult to reach due to the city's notorious traffic congestion. \n\nDespite the proximity of attractions, walking is rarely an option due to the city's vast size and heavy reliance on cars, leading to significant traffic and parking challenges.  The city has seen an influx of construction projects, primarily large apartment buildings, attracting new residents but causing concern about increased population density and traffic. \n\nHousing options are diverse, encompassing houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, condominiums, single-family homes, and duplexes. This variety extends to the neighborhood's demographics, with residents of different ages and backgrounds. While not a tight-knit community like it once was, the neighborhood still offers a range of living experiences.",
            "My neighborhood is a mix of traditional single-family homes, some of which have been divided into duplexes while still maintaining a connected structure. My house, like many others, has a small front yard and driveway, evoking a bygone era when suburban living symbolized the American dream. While this dream feels less attainable now, my neighborhood persists, clinging to its ideals and reminding us that the dream endures. Residents, though less optimistic than they once were, still maintain their homes, albeit with less meticulous care. Children still play with boundless energy, and the 90-year-old public school continues to offer hope for the future while sparking nostalgia in older generations. Churches are sparsely populated, but basketball courts remain bustling hubs of activity.  \n\nDespite their diverse appearances, the homes share a common feeling. A large supermarket, owned by a Yemeni family, stands as a representation of the neighborhood's changing demographics, which are predominantly African American. Wide streets accommodate children playing football, their games momentarily interrupted by passing cars. Many long-time residents have generational roots in the neighborhood, recalling a time when close-knit communities were the norm.  \n\nA former karate school, now a pharmacy, reflects the fading influence of cultural trends, while a small movie theater, showing classic films at discounted prices, caters to older generations who appreciate a nostalgic night out. A nearby expressway, with its entrance and exit located in the neighboring town, divided residents, with younger generations supporting its inclusion and older ones fearing its disruption to the neighborhood's character.  \n\nThe construction of a new high school has sparked a debate about a mascot, with my suggestion of a cyborg embodying both the neighborhood's blend of tradition and modernization.",
            "Hidden behind a strip mall and old, deserted buildings, lies a vibrant community that most people overlook.  A cluster of apartment complexes, like carefully arranged nesting dolls, stand side-by-side. While some have a questionable reputation, others offer a glimpse into a hidden world unknown to the general public.  Across from these complexes is a quiet community college campus, where sleepy students, fueled by coffee, start their day. Their arrival often causes traffic jams for frustrated commuters.  The road intersects with a residential street featuring a park, a rehabilitation center, and a strip mall. The park buzzes with activity: children play, dogs are walked, and teenagers skateboard and socialize. The strip mall itself houses a diverse mix of businesses - a sushi place, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, a frozen yogurt shop, and more. This neighborhood, a slice of classic American life in the slow-paced south, seems timeless, untouched by change.",
            "As we drove past endless cornfields, she questioned where everything was. I knew she'd be surprised by the emptiness of the landscape, coming from a town where everything was within walking distance. Overwhelmed by the vastness of the cornfields, I shared stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I was from.\n\nThe road led us to a quarry filled with water, just past which lay the small development I call home. The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each sit on at least half an acre of land, meticulously cared for by their owners. Spring bursts with vibrant flowers, and the midwestern trees change color with each season. Gleaming Mercedes Benz cars line the driveways, reflecting the midday sun after a thorough wash.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco home, my friendly Korean neighbor, always outside, could be seen tending to his lawn. He spends his days mowing, his cheerful singing blending with the hum of his mower. Everyone enjoys his antics, but beneath his playful demeanor lies a kind and unique individual with a fascinating past. He used to be a doctor and now blends seamlessly into the background as he meticulously maintains his lawn.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. Geese roam the side yard, pursued by our terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, filled with the sounds of bullfrogs, water, and distant farm animals. A handmade wooden bridge leads to a serene oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers - a place where I spent most of my childhood.  \n\nFrom building tree forts to chasing animals, my childhood was filled with adventures and friends. The winters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking. The lush green transforms into a barren wilderness, the colorful trees reduced to bare branches. Snowfall transforms the backyard into a winter wonderland, adorned with snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I, who often fought, waged war with snowballs from our elaborate igloo-like forts, creating our own little world of make-believe, where childhood worries seemed to melt away.",
            "Portland, Oregon, embraces a unique sense of \"weirdness\" celebrated in its unofficial slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This slogan evokes a nostalgia for the city's less known and affordable past, a time when it fostered diverse and unconventional subcultures.  It also serves as an invitation to a community that welcomes individuality and celebrates those who dare to be different. Despite the influx of wealthier residents and the ongoing construction boom, Portland retains its quirky charm.  \"Weird\" in Portland doesn't mean blind acceptance, but rather an openness to things that might be considered unusual elsewhere. Like any other city, Portland grapples with modern issues like consumerism and social inequalities. However, it  finds a balance between embracing its unconventional spirit and accommodating traditional aspects of life.\n\nPortland's neighborhoods showcase this duality. Vibrant houses adorned with colorful gardens, lined with free boxes offering unexpected treasures, create an atmosphere of creativity and community.  These boxes, filled with discarded items, symbolize the city's spirit of resourcefulness and sharing.  \n\nPortland's \"weirdness\" manifests in  diverse ways, from goat yoga to passionate support for the local soccer team.  The city offers a space for individuals to pursue their dreams, even if those dreams involve spending a little too much time at the bar. \n\nLike any urban center, Portland faces challenges such as drug addiction and homelessness, often linked to mental health issues and inadequate support systems.  The response from the community, while varied, reflects the broader societal struggle to address these complex problems.",
            "The imposing mountains to the north have always been a constant presence in my life. They stand unwavering, a silent testament to the passage of time, regardless of my own preoccupations. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they beckon me to seek solace in their presence.  Their steadfastness grants me strength and reminds me to persevere, one day at a time. I was first drawn to these mountains when I moved to this town for university. While the campus itself is beautiful, with its unique architecture and serene ponds, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is charming in its own right, with cozy cafes and a bustling downtown area that echoes with the energy of a nearby city. Yet, just a short distance away, the tranquility of a small town returns. This blend of urban and suburban life creates a unique and captivating atmosphere.  \n\nOver time, I've made countless memories here, both joyful and painful.  The ponds, in particular, have served as a place of reflection and sometimes, tears shed during moments of existential crisis. Observing the lives of the turtles, ducks, and insects, I often pondered my own purpose and place in the world.\n\nOne morning, seeking solace, I walked past the familiar ponds and houses, drawn northwards by an unseen force. As the sun rose, illuminating the palm trees, I realized I was heading towards the mountains. Their majestic presence, towering above everything else, filled me with a renewed sense of determination.",
            "Finding Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy due to its excellent public transportation links. Being a predominantly urban neighborhood, you'll experience the quintessential New York City vibe. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in a noticeable presence of Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, every few blocks.  These businesses are highly popular among locals due to their high-quality products, affordable prices, and convenience.  \n\nWhile Bensonhurst has diverse residents, including immigrants and their American-born children, Asian-owned businesses dominate the commercial landscape. The neighborhood also boasts a recently renovated park featuring basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. This park reflects the city's diversity, with people from various backgrounds interacting harmoniously. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op/condominium apartments, with few large corporate buildings. The community is generally friendly but can be quite noisy, with traffic often disrupting peace. While generally safe, Bensonhurst experiences some unpredictability at night, with occasional instances of petty crime.  \n\nAdditionally, residents seem to disregard the city's rules about cleaning up after pets, leading to a common sight of dog waste on sidewalks.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill with limited sidewalks, forcing residents to walk on the road which is in poor condition.  The area is prone to storms, causing frequent power line damage and giving the neighborhood a somewhat dilapidated appearance.  Despite the abundance of tall evergreen trees, residents dislike them due to their obstruction of ocean views, leading to many houses built high up with expansive second stories. The sunsets are spectacular with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, but the frequent overcast skies often obscure the sun. The damp climate results in moss growing everywhere, even on cars. The neighborhood is largely populated by older residents, with dogs being more common than children.  Rabbits are plentiful, causing issues for gardeners but delighting local cats.  While there are no stores nearby, a few seafood restaurants can be found at the waterfront, along with rocks perfect for throwing into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing for clear views of the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "My family and I live in a quiet, suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Our street is a connector between two state highways, leading to more traffic than I prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful place.  We've settled into a comfortable routine with our neighbors, most of whom are familiar faces.  Life here revolves around everyday tasks like yard work and taking walks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill.  Living at the corner, we have a good view of the neighborhood and know most of the passing cars. We're home frequently as we work remotely.  Our family of four consists of my wife, myself, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen.  They spend time playing outside, even in the rain, and we often enjoy grilling on our back deck. \n\nThe neighborhood is characterized by its lush greenery, with many trees shading our homes.  This means lots of leaves to rake and burn in the fall, a yearly ritual I enjoy.  We've had a mild winter recently, making it feel more like an extended autumn.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone visits. I often work on projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.  Holidays bring a bit more activity, with visitors and extra cars, but generally, our neighborhood is quiet and welcoming.  I love living here; a little less traffic would make it perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the high desert, characterized by its dry, dusty landscape.  The lack of greenery is striking, with lawns being a rare and expensive sight.  While the area was once sparsely populated, recent years have seen significant development, blurring the lines between rural and urban life. Despite the growth, the community remains friendly, with a predominantly older demographic.  \n\nShopping options are limited to chain stores, lacking upscale or specialty retailers.  Construction is a dominant industry, likely due to the vast undeveloped land available for building, which worries me as I prefer the current pace of development. I work as a drywall and T-bar installer, a profession tied to the construction boom.\n\nOne of the best aspects of living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique environment supports a variety of species, reminding us of the importance of coexisting harmoniously with nature. My children, for instance, are fascinated by lizards and desert insects.\n\nWhile Victorville offers some attractions, it's particularly appealing for families seeking a unique desert experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a highlight, offering a blend of fun and local flavor.  A nearby trip to Wrightwood allows visitors to enjoy snowy mountain views and winter sports. For those interested in history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum houses exhibits showcasing the region's geological, paleontological, Native American, and industrial heritage.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a little different from what others might say. While most people picture traditional houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is actually the college campus where I live. My dorm building and its residents form my immediate community, with the surrounding campus extending that sense of neighborhood, albeit less intensely.  Despite this unique perspective, my campus still shares similarities with typical neighborhoods. It has houses, people, shops, and even a park. \n\nLet's start with the \"houses.\" There are three main types: apartments, traditional houses, and dorm buildings. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging around 20 residents per building. Traditional houses, available for rent by anyone affiliated with the school, are typically 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these are less common. Dorm rooms, the most prevalent type, house hundreds of students, usually in pairs.\n\nMy school is known for its diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. People from all backgrounds and ages live here. Faculty members tend to live in the traditional houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students opt for apartments. \n\nBeyond housing, my neighborhood pulsates with life.  It boasts a variety of stores, including dining options, school-branded merchandise, and groceries, providing everything residents need. There's also a central park, a shared space where everyone can relax and enjoy themselves, kept safe and clean by the community.",
            "Although initially feeling sad when moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge 10 years ago, I eventually grew accustomed to my new neighborhood. While I made new friends and enemies at school, I formed close bonds with Mr. Glen and his family, who I consider almost like family. \n\nI cherish fond memories like attending Mr. Glen's remarriage, where I caught his wife's wedding favor. I also enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of his daughters, though we haven't met since.\n\nThe neighborhood itself feels like a maze, but I'm gradually exploring it with the help of GPS. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. I find solace in nature walks at the local park, practicing balance with sticks and occasionally bringing my bokken wooden sword.\n\nAlthough I haven't played tennis or basketball recently, the courts are a welcome reminder of my childhood, when my dad and Mr. Graves taught me the sport.\n\nLooking back, I've had many enjoyable experiences in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college, which is a major reason I enjoy living there. While primarily composed of apartment buildings, it offers a few affordable and fun restaurants and bars. \n\nOne bar recently underwent a name change and now has higher prices, but the quality of service and drinks remains decent. The neighborhood's residents are mainly students or individuals with lower incomes, reflecting the relatively affordable apartment rentals. The presence of a nearby elementary school adds to the family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nAlthough I don't know my neighbors well, I'm not particularly interested in getting to know them due to their frequent marijuana use. The building management's attempt to mask the smell with an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusingly insulting, highlights this. \n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older but might have modern interiors. Newer apartment complexes down the street, while aesthetically pleasing, have questionable construction quality and overpriced rentals, taking advantage of their proximity to the university.\n\nA budget-friendly eatery nearby serves food on paper plates and mainly relies on microwaved dishes. Across the street is a gas station with a poor reputation. However, recent city improvements have enhanced the area with a wider sidewalk, landscaped medians, and a more pleasant aesthetic.\n\nMy apartment complex is nestled among trees, although a few were removed, leaving behind stumps. In contrast, the street behind my building (43rd street) is less appealing, with deteriorated sidewalks, dilapidated buildings, and a higher crime rate associated with a transient population.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, I appreciate living here. The affordability, proximity to the university, and convenient access to buses and stores make it a suitable place for me.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses. All are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly and often gather at the ends of their driveways in the evenings, chatting while the children play. This simple, close-knit atmosphere is a welcome contrast to the increasingly digital world. The surrounding fields, trees, and clear skies create a peaceful, almost nostalgic ambiance. Recently, however, we've experienced severe weather, including tornado warnings and sirens. During one particularly stormy night, we sought shelter in our homes, witnessing heavy hail and a dramatic temperature drop. Despite the unsettling experience, the aftermath brought a breathtaking double rainbow, which I captured in photographs for my loved ones. Life returned to normal quickly, with families resuming their routines. \n\nAs a recent transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've found this friendly neighborhood to be a true gem. While all the duplexes look the same from the outside, their interiors vary. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home to a nearby pond, where I've encountered deer and listened to the morning chorus of a bullfrog. The peaceful setting, just forty minutes from Charlotte, is further enhanced by the sounds of roosters crowing from neighboring farms and the occasional braying of a donkey. This close-knit community feels like a village of its own.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. While making friends initially proved challenging, I eventually forged strong bonds with two neighbors who, sadly, no longer reside here.  Despite the changes, many original residents remain, making it feel like a typical American suburb. \n\nTwo-story houses dominate the landscape, and the weekends, especially when the weather is warm, are filled with the sound of children playing. The neighborhood is generally quiet, with a strong sense of community. I've always felt safe and secure here, never experiencing any issues with neighbors or package theft.  \n\nA park just minutes from my house holds countless memories. I spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood friends, though I also experienced a memorable (and painful) nose injury during a football game. Despite the occasional mishap, the good times outweigh the bad, and now I enjoy taking my younger cousins there for swings and slides.\n\nThe park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.  \n\nThe neighborhood boasts incredible diversity, reflected in the array of restaurants within a one-mile radius, offering everything from Chinese and Indian to Mexican and Italian cuisine. While delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become popular, fast food chains and pizza places are also prevalent.  \n\nEssential stores are conveniently located nearby, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store.  An Indian-owned store caters to those seeking authentic Indian ingredients or ready-made meals.\n\nOverall, I'm incredibly fortunate to call this neighborhood home. Witnessing the challenges others face with their neighbors through social media and news reports makes me truly appreciate the sense of community and safety I experience here.",
            "Johnston, a small South Carolina town, is known for its significant contribution to the agricultural sector, earning it the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is largely characterized by farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches dominating the landscape. Houses are typically two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, set back from the roads to accommodate fields for farming or animal grazing. \n\nThe town center features a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the limited commercial establishments are located. Residents have a choice of three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's Burger chain.  A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its unique Cherry Coca-Cola.  \n\nIndependent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store in town, is pricey, prompting many residents to travel to nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.  Dollar General, however, is a popular choice for everyday necessities.  Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing local business, offers furniture and delivery services, and is attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming establishment.  \n\nMedical care is provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary clinic, both located outside the main town area.  Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger residents, but students continue their education in the neighboring town for middle and high school.  \n\nWhile lacking traditional recreational facilities like parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under development.  Despite the limited entertainment options, Johnston remains a charming and tight-knit community.",
            "Hearing about my apartment building's connection to a missing person case was a surprise. The area was known for its high rents, and I, along with my friends, hadn't heard any such stories. Despite the financial struggles many faced, we'd learned to be resourceful, finding joy in bargains and secondhand finds. But the reality of living frugally was inescapable, a constant reminder of our circumstances. \n\nMy neighborhood boasts several thrift stores within walking distance, each offering a unique experience. Downtown bustles with activity, but these quiet havens offer a peaceful escape. It's a city in constant development, experiencing the growing pains of rapid expansion.  The atmosphere reminded me of New York: focused individuals pursuing their goals, respecting each other's boundaries. It's a place where solitude is respected, and personal lives are kept private.\n\nLiving here feels more like being part of a community than simply sharing an apartment building. We support each other through life's milestones, offering help and companionship. Despite the impersonal nature of the modernist buildings, my neighbors create a sense of belonging and warmth. Their kindness and consideration make me feel like my life hasn't been a complete failure. I'm grateful for their presence and the sense of connection they bring to this urban sprawl.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowner's association presence.  The uniformity is evident in the well-maintained single-family homes, each with a small, similar lawn, decorative stones, a short driveway, and a two-car garage. The roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA's efforts.  \n\nWhile most homes are single-story, some are two-story.  The neighborhood doesn't have traditional mailboxes; instead, there's a centralized mailbox cluster, reminiscent of apartment complexes, with individual mailboxes and larger package lockers.\n\nLocated on the edge of a city, my neighborhood blends suburban living with a rural feel.  We have ample space, featuring community pools, walking trails, and plenty of room for recreation. The community is primarily composed of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment. There are also some middle-aged and younger professionals.  \n\nAlthough the city itself is surprisingly large, it retains a small-town atmosphere. It offers essential amenities, including a modest mall. While major shopping centers require a 15-minute drive, they provide a wide range of options, from upscale grocery stores to discount outlets.  \n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a comfortable suburban lifestyle with convenient access to both community amenities and shopping centers.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered the town's most economically disadvantaged area.  While property values are low and mostly occupied by low-income individuals, it's not unattractive or unpleasant. The neighborhood is characterized by friendly residents who greet each other warmly. Although crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain generally low.  There have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home in the past decade. Sadly, our neighbors experienced the loss of their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has thankfully avoided direct involvement with crime, aside from occasional minor thefts from our porch.\n\nThe town, like many in the US, has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, resulting in numerous fentanyl-related deaths. However, the town offers resources to combat this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families and friends of those struggling with substance abuse.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many positive aspects. My son attends an excellent elementary school with dedicated staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel.  He has thrived in the school's positive environment, free from bullying despite his special needs. The active PTO organizes numerous events to promote family engagement and educational progress.  \n\nRecognizing that over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry.  The school fosters an inclusive environment where no family feels marginalized due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are also kept reasonable.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made notable improvements to the town's appearance, including road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations.  However, these improvements have primarily been concentrated in the central area and the west side, which houses the commercial district and sees most of the traffic. The east side, where I live, has received less attention, a point of contention for residents in my neighborhood.\n\nOverall, I find joy in living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are exceptional, there are ample shopping options, both local businesses and larger retail stores, to meet our family's needs, and while our home may not have a high market value, it is comfortable and suitable for our family. We have called this town home for over 16 years and can't envision ourselves living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is steeped in history and culture. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with significant pasts. I live in a seven-story apartment building across from a historic theater, and a short distance away is a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds, especially during warm summer evenings. The neighborhood also boasts a sizable city park, enclosed by concrete and stairs, where during harsh winters, homeless individuals seek shelter in organized rows along the sidewalks and steps.  They congregate here for warmth and proximity to the nearest family center, offering them access to basic necessities. \n\nWhile Hilltop's historical charm is captivating, it's the resilience and warmth of its people that truly define the neighborhood. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, a history still echoed in stories passed down through generations. Despite this past, the residents work tirelessly to maintain their community, demonstrating a strong sense of pride and care.\n\nThough a lingering warning persists against white individuals walking alone in the neighborhood after dark, I believe it's a relic of the past, rooted in outdated social conditioning. Perhaps my own background allows me to be seen as one of their own, someone who recognizes the ongoing struggle against racism and prejudice.  \n\nHilltop is more than just a place; it's a feeling. I feel safe and alive walking its streets, encountering kindness and generosity from its residents, who offer help more readily than harm. I've experienced firsthand their compassion, from a laundromat owner extending closing time to charge my phone to someone offering me a five-dollar bill and words of encouragement on a bleak night. Hilltop, with its imperfections and complexities, will always be my home.",
            "I reside in a rural Michigan town, transitioning from farmland to small tourist destinations.  This area lacks large chain stores like malls, Walmart, Target, or even restaurants like Applebee's, requiring car travel for these amenities. Despite this, I live in a stunning location surrounded by water. Both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, offering beaches at every turn. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, each with a unique character, ranging from updated homes to older, well-maintained ones, many featuring full basements visible from the street. While some houses sport aluminum siding, the neighborhood boasts a vibrant array of colors. Most homes have yards, often filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even animal enclosures. \n\nThe neighborhood reflects a strong sense of community, with hardworking individuals raising or having raised families. Children play freely in the streets, while residents are frequently seen walking dogs, biking, rollerblading, and engaging with each other in friendly gestures. Neighbors know one another, creating a distinct sense of belonging. Lawns are well-maintained, reflecting a pride in the community. \n\nWhile the houses may not be architecturally stunning, they convey a sense of warmth and security, ideal for raising a family. The town offers a peaceful and safe environment with essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center within walking distance. \n\nRecreational activities abound, with nearby baseball and softball fields, a small airport, and an ice cream parlor. The town park is just a short bike ride away, making it a truly great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city neighborhood is incredibly diverse, with residential areas interspersed between commercial zones bustling with various businesses like offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The abundance of dining and shopping options is impressive, featuring both large, well-known brands and increasingly popular small boutiques found in malls and lining the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods.  \n\nParks are scattered throughout the area, attracting families with young children. The neighborhood itself is a tapestry of diverse communities, including a prominent LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a population of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. While these communities are concentrated in certain areas, the city boasts distinct ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, though these are spread out and can be difficult to reach due to the city's notorious traffic congestion. \n\nDespite the proximity of attractions, walking is rarely an option due to the city's vast size and heavy reliance on cars, leading to significant traffic and parking challenges.  The city has seen an influx of construction projects, primarily large apartment buildings, attracting new residents but causing concern about increased population density and traffic. \n\nHousing options are diverse, encompassing houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, condominiums, single-family homes, and duplexes. This variety extends to the neighborhood's demographics, with residents of different ages and backgrounds. While not a tight-knit community like it once was, the neighborhood still offers a range of living experiences.",
            "My neighborhood is a mix of traditional single-family homes, some of which have been divided into duplexes while still maintaining a connected structure. My house, like many others, has a small front yard and driveway, evoking a bygone era when suburban living symbolized the American dream. While this dream feels less attainable now, my neighborhood persists, clinging to its ideals and reminding us that the dream endures. Residents, though less optimistic than they once were, still maintain their homes, albeit with less meticulous care. Children still play with boundless energy, and the 90-year-old public school continues to offer hope for the future while sparking nostalgia in older generations. Churches are sparsely populated, but basketball courts remain bustling hubs of activity.  \n\nDespite their diverse appearances, the homes share a common feeling. A large supermarket, owned by a Yemeni family, stands as a representation of the neighborhood's changing demographics, which are predominantly African American. Wide streets accommodate children playing football, their games momentarily interrupted by passing cars. Many long-time residents have generational roots in the neighborhood, recalling a time when close-knit communities were the norm.  \n\nA former karate school, now a pharmacy, reflects the fading influence of cultural trends, while a small movie theater, showing classic films at discounted prices, caters to older generations who appreciate a nostalgic night out. A nearby expressway, with its entrance and exit located in the neighboring town, divided residents, with younger generations supporting its inclusion and older ones fearing its disruption to the neighborhood's character.  \n\nThe construction of a new high school has sparked a debate about a mascot, with my suggestion of a cyborg embodying both the neighborhood's blend of tradition and modernization.",
            "Hidden behind a strip mall and old, deserted buildings, lies a vibrant community that most people overlook.  A cluster of apartment complexes, like carefully arranged nesting dolls, stand side-by-side. While some have a questionable reputation, others offer a glimpse into a hidden world unknown to the general public.  Across from these complexes is a quiet community college campus, where sleepy students, fueled by coffee, start their day. Their arrival often causes traffic jams for frustrated commuters.  The road intersects with a residential street featuring a park, a rehabilitation center, and a strip mall. The park buzzes with activity: children play, dogs are walked, and teenagers skateboard and socialize. The strip mall itself houses a diverse mix of businesses - a sushi place, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, a frozen yogurt shop, and more. This neighborhood, a slice of classic American life in the slow-paced south, seems timeless, untouched by change.",
            "As we drove past endless cornfields, she questioned where everything was. I knew she'd be surprised by the emptiness of the landscape, coming from a town where everything was within walking distance. Overwhelmed by the vastness of the cornfields, I shared stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I was from.\n\nThe road led us to a quarry filled with water, just past which lay the small development I call home. The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each sit on at least half an acre of land, meticulously cared for by their owners. Spring bursts with vibrant flowers, and the midwestern trees change color with each season. Gleaming Mercedes Benz cars line the driveways, reflecting the midday sun after a thorough wash.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco home, my friendly Korean neighbor, always outside, could be seen tending to his lawn. He spends his days mowing, his cheerful singing blending with the hum of his mower. Everyone enjoys his antics, but beneath his playful demeanor lies a kind and unique individual with a fascinating past. He used to be a doctor and now blends seamlessly into the background as he meticulously maintains his lawn.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. Geese roam the side yard, pursued by our terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, filled with the sounds of bullfrogs, water, and distant farm animals. A handmade wooden bridge leads to a serene oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers - a place where I spent most of my childhood.  \n\nFrom building tree forts to chasing animals, my childhood was filled with adventures and friends. The winters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking. The lush green transforms into a barren wilderness, the colorful trees reduced to bare branches. Snowfall transforms the backyard into a winter wonderland, adorned with snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I, who often fought, waged war with snowballs from our elaborate igloo-like forts, creating our own little world of make-believe, where childhood worries seemed to melt away.",
            "Portland, Oregon, embraces a unique sense of \"weirdness\" celebrated in its unofficial slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This slogan evokes a nostalgia for the city's less known and affordable past, a time when it fostered diverse and unconventional subcultures.  It also serves as an invitation to a community that welcomes individuality and celebrates those who dare to be different. Despite the influx of wealthier residents and the ongoing construction boom, Portland retains its quirky charm.  \"Weird\" in Portland doesn't mean blind acceptance, but rather an openness to things that might be considered unusual elsewhere. Like any other city, Portland grapples with modern issues like consumerism and social inequalities. However, it  finds a balance between embracing its unconventional spirit and accommodating traditional aspects of life.\n\nPortland's neighborhoods showcase this duality. Vibrant houses adorned with colorful gardens, lined with free boxes offering unexpected treasures, create an atmosphere of creativity and community.  These boxes, filled with discarded items, symbolize the city's spirit of resourcefulness and sharing.  \n\nPortland's \"weirdness\" manifests in  diverse ways, from goat yoga to passionate support for the local soccer team.  The city offers a space for individuals to pursue their dreams, even if those dreams involve spending a little too much time at the bar. \n\nLike any urban center, Portland faces challenges such as drug addiction and homelessness, often linked to mental health issues and inadequate support systems.  The response from the community, while varied, reflects the broader societal struggle to address these complex problems.",
            "The imposing mountains to the north have always been a constant presence in my life. They stand unwavering, a silent testament to the passage of time, regardless of my own preoccupations. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they beckon me to seek solace in their presence.  Their steadfastness grants me strength and reminds me to persevere, one day at a time. I was first drawn to these mountains when I moved to this town for university. While the campus itself is beautiful, with its unique architecture and serene ponds, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is charming in its own right, with cozy cafes and a bustling downtown area that echoes with the energy of a nearby city. Yet, just a short distance away, the tranquility of a small town returns. This blend of urban and suburban life creates a unique and captivating atmosphere.  \n\nOver time, I've made countless memories here, both joyful and painful.  The ponds, in particular, have served as a place of reflection and sometimes, tears shed during moments of existential crisis. Observing the lives of the turtles, ducks, and insects, I often pondered my own purpose and place in the world.\n\nOne morning, seeking solace, I walked past the familiar ponds and houses, drawn northwards by an unseen force. As the sun rose, illuminating the palm trees, I realized I was heading towards the mountains. Their majestic presence, towering above everything else, filled me with a renewed sense of determination.",
            "Finding Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy due to its excellent public transportation links. Being a predominantly urban neighborhood, you'll experience the quintessential New York City vibe. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in a noticeable presence of Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, every few blocks.  These businesses are highly popular among locals due to their high-quality products, affordable prices, and convenience.  \n\nWhile Bensonhurst has diverse residents, including immigrants and their American-born children, Asian-owned businesses dominate the commercial landscape. The neighborhood also boasts a recently renovated park featuring basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. This park reflects the city's diversity, with people from various backgrounds interacting harmoniously. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op/condominium apartments, with few large corporate buildings. The community is generally friendly but can be quite noisy, with traffic often disrupting peace. While generally safe, Bensonhurst experiences some unpredictability at night, with occasional instances of petty crime.  \n\nAdditionally, residents seem to disregard the city's rules about cleaning up after pets, leading to a common sight of dog waste on sidewalks.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill with limited sidewalks, forcing residents to walk on the road which is in poor condition.  The area is prone to storms, causing frequent power line damage and giving the neighborhood a somewhat dilapidated appearance.  Despite the abundance of tall evergreen trees, residents dislike them due to their obstruction of ocean views, leading to many houses built high up with expansive second stories. The sunsets are spectacular with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, but the frequent overcast skies often obscure the sun. The damp climate results in moss growing everywhere, even on cars. The neighborhood is largely populated by older residents, with dogs being more common than children.  Rabbits are plentiful, causing issues for gardeners but delighting local cats.  While there are no stores nearby, a few seafood restaurants can be found at the waterfront, along with rocks perfect for throwing into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing for clear views of the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "My family and I live in a quiet, suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Our street is a connector between two state highways, leading to more traffic than I prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful place.  We've settled into a comfortable routine with our neighbors, most of whom are familiar faces.  Life here revolves around everyday tasks like yard work and taking walks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill.  Living at the corner, we have a good view of the neighborhood and know most of the passing cars. We're home frequently as we work remotely.  Our family of four consists of my wife, myself, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen.  They spend time playing outside, even in the rain, and we often enjoy grilling on our back deck. \n\nThe neighborhood is characterized by its lush greenery, with many trees shading our homes.  This means lots of leaves to rake and burn in the fall, a yearly ritual I enjoy.  We've had a mild winter recently, making it feel more like an extended autumn.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone visits. I often work on projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.  Holidays bring a bit more activity, with visitors and extra cars, but generally, our neighborhood is quiet and welcoming.  I love living here; a little less traffic would make it perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the high desert, characterized by its dry, dusty landscape.  The lack of greenery is striking, with lawns being a rare and expensive sight.  While the area was once sparsely populated, recent years have seen significant development, blurring the lines between rural and urban life. Despite the growth, the community remains friendly, with a predominantly older demographic.  \n\nShopping options are limited to chain stores, lacking upscale or specialty retailers.  Construction is a dominant industry, likely due to the vast undeveloped land available for building, which worries me as I prefer the current pace of development. I work as a drywall and T-bar installer, a profession tied to the construction boom.\n\nOne of the best aspects of living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique environment supports a variety of species, reminding us of the importance of coexisting harmoniously with nature. My children, for instance, are fascinated by lizards and desert insects.\n\nWhile Victorville offers some attractions, it's particularly appealing for families seeking a unique desert experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a highlight, offering a blend of fun and local flavor.  A nearby trip to Wrightwood allows visitors to enjoy snowy mountain views and winter sports. For those interested in history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum houses exhibits showcasing the region's geological, paleontological, Native American, and industrial heritage.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a little different from what others might say. While most people picture traditional houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is actually the college campus where I live. My dorm building and its residents form my immediate community, with the surrounding campus extending that sense of neighborhood, albeit less intensely.  Despite this unique perspective, my campus still shares similarities with typical neighborhoods. It has houses, people, shops, and even a park. \n\nLet's start with the \"houses.\" There are three main types: apartments, traditional houses, and dorm buildings. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging around 20 residents per building. Traditional houses, available for rent by anyone affiliated with the school, are typically 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these are less common. Dorm rooms, the most prevalent type, house hundreds of students, usually in pairs.\n\nMy school is known for its diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. People from all backgrounds and ages live here. Faculty members tend to live in the traditional houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students opt for apartments. \n\nBeyond housing, my neighborhood pulsates with life.  It boasts a variety of stores, including dining options, school-branded merchandise, and groceries, providing everything residents need. There's also a central park, a shared space where everyone can relax and enjoy themselves, kept safe and clean by the community.",
            "Although initially feeling sad when moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge 10 years ago, I eventually grew accustomed to my new neighborhood. While I made new friends and enemies at school, I formed close bonds with Mr. Glen and his family, who I consider almost like family. \n\nI cherish fond memories like attending Mr. Glen's remarriage, where I caught his wife's wedding favor. I also enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of his daughters, though we haven't met since.\n\nThe neighborhood itself feels like a maze, but I'm gradually exploring it with the help of GPS. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. I find solace in nature walks at the local park, practicing balance with sticks and occasionally bringing my bokken wooden sword.\n\nAlthough I haven't played tennis or basketball recently, the courts are a welcome reminder of my childhood, when my dad and Mr. Graves taught me the sport.\n\nLooking back, I've had many enjoyable experiences in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college, which is a major reason I enjoy living there. While primarily composed of apartment buildings, it offers a few affordable and fun restaurants and bars. \n\nOne bar recently underwent a name change and now has higher prices, but the quality of service and drinks remains decent. The neighborhood's residents are mainly students or individuals with lower incomes, reflecting the relatively affordable apartment rentals. The presence of a nearby elementary school adds to the family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nAlthough I don't know my neighbors well, I'm not particularly interested in getting to know them due to their frequent marijuana use. The building management's attempt to mask the smell with an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusingly insulting, highlights this. \n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older but might have modern interiors. Newer apartment complexes down the street, while aesthetically pleasing, have questionable construction quality and overpriced rentals, taking advantage of their proximity to the university.\n\nA budget-friendly eatery nearby serves food on paper plates and mainly relies on microwaved dishes. Across the street is a gas station with a poor reputation. However, recent city improvements have enhanced the area with a wider sidewalk, landscaped medians, and a more pleasant aesthetic.\n\nMy apartment complex is nestled among trees, although a few were removed, leaving behind stumps. In contrast, the street behind my building (43rd street) is less appealing, with deteriorated sidewalks, dilapidated buildings, and a higher crime rate associated with a transient population.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, I appreciate living here. The affordability, proximity to the university, and convenient access to buses and stores make it a suitable place for me.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses. All are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly and often gather at the ends of their driveways in the evenings, chatting while the children play. This simple, close-knit atmosphere is a welcome contrast to the increasingly digital world. The surrounding fields, trees, and clear skies create a peaceful, almost nostalgic ambiance. Recently, however, we've experienced severe weather, including tornado warnings and sirens. During one particularly stormy night, we sought shelter in our homes, witnessing heavy hail and a dramatic temperature drop. Despite the unsettling experience, the aftermath brought a breathtaking double rainbow, which I captured in photographs for my loved ones. Life returned to normal quickly, with families resuming their routines. \n\nAs a recent transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've found this friendly neighborhood to be a true gem. While all the duplexes look the same from the outside, their interiors vary. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home to a nearby pond, where I've encountered deer and listened to the morning chorus of a bullfrog. The peaceful setting, just forty minutes from Charlotte, is further enhanced by the sounds of roosters crowing from neighboring farms and the occasional braying of a donkey. This close-knit community feels like a village of its own.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. While making friends initially proved challenging, I eventually forged strong bonds with two neighbors who, sadly, no longer reside here.  Despite the changes, many original residents remain, making it feel like a typical American suburb. \n\nTwo-story houses dominate the landscape, and the weekends, especially when the weather is warm, are filled with the sound of children playing. The neighborhood is generally quiet, with a strong sense of community. I've always felt safe and secure here, never experiencing any issues with neighbors or package theft.  \n\nA park just minutes from my house holds countless memories. I spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood friends, though I also experienced a memorable (and painful) nose injury during a football game. Despite the occasional mishap, the good times outweigh the bad, and now I enjoy taking my younger cousins there for swings and slides.\n\nThe park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.  \n\nThe neighborhood boasts incredible diversity, reflected in the array of restaurants within a one-mile radius, offering everything from Chinese and Indian to Mexican and Italian cuisine. While delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become popular, fast food chains and pizza places are also prevalent.  \n\nEssential stores are conveniently located nearby, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store.  An Indian-owned store caters to those seeking authentic Indian ingredients or ready-made meals.\n\nOverall, I'm incredibly fortunate to call this neighborhood home. Witnessing the challenges others face with their neighbors through social media and news reports makes me truly appreciate the sense of community and safety I experience here.",
            "Johnston, a small South Carolina town, is known for its significant contribution to the agricultural sector, earning it the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is largely characterized by farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches dominating the landscape. Houses are typically two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, set back from the roads to accommodate fields for farming or animal grazing. \n\nThe town center features a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the limited commercial establishments are located. Residents have a choice of three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's Burger chain.  A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its unique Cherry Coca-Cola.  \n\nIndependent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store in town, is pricey, prompting many residents to travel to nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.  Dollar General, however, is a popular choice for everyday necessities.  Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing local business, offers furniture and delivery services, and is attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming establishment.  \n\nMedical care is provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary clinic, both located outside the main town area.  Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger residents, but students continue their education in the neighboring town for middle and high school.  \n\nWhile lacking traditional recreational facilities like parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under development.  Despite the limited entertainment options, Johnston remains a charming and tight-knit community.",
            "Hearing about my apartment building's connection to a missing person case was a surprise. The area was known for its high rents, and I, along with my friends, hadn't heard any such stories. Despite the financial struggles many faced, we'd learned to be resourceful, finding joy in bargains and secondhand finds. But the reality of living frugally was inescapable, a constant reminder of our circumstances. \n\nMy neighborhood boasts several thrift stores within walking distance, each offering a unique experience. Downtown bustles with activity, but these quiet havens offer a peaceful escape. It's a city in constant development, experiencing the growing pains of rapid expansion.  The atmosphere reminded me of New York: focused individuals pursuing their goals, respecting each other's boundaries. It's a place where solitude is respected, and personal lives are kept private.\n\nLiving here feels more like being part of a community than simply sharing an apartment building. We support each other through life's milestones, offering help and companionship. Despite the impersonal nature of the modernist buildings, my neighbors create a sense of belonging and warmth. Their kindness and consideration make me feel like my life hasn't been a complete failure. I'm grateful for their presence and the sense of connection they bring to this urban sprawl.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowner's association presence.  The uniformity is evident in the well-maintained single-family homes, each with a small, similar lawn, decorative stones, a short driveway, and a two-car garage. The roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA's efforts.  \n\nWhile most homes are single-story, some are two-story.  The neighborhood doesn't have traditional mailboxes; instead, there's a centralized mailbox cluster, reminiscent of apartment complexes, with individual mailboxes and larger package lockers.\n\nLocated on the edge of a city, my neighborhood blends suburban living with a rural feel.  We have ample space, featuring community pools, walking trails, and plenty of room for recreation. The community is primarily composed of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment. There are also some middle-aged and younger professionals.  \n\nAlthough the city itself is surprisingly large, it retains a small-town atmosphere. It offers essential amenities, including a modest mall. While major shopping centers require a 15-minute drive, they provide a wide range of options, from upscale grocery stores to discount outlets.  \n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a comfortable suburban lifestyle with convenient access to both community amenities and shopping centers.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered the town's most economically disadvantaged area.  While property values are low and mostly occupied by low-income individuals, it's not unattractive or unpleasant. The neighborhood is characterized by friendly residents who greet each other warmly. Although crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain generally low.  There have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home in the past decade. Sadly, our neighbors experienced the loss of their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has thankfully avoided direct involvement with crime, aside from occasional minor thefts from our porch.\n\nThe town, like many in the US, has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, resulting in numerous fentanyl-related deaths. However, the town offers resources to combat this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families and friends of those struggling with substance abuse.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many positive aspects. My son attends an excellent elementary school with dedicated staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel.  He has thrived in the school's positive environment, free from bullying despite his special needs. The active PTO organizes numerous events to promote family engagement and educational progress.  \n\nRecognizing that over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry.  The school fosters an inclusive environment where no family feels marginalized due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are also kept reasonable.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made notable improvements to the town's appearance, including road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations.  However, these improvements have primarily been concentrated in the central area and the west side, which houses the commercial district and sees most of the traffic. The east side, where I live, has received less attention, a point of contention for residents in my neighborhood.\n\nOverall, I find joy in living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are exceptional, there are ample shopping options, both local businesses and larger retail stores, to meet our family's needs, and while our home may not have a high market value, it is comfortable and suitable for our family. We have called this town home for over 16 years and can't envision ourselves living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is steeped in history and culture. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with significant pasts. I live in a seven-story apartment building across from a historic theater, and a short distance away is a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds, especially during warm summer evenings. The neighborhood also boasts a sizable city park, enclosed by concrete and stairs, where during harsh winters, homeless individuals seek shelter in organized rows along the sidewalks and steps.  They congregate here for warmth and proximity to the nearest family center, offering them access to basic necessities. \n\nWhile Hilltop's historical charm is captivating, it's the resilience and warmth of its people that truly define the neighborhood. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, a history still echoed in stories passed down through generations. Despite this past, the residents work tirelessly to maintain their community, demonstrating a strong sense of pride and care.\n\nThough a lingering warning persists against white individuals walking alone in the neighborhood after dark, I believe it's a relic of the past, rooted in outdated social conditioning. Perhaps my own background allows me to be seen as one of their own, someone who recognizes the ongoing struggle against racism and prejudice.  \n\nHilltop is more than just a place; it's a feeling. I feel safe and alive walking its streets, encountering kindness and generosity from its residents, who offer help more readily than harm. I've experienced firsthand their compassion, from a laundromat owner extending closing time to charge my phone to someone offering me a five-dollar bill and words of encouragement on a bleak night. Hilltop, with its imperfections and complexities, will always be my home.",
            "I reside in a rural Michigan town, transitioning from farmland to small tourist destinations.  This area lacks large chain stores like malls, Walmart, Target, or even restaurants like Applebee's, requiring car travel for these amenities. Despite this, I live in a stunning location surrounded by water. Both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, offering beaches at every turn. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, each with a unique character, ranging from updated homes to older, well-maintained ones, many featuring full basements visible from the street. While some houses sport aluminum siding, the neighborhood boasts a vibrant array of colors. Most homes have yards, often filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even animal enclosures. \n\nThe neighborhood reflects a strong sense of community, with hardworking individuals raising or having raised families. Children play freely in the streets, while residents are frequently seen walking dogs, biking, rollerblading, and engaging with each other in friendly gestures. Neighbors know one another, creating a distinct sense of belonging. Lawns are well-maintained, reflecting a pride in the community. \n\nWhile the houses may not be architecturally stunning, they convey a sense of warmth and security, ideal for raising a family. The town offers a peaceful and safe environment with essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center within walking distance. \n\nRecreational activities abound, with nearby baseball and softball fields, a small airport, and an ice cream parlor. The town park is just a short bike ride away, making it a truly great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My city neighborhood is incredibly diverse, with residential areas interspersed between commercial zones bustling with various businesses like offices, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The abundance of dining and shopping options is impressive, featuring both large, well-known brands and increasingly popular small boutiques found in malls and lining the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods.  \n\nParks are scattered throughout the area, attracting families with young children. The neighborhood itself is a tapestry of diverse communities, including a prominent LGBTQ+ group, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a population of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. While these communities are concentrated in certain areas, the city boasts distinct ethnic enclaves like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, though these are spread out and can be difficult to reach due to the city's notorious traffic congestion. \n\nDespite the proximity of attractions, walking is rarely an option due to the city's vast size and heavy reliance on cars, leading to significant traffic and parking challenges.  The city has seen an influx of construction projects, primarily large apartment buildings, attracting new residents but causing concern about increased population density and traffic. \n\nHousing options are diverse, encompassing houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, condominiums, single-family homes, and duplexes. This variety extends to the neighborhood's demographics, with residents of different ages and backgrounds. While not a tight-knit community like it once was, the neighborhood still offers a range of living experiences.",
            "My neighborhood is a mix of traditional single-family homes, some of which have been divided into duplexes while still maintaining a connected structure. My house, like many others, has a small front yard and driveway, evoking a bygone era when suburban living symbolized the American dream. While this dream feels less attainable now, my neighborhood persists, clinging to its ideals and reminding us that the dream endures. Residents, though less optimistic than they once were, still maintain their homes, albeit with less meticulous care. Children still play with boundless energy, and the 90-year-old public school continues to offer hope for the future while sparking nostalgia in older generations. Churches are sparsely populated, but basketball courts remain bustling hubs of activity.  \n\nDespite their diverse appearances, the homes share a common feeling. A large supermarket, owned by a Yemeni family, stands as a representation of the neighborhood's changing demographics, which are predominantly African American. Wide streets accommodate children playing football, their games momentarily interrupted by passing cars. Many long-time residents have generational roots in the neighborhood, recalling a time when close-knit communities were the norm.  \n\nA former karate school, now a pharmacy, reflects the fading influence of cultural trends, while a small movie theater, showing classic films at discounted prices, caters to older generations who appreciate a nostalgic night out. A nearby expressway, with its entrance and exit located in the neighboring town, divided residents, with younger generations supporting its inclusion and older ones fearing its disruption to the neighborhood's character.  \n\nThe construction of a new high school has sparked a debate about a mascot, with my suggestion of a cyborg embodying both the neighborhood's blend of tradition and modernization.",
            "Hidden behind a strip mall and old, deserted buildings, lies a vibrant community that most people overlook.  A cluster of apartment complexes, like carefully arranged nesting dolls, stand side-by-side. While some have a questionable reputation, others offer a glimpse into a hidden world unknown to the general public.  Across from these complexes is a quiet community college campus, where sleepy students, fueled by coffee, start their day. Their arrival often causes traffic jams for frustrated commuters.  The road intersects with a residential street featuring a park, a rehabilitation center, and a strip mall. The park buzzes with activity: children play, dogs are walked, and teenagers skateboard and socialize. The strip mall itself houses a diverse mix of businesses - a sushi place, a swimming supply store, a nail salon, a frozen yogurt shop, and more. This neighborhood, a slice of classic American life in the slow-paced south, seems timeless, untouched by change.",
            "As we drove past endless cornfields, she questioned where everything was. I knew she'd be surprised by the emptiness of the landscape, coming from a town where everything was within walking distance. Overwhelmed by the vastness of the cornfields, I shared stories about growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally understood where I was from.\n\nThe road led us to a quarry filled with water, just past which lay the small development I call home. The houses, mostly brick and stucco, each sit on at least half an acre of land, meticulously cared for by their owners. Spring bursts with vibrant flowers, and the midwestern trees change color with each season. Gleaming Mercedes Benz cars line the driveways, reflecting the midday sun after a thorough wash.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco home, my friendly Korean neighbor, always outside, could be seen tending to his lawn. He spends his days mowing, his cheerful singing blending with the hum of his mower. Everyone enjoys his antics, but beneath his playful demeanor lies a kind and unique individual with a fascinating past. He used to be a doctor and now blends seamlessly into the background as he meticulously maintains his lawn.\n\nFinally, we reached my home. Geese roam the side yard, pursued by our terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, filled with the sounds of bullfrogs, water, and distant farm animals. A handmade wooden bridge leads to a serene oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers - a place where I spent most of my childhood.  \n\nFrom building tree forts to chasing animals, my childhood was filled with adventures and friends. The winters in our small town are harsh but breathtaking. The lush green transforms into a barren wilderness, the colorful trees reduced to bare branches. Snowfall transforms the backyard into a winter wonderland, adorned with snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I, who often fought, waged war with snowballs from our elaborate igloo-like forts, creating our own little world of make-believe, where childhood worries seemed to melt away.",
            "Portland, Oregon, embraces a unique sense of \"weirdness\" celebrated in its unofficial slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This slogan evokes a nostalgia for the city's less known and affordable past, a time when it fostered diverse and unconventional subcultures.  It also serves as an invitation to a community that welcomes individuality and celebrates those who dare to be different. Despite the influx of wealthier residents and the ongoing construction boom, Portland retains its quirky charm.  \"Weird\" in Portland doesn't mean blind acceptance, but rather an openness to things that might be considered unusual elsewhere. Like any other city, Portland grapples with modern issues like consumerism and social inequalities. However, it  finds a balance between embracing its unconventional spirit and accommodating traditional aspects of life.\n\nPortland's neighborhoods showcase this duality. Vibrant houses adorned with colorful gardens, lined with free boxes offering unexpected treasures, create an atmosphere of creativity and community.  These boxes, filled with discarded items, symbolize the city's spirit of resourcefulness and sharing.  \n\nPortland's \"weirdness\" manifests in  diverse ways, from goat yoga to passionate support for the local soccer team.  The city offers a space for individuals to pursue their dreams, even if those dreams involve spending a little too much time at the bar. \n\nLike any urban center, Portland faces challenges such as drug addiction and homelessness, often linked to mental health issues and inadequate support systems.

            "The imposing mountains to the north have always been a constant presence in my life. They stand unwavering, a silent testament to the passage of time, regardless of my own preoccupations. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they beckon me to seek solace in their presence.  Their steadfastness grants me strength and reminds me to persevere, one day at a time. I was first drawn to these mountains when I moved to this town for university. While the campus itself is beautiful, with its unique architecture and serene ponds, the mountains hold a special place in my heart.\n\nThe town is charming in its own right, with cozy cafes and a bustling downtown area that echoes with the energy of a nearby city. Yet, just a short distance away, the tranquility of a small town returns. This blend of urban and suburban life creates a unique and captivating atmosphere.  \n\nOver time, I've made countless memories here, both joyful and painful.  The ponds, in particular, have served as a place of reflection and sometimes, tears shed during moments of existential crisis. Observing the lives of the turtles, ducks, and insects, I often pondered my own purpose and place in the world.\n\nOne morning, seeking solace, I walked past the familiar ponds and houses, drawn northwards by an unseen force. As the sun rose, illuminating the palm trees, I realized I was heading towards the mountains. Their majestic presence, towering above everything else, filled me with a renewed sense of determination.",
            "Finding Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is easy due to its excellent public transportation links. Being a predominantly urban neighborhood, you'll experience the quintessential New York City vibe. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has seen a significant influx of Asian residents, resulting in a noticeable presence of Asian-owned businesses, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, every few blocks.  These businesses are highly popular among locals due to their high-quality products, affordable prices, and convenience.  \n\nWhile Bensonhurst has diverse residents, including immigrants and their American-born children, Asian-owned businesses dominate the commercial landscape. The neighborhood also boasts a recently renovated park featuring basketball courts, a soccer/baseball field, handball courts, a playground, and a water fountain. This park reflects the city's diversity, with people from various backgrounds interacting harmoniously. \n\nHousing in Bensonhurst primarily consists of two-family houses and co-op/condominium apartments, with few large corporate buildings. The community is generally friendly but can be quite noisy, with traffic often disrupting peace. While generally safe, Bensonhurst experiences some unpredictability at night, with occasional instances of petty crime.  \n\nAdditionally, residents seem to disregard the city's rules about cleaning up after pets, leading to a common sight of dog waste on sidewalks.",
            "My neighborhood is situated on a steep hill with limited sidewalks, forcing residents to walk on the road which is in poor condition.  The area is prone to storms, causing frequent power line damage and giving the neighborhood a somewhat dilapidated appearance.  Despite the abundance of tall evergreen trees, residents dislike them due to their obstruction of ocean views, leading to many houses built high up with expansive second stories. The sunsets are spectacular with the water glowing and the sky turning orange, but the frequent overcast skies often obscure the sun. The damp climate results in moss growing everywhere, even on cars. The neighborhood is largely populated by older residents, with dogs being more common than children.  Rabbits are plentiful, causing issues for gardeners but delighting local cats.  While there are no stores nearby, a few seafood restaurants can be found at the waterfront, along with rocks perfect for throwing into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing for clear views of the opposite shore even through the mist.",
            "My family and I live in a quiet, suburban neighborhood in a small Tennessee town. Our street is a connector between two state highways, leading to more traffic than I prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful place.  We've settled into a comfortable routine with our neighbors, most of whom are familiar faces.  Life here revolves around everyday tasks like yard work and taking walks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a nearby hill.  Living at the corner, we have a good view of the neighborhood and know most of the passing cars. We're home frequently as we work remotely.  Our family of four consists of my wife, myself, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen.  They spend time playing outside, even in the rain, and we often enjoy grilling on our back deck. \n\nThe neighborhood is characterized by its lush greenery, with many trees shading our homes.  This means lots of leaves to rake and burn in the fall, a yearly ritual I enjoy.  We've had a mild winter recently, making it feel more like an extended autumn.  Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone visits. I often work on projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.  Holidays bring a bit more activity, with visitors and extra cars, but generally, our neighborhood is quiet and welcoming.  I love living here; a little less traffic would make it perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is located in the high desert, characterized by its dry, dusty landscape.  The lack of greenery is striking, with lawns being a rare and expensive sight.  While the area was once sparsely populated, recent years have seen significant development, blurring the lines between rural and urban life. Despite the growth, the community remains friendly, with a predominantly older demographic.  \n\nShopping options are limited to chain stores, lacking upscale or specialty retailers.  Construction is a dominant industry, likely due to the vast undeveloped land available for building, which worries me as I prefer the current pace of development. I work as a drywall and T-bar installer, a profession tied to the construction boom.\n\nOne of the best aspects of living here is the diverse wildlife. The high desert's unique environment supports a variety of species, reminding us of the importance of coexisting harmoniously with nature. My children, for instance, are fascinated by lizards and desert insects.\n\nWhile Victorville offers some attractions, it's particularly appealing for families seeking a unique desert experience. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a highlight, offering a blend of fun and local flavor.  A nearby trip to Wrightwood allows visitors to enjoy snowy mountain views and winter sports. For those interested in history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum houses exhibits showcasing the region's geological, paleontological, Native American, and industrial heritage.",
            "Describing my neighborhood is a little different from what others might say. While most people picture traditional houses and families, my \"neighborhood\" is actually the college campus where I live. My dorm building and its residents form my immediate community, with the surrounding campus extending that sense of neighborhood, albeit less intensely.  Despite this unique perspective, my campus still shares similarities with typical neighborhoods. It has houses, people, shops, and even a park. \n\nLet's start with the \"houses.\" There are three main types: apartments, traditional houses, and dorm buildings. Apartments house 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor, averaging around 20 residents per building. Traditional houses, available for rent by anyone affiliated with the school, are typically 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these are less common. Dorm rooms, the most prevalent type, house hundreds of students, usually in pairs.\n\nMy school is known for its diversity, and this is reflected in my neighborhood. People from all backgrounds and ages live here. Faculty members tend to live in the traditional houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students opt for apartments. \n\nBeyond housing, my neighborhood pulsates with life.  It boasts a variety of stores, including dining options, school-branded merchandise, and groceries, providing everything residents need. There's also a central park, a shared space where everyone can relax and enjoy themselves, kept safe and clean by the community.",
            "Although initially feeling sad when moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge 10 years ago, I eventually grew accustomed to my new neighborhood. While I made new friends and enemies at school, I formed close bonds with Mr. Glen and his family, who I consider almost like family. \n\nI cherish fond memories like attending Mr. Glen's remarriage, where I caught his wife's wedding favor. I also enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of his daughters, though we haven't met since.\n\nThe neighborhood itself feels like a maze, but I'm gradually exploring it with the help of GPS. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and enjoying life to the fullest. I find solace in nature walks at the local park, practicing balance with sticks and occasionally bringing my bokken wooden sword.\n\nAlthough I haven't played tennis or basketball recently, the courts are a welcome reminder of my childhood, when my dad and Mr. Graves taught me the sport.\n\nLooking back, I've had many enjoyable experiences in this neighborhood, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is conveniently located near my college, which is a major reason I enjoy living there. While primarily composed of apartment buildings, it offers a few affordable and fun restaurants and bars. \n\nOne bar recently underwent a name change and now has higher prices, but the quality of service and drinks remains decent. The neighborhood's residents are mainly students or individuals with lower incomes, reflecting the relatively affordable apartment rentals. The presence of a nearby elementary school adds to the family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nAlthough I don't know my neighbors well, I'm not particularly interested in getting to know them due to their frequent marijuana use. The building management's attempt to mask the smell with an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusingly insulting, highlights this. \n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older but might have modern interiors. Newer apartment complexes down the street, while aesthetically pleasing, have questionable construction quality and overpriced rentals, taking advantage of their proximity to the university.\n\nA budget-friendly eatery nearby serves food on paper plates and mainly relies on microwaved dishes. Across the street is a gas station with a poor reputation. However, recent city improvements have enhanced the area with a wider sidewalk, landscaped medians, and a more pleasant aesthetic.\n\nMy apartment complex is nestled among trees, although a few were removed, leaving behind stumps. In contrast, the street behind my building (43rd street) is less appealing, with deteriorated sidewalks, dilapidated buildings, and a higher crime rate associated with a transient population.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, I appreciate living here. The affordability, proximity to the university, and convenient access to buses and stores make it a suitable place for me.",
            "My neighborhood is a collection of identical duplexes arranged on a cul-de-sac to resemble individual houses. All are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly and often gather at the ends of their driveways in the evenings, chatting while the children play. This simple, close-knit atmosphere is a welcome contrast to the increasingly digital world. The surrounding fields, trees, and clear skies create a peaceful, almost nostalgic ambiance. Recently, however, we've experienced severe weather, including tornado warnings and sirens. During one particularly stormy night, we sought shelter in our homes, witnessing heavy hail and a dramatic temperature drop. Despite the unsettling experience, the aftermath brought a breathtaking double rainbow, which I captured in photographs for my loved ones. Life returned to normal quickly, with families resuming their routines. \n\nAs a recent transplant from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I've found this friendly neighborhood to be a true gem. While all the duplexes look the same from the outside, their interiors vary. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home to a nearby pond, where I've encountered deer and listened to the morning chorus of a bullfrog. The peaceful setting, just forty minutes from Charlotte, is further enhanced by the sounds of roosters crowing from neighboring farms and the occasional braying of a donkey. This close-knit community feels like a village of its own.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood right before starting eighth grade. While making friends initially proved challenging, I eventually forged strong bonds with two neighbors who, sadly, no longer reside here.  Despite the changes, many original residents remain, making it feel like a typical American suburb. \n\nTwo-story houses dominate the landscape, and the weekends, especially when the weather is warm, are filled with the sound of children playing. The neighborhood is generally quiet, with a strong sense of community. I've always felt safe and secure here, never experiencing any issues with neighbors or package theft.  \n\nA park just minutes from my house holds countless memories. I spent countless hours playing basketball, football, and baseball with neighborhood friends, though I also experienced a memorable (and painful) nose injury during a football game. Despite the occasional mishap, the good times outweigh the bad, and now I enjoy taking my younger cousins there for swings and slides.\n\nThe park evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminding me of simpler times.  \n\nThe neighborhood boasts incredible diversity, reflected in the array of restaurants within a one-mile radius, offering everything from Chinese and Indian to Mexican and Italian cuisine. While delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash have become popular, fast food chains and pizza places are also prevalent.  \n\nEssential stores are conveniently located nearby, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens and CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store.  An Indian-owned store caters to those seeking authentic Indian ingredients or ready-made meals.\n\nOverall, I'm incredibly fortunate to call this neighborhood home. Witnessing the challenges others face with their neighbors through social media and news reports makes me truly appreciate the sense of community and safety I experience here.",
            "Johnston, a small South Carolina town, is known for its significant contribution to the agricultural sector, earning it the nickname \"Peach Capital of the World.\"  The town is largely characterized by farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches dominating the landscape. Houses are typically two-story structures with metal roofs or gray shingles, set back from the roads to accommodate fields for farming or animal grazing. \n\nThe town center features a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the limited commercial establishments are located. Residents have a choice of three fast-food options: Hong Kong (a family-owned Chinese restaurant), Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's Burger chain.  A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is known for its unique Cherry Coca-Cola.  \n\nIndependent Grocers Alliance (IGA), the only grocery store in town, is pricey, prompting many residents to travel to nearby Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.  Dollar General, however, is a popular choice for everyday necessities.  Possibilities Furniture & More, a long-standing local business, offers furniture and delivery services, and is attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming establishment.  \n\nMedical care is provided by a doctor's practice and a veterinary clinic, both located outside the main town area.  Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger residents, but students continue their education in the neighboring town for middle and high school.  \n\nWhile lacking traditional recreational facilities like parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is currently under development.  Despite the limited entertainment options, Johnston remains a charming and tight-knit community.",
            "Hearing about my apartment building's connection to a missing person case was a surprise. The area was known for its high rents, and I, along with my friends, hadn't heard any such stories. Despite the financial struggles many faced, we'd learned to be resourceful, finding joy in bargains and secondhand finds. But the reality of living frugally was inescapable, a constant reminder of our circumstances. \n\nMy neighborhood boasts several thrift stores within walking distance, each offering a unique experience. Downtown bustles with activity, but these quiet havens offer a peaceful escape. It's a city in constant development, experiencing the growing pains of rapid expansion.  The atmosphere reminded me of New York: focused individuals pursuing their goals, respecting each other's boundaries. It's a place where solitude is respected, and personal lives are kept private.\n\nLiving here feels more like being part of a community than simply sharing an apartment building. We support each other through life's milestones, offering help and companionship. Despite the impersonal nature of the modernist buildings, my neighbors create a sense of belonging and warmth. Their kindness and consideration make me feel like my life hasn't been a complete failure. I'm grateful for their presence and the sense of connection they bring to this urban sprawl.",
            "My neighborhood is a typical suburban area with a strong homeowner's association presence.  The uniformity is evident in the well-maintained single-family homes, each with a small, similar lawn, decorative stones, a short driveway, and a two-car garage. The roads are in excellent condition, thanks to the HOA's efforts.  \n\nWhile most homes are single-story, some are two-story.  The neighborhood doesn't have traditional mailboxes; instead, there's a centralized mailbox cluster, reminiscent of apartment complexes, with individual mailboxes and larger package lockers.\n\nLocated on the edge of a city, my neighborhood blends suburban living with a rural feel.  We have ample space, featuring community pools, walking trails, and plenty of room for recreation. The community is primarily composed of retirees, creating a safe and friendly environment. There are also some middle-aged and younger professionals.  \n\nAlthough the city itself is surprisingly large, it retains a small-town atmosphere. It offers essential amenities, including a modest mall. While major shopping centers require a 15-minute drive, they provide a wide range of options, from upscale grocery stores to discount outlets.  \n\nOverall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and offers a comfortable suburban lifestyle with convenient access to both community amenities and shopping centers.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town bordering a major city's suburbs. My neighborhood, situated on the east side, is considered the town's most economically disadvantaged area.  While property values are low and mostly occupied by low-income individuals, it's not unattractive or unpleasant. The neighborhood is characterized by friendly residents who greet each other warmly. Although crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, they remain generally low.  There have been isolated incidents of violence, including shootings and a homicide, within a few blocks of my home in the past decade. Sadly, our neighbors experienced the loss of their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has thankfully avoided direct involvement with crime, aside from occasional minor thefts from our porch.\n\nThe town, like many in the US, has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, resulting in numerous fentanyl-related deaths. However, the town offers resources to combat this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families and friends of those struggling with substance abuse.\n\nDespite these challenges, our town has many positive aspects. My son attends an excellent elementary school with dedicated staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel.  He has thrived in the school's positive environment, free from bullying despite his special needs. The active PTO organizes numerous events to promote family engagement and educational progress.  \n\nRecognizing that over 20% of the town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry.  The school fosters an inclusive environment where no family feels marginalized due to financial constraints. School fees, supplies, and field trip costs are also kept reasonable.\n\nThe City Council and staff have made notable improvements to the town's appearance, including road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations.  However, these improvements have primarily been concentrated in the central area and the west side, which houses the commercial district and sees most of the traffic. The east side, where I live, has received less attention, a point of contention for residents in my neighborhood.\n\nOverall, I find joy in living in this town. The people are friendly, the schools are exceptional, there are ample shopping options, both local businesses and larger retail stores, to meet our family's needs, and while our home may not have a high market value, it is comfortable and suitable for our family. We have called this town home for over 16 years and can't envision ourselves living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood, Hilltop, is steeped in history and culture. It's nestled on a hill, surrounded by buildings with significant pasts. I live in a seven-story apartment building across from a historic theater, and a short distance away is a popular arcade bar that draws diverse crowds, especially during warm summer evenings. The neighborhood also boasts a sizable city park, enclosed by concrete and stairs, where during harsh winters, homeless individuals seek shelter in organized rows along the sidewalks and steps.  They congregate here for warmth and proximity to the nearest family center, offering them access to basic necessities. \n\nWhile Hilltop's historical charm is captivating, it's the resilience and warmth of its people that truly define the neighborhood. Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence, a history still echoed in stories passed down through generations. Despite this past, the residents work tirelessly to maintain their community, demonstrating a strong sense of pride and care.\n\nThough a lingering warning persists against white individuals walking alone in the neighborhood after dark, I believe it's a relic of the past, rooted in outdated social conditioning. Perhaps my own background allows me to be seen as one of their own, someone who recognizes the ongoing struggle against racism and prejudice.  \n\nHilltop is more than just a place; it's a feeling. I feel safe and alive walking its streets, encountering kindness and generosity from its residents, who offer help more readily than harm. I've experienced firsthand their compassion, from a laundromat owner extending closing time to charge my phone to someone offering me a five-dollar bill and words of encouragement on a bleak night. Hilltop, with its imperfections and complexities, will always be my home.",
            "I reside in a rural Michigan town, transitioning from farmland to small tourist destinations.  This area lacks large chain stores like malls, Walmart, Target, or even restaurants like Applebee's, requiring car travel for these amenities. Despite this, I live in a stunning location surrounded by water. Both Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix border my town, offering beaches at every turn. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. Houses are spread out, each with a unique character, ranging from updated homes to older, well-maintained ones, many featuring full basements visible from the street. While some houses sport aluminum siding, the neighborhood boasts a vibrant array of colors. Most homes have yards, often filled with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even animal enclosures. \n\nThe neighborhood reflects a strong sense of community, with hardworking individuals raising or having raised families. Children play freely in the streets, while residents are frequently seen walking dogs, biking, rollerblading, and engaging with each other in friendly gestures. Neighbors know one another, creating a distinct sense of belonging. Lawns are well-maintained, reflecting a pride in the community. \n\nWhile the houses may not be architecturally stunning, they convey a sense of warmth and security, ideal for raising a family. The town offers a peaceful and safe environment with essential services like the sheriff's department, jail, health department, and recycling center within walking distance. \n\nRecreational activities abound, with nearby baseball and softball fields, a small airport, and an ice cream parlor. The town park is just a short bike ride away, making it a truly great place to live."
